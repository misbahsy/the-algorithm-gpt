This code defines interfaces and classes for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search using embeddings/vectors. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to query for the nearest neighbors of a given embedding in an index. The code defines several traits and classes that can be used to build, update, and query indexes of embeddings.

The `EmbeddingType` object defines a type alias for an `EmbeddingVector` and provides a `math` object for floating-point operations on embeddings. The `EntityEmbedding` case class represents an entity with an associated embedding. The `Queryable` trait defines a query interface for ANN that takes an embedding, the number of neighbors to query for, and runtime parameters to control accuracy and latency. The `QueryableGrouped` trait extends `Queryable` and adds an optional key parameter to lookup a specific ANN index and perform the query there. The `RuntimeParams` trait defines runtime parameters that can be used to control the behavior of the query.

The `NeighborWithDistance` case class represents a query result with the ID of the nearest neighbor and its distance from the query embedding. The `NeighborWithSeed` case class represents a query result with the ID of the nearest neighbor and the ID of the seed entity for which the query was called. The `NeighborWithDistanceWithSeed` case class represents a query result with the ID of the nearest neighbor, the ID of the seed entity, and the distance from the query embedding.

The `RawAppendable` trait defines an interface for appending embeddings to an index and converting the index to a queryable interface. The `Appendable` trait extends `RawAppendable` and adds an interface for appending entities with embeddings to an index. The `Updatable` trait defines an interface for updating an entity's embedding in an index.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible framework for building, updating, and querying indexes of embeddings for ANN search. It can be used in a variety of applications, such as recommendation systems, search engines, and natural language processing. Here is an example of how to use this code to query for the nearest neighbors of an embedding:

```
val embedding: EmbeddingVector = ...
val numOfNeighbors: Int = ...
val runtimeParams: RuntimeParams = ...
val index: Appendable[String, RuntimeParams, CosineDistance] = ...
val queryableIndex: Queryable[String, RuntimeParams, CosineDistance] = index.toQueryable
val neighbors: Future[List[String]] = queryableIndex.query(embedding, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EmbeddingType` object and what does it contain?
- The `EmbeddingType` object defines a type alias for `EmbeddingVector` and contains a `math` object and a `embeddingSerDe` instance for `Float` type.

2. What is the difference between `Queryable` and `QueryableGrouped` traits?
- `QueryableGrouped` extends `Queryable` and adds an optional `key` parameter to its query methods, allowing for lookup of a specific ANN index to perform the query.

3. What is the purpose of the `RawAppendable` trait and how does it relate to `Queryable` and `Appendable`?
- The `RawAppendable` trait defines a method to append an embedding to an index and provides a method to convert to a `Queryable` interface. It is a lower-level interface compared to `Appendable`, which appends an entity with its embedding, and is used to build up the index.
