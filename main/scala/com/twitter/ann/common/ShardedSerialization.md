The code defines several classes and objects that are used for serializing and deserializing index shards data. The purpose of this code is to provide functionality for building and querying a sharded index. 

The `ShardedSerialization` class takes a list of `Serialization` objects and serializes them to a directory. The `toDirectory` method creates a new directory for each shard and calls the `toDirectory` method of the corresponding `Serialization` object to serialize it to the shard directory. This class is used in conjunction with the `ShardedIndexBuilderWithSerialization` class to build a sharded index and serialize it to a directory.

The `ComposedQueryableDeserialization` class is used to deserialize directories containing index shards data to a composed queryable. The `fromDirectory` method lists all the shard directories in the given directory and deserializes each shard directory using the provided `deserializationFn` function. It then creates a new `ComposedQueryable` object using the deserialized shards. This class is used to query a sharded index that has been serialized to a directory.

The `ShardedIndexBuilderWithSerialization` class is used to build a sharded index and serialize it to a directory. It takes a `ShardedAppendable` object and a `ShardedSerialization` object as input. The `append` method appends an `EntityEmbedding` to the sharded index. The `toDirectory` method serializes the sharded index to a directory using the provided `ShardedSerialization` object. The `toQueryable` method returns a `Queryable` object that can be used to query the sharded index.

Overall, this code provides functionality for building and querying a sharded index. The `ShardedSerialization` and `ShardedIndexBuilderWithSerialization` classes are used to serialize the sharded index to a directory, while the `ComposedQueryableDeserialization` class is used to deserialize the sharded index from a directory. These classes can be used in conjunction with other classes to build and query a sharded index. For example, the `ShardedIndexBuilderWithSerialization` class can be used with the `ComposedQueryableDeserialization` class to build a sharded index, serialize it to a directory, and then deserialize it from the directory for querying.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShardedSerialization` class?
- The `ShardedSerialization` class serializes a list of shards to a directory.

2. What is the purpose of the `ComposedQueryableDeserialization` class?
- The `ComposedQueryableDeserialization` class deserializes directories containing index shards data to a composed queryable.

3. What is the purpose of the `ShardedIndexBuilderWithSerialization` class?
- The `ShardedIndexBuilderWithSerialization` class is an appendable that can serialize its contents to a directory and can be converted to a queryable.
