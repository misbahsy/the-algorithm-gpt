The code defines an object called QueryableOperations that contains an implicit class called Map. This class extends the Queryable class with additional functionality to map runtime parameters. The Queryable class is a generic class that takes three type parameters: T, P, and D. T represents the type of the elements being queried, P represents the runtime parameters used in the query, and D represents the distance metric used in the query.

The mapRuntimeParameters method takes a function f that maps the runtime parameters of type P to a new set of runtime parameters of type P. It returns a new Queryable object that has the same type parameters as the original Queryable object, but with the runtime parameters mapped using the provided function.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to modify the runtime parameters used in a query without having to create a new Queryable object. This can be useful in situations where the same query is being executed multiple times with slightly different parameters.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
val queryable: Queryable[String, MyParams, EuclideanDistance] = ...

// Define a function to modify the runtime parameters
def modifyParams(params: MyParams): MyParams = {
  params.copy(someParam = "new value")
}

// Map the runtime parameters using the modifyParams function
val modifiedQueryable = queryable.mapRuntimeParameters(modifyParams)

// Use the modified queryable to execute a query
val results = modifiedQueryable.query(embedding, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the QueryableOperations object and the Map class within it?
- The QueryableOperations object contains an implicit class called Map that extends the Queryable class. It adds a method called mapRuntimeParameters that allows for modification of the runtime parameters used in querying.

2. What is the significance of the type parameters T, P, and D?
- T represents the type of the elements being queried, P represents the runtime parameters used in querying, and D represents the distance metric used in querying.

3. What is the expected output of the query and queryWithDistance methods?
- The query method is expected to return a Future containing a list of elements of type T, while the queryWithDistance method is expected to return a Future containing a list of NeighborWithDistance objects, which contain both an element of type T and its distance from the query.
