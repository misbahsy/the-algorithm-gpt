The code defines several classes and traits related to sharding and querying embeddings. 

The `ShardFunction` trait defines a single method `apply` that takes in the number of shards and an `EntityEmbedding` object and returns the shard index. The `RandomShardFunction` class is a concrete implementation of `ShardFunction` that randomly assigns a shard index to an `EntityEmbedding` object.

The `ShardedAppendable` class is a sharded appendable that takes in a sequence of appendable indices, a shard function, and the total number of shards. It implements the `Appendable` trait, which defines a single method `append` that takes in an `EntityEmbedding` object and returns a `Future` of `Unit`. The `append` method uses the shard function to determine the shard index of the `EntityEmbedding` object and appends it to the corresponding appendable index.

The `ComposedQueryable` class is a composition of a sequence of queryable indices. It implements the `Queryable` trait, which defines two methods: `query` and `queryWithDistance`. The `query` method takes in an `EmbeddingVector`, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters and returns a `Future` of a list of `T` objects. The `queryWithDistance` method is similar to `query`, but it returns a `Future` of a list of `NeighborWithDistance[T, D]` objects. The `ComposedQueryable` class queries all the indices and merges the results in memory to return the K nearest neighbors.

Overall, this code provides a way to shard and query embeddings efficiently. It can be used in a larger project that involves working with large amounts of embedding data. For example, it can be used in a recommendation system that recommends items to users based on their past behavior. The embeddings can represent the items and users, and the sharded appendable and composed queryable can be used to efficiently store and query the embeddings.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShardFunction` trait and how is it used in the code?
- The `ShardFunction` trait defines a function that shuffles the embedding data into different shards based on the total number of shards and the data. It is used as a parameter in the `ShardedAppendable` class to determine which shard to append the data to.

2. What is the difference between the `RandomShardFunction` and `ShardedAppendable` classes?
- The `RandomShardFunction` class randomly shuffles the embedding data into different shards based on the total number of shards, while the `ShardedAppendable` class appends the data to a specific shard determined by the `ShardFunction` parameter.

3. What is the purpose of the `ComposedQueryable` class and how does it work?
- The `ComposedQueryable` class is a composition of multiple queryable indices that queries all the indices and merges the results in memory to return the K nearest neighbors. It works by querying each index for the nearest neighbors, sorting the results by distance, and returning the top K neighbors.
