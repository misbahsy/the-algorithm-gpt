The `QueryableByIdImplementation` class is an implementation of the `QueryableById` trait. It composes an `EmbeddingProducer` and a `Queryable` to provide nearest neighbors given an id of type `T1`. The `EmbeddingProducer` provides an embedding given an id, while the `Queryable` provides a list of neighbors given an embedding. 

The class takes four type parameters: `T1` is the type of the query, `T2` is the type of the result, `P` is a type parameter that specifies the runtime parameters supported by the index, and `D` is the distance function used in the index. 

The class provides four methods that implement the methods of the `QueryableById` trait. 

The `queryById` method takes an id of type `T1`, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters of type `P`. It produces an embedding for the id using the `embeddingProducer`, and then calls the `query` method of the `Queryable` to get the nearest neighbors. The result is returned as a `Stitch` object, which is a type of future that can be composed with other `Stitch` objects. 

The `queryByIdWithDistance` method is similar to `queryById`, but it returns the nearest neighbors along with their distances. 

The `batchQueryById` method takes a sequence of ids of type `T1`, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters of type `P`. It produces embeddings for all the ids using the `embeddingProducer`, and then calls the `query` method of the `Queryable` to get the nearest neighbors for each id. The result is returned as a list of `NeighborWithSeed` objects, which contain the original id along with the nearest neighbor. 

The `batchQueryWithDistanceById` method is similar to `batchQueryById`, but it returns the nearest neighbors along with their distances. 

Overall, this class provides a way to get nearest neighbors given an id by composing an `EmbeddingProducer` and a `Queryable`. It can be used in a larger project that requires similarity search or nearest neighbor search. 

Example usage:

```scala
val embeddingProducer = new MyEmbeddingProducer()
val queryable = new MyQueryable()
val queryableById = new QueryableByIdImplementation(embeddingProducer, queryable)

val id = "myId"
val numOfNeighbors = 10
val runtimeParams = new MyRuntimeParams()

val neighbors = queryableById.queryById(id, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams).get()
val neighborsWithDistance = queryableById.queryByIdWithDistance(id, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams).get()
val batchNeighbors = queryableById.batchQueryById(Seq(id), numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams).get()
val batchNeighborsWithDistance = queryableById.batchQueryWithDistanceById(Seq(id), numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
