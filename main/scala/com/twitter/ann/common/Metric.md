This code defines a set of distance metrics used in the context of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. ANN search is a technique used to find the nearest neighbors of a given query point in a high-dimensional space. The distance metrics defined in this code are used to compute the distance between two points in the space. 

The code defines five distance metrics: L2 distance, cosine distance, inner product distance, and edit distance. Each distance metric is defined as a case class that extends the `Distance` trait. The `Distance` trait defines a single method `distance` that returns the distance between two points. The `Ordered` trait is also extended, which allows distances to be compared and sorted. 

The `Metric` object defines a mapping between the distance metrics used in the code and the distance metrics used in the Thrift service. The `fromThrift` method maps a Thrift distance metric to a Scala distance metric, and the `toThrift` method maps a Scala distance metric to a Thrift distance metric. The `fromString` method maps a string representation of a distance metric to a Scala distance metric. 

Each distance metric is defined as an object that extends the `Metric` trait. The `Metric` trait defines three methods: `distance`, `absoluteDistance`, and `fromAbsoluteDistance`. The `distance` method computes the distance between two points using the specific distance metric. The `absoluteDistance` method returns the absolute distance between two points. The `fromAbsoluteDistance` method creates a new instance of the distance metric from an absolute distance value. 

Each distance metric object also extends the `Injection` trait, which allows the distance metric to be converted to and from a Thrift service distance metric. The `apply` method converts a Scala distance metric to a Thrift distance metric, and the `invert` method converts a Thrift distance metric to a Scala distance metric. 

The `MetricUtil` object defines utility methods used to compute the distance metrics. The `dot` method computes the dot product between two vectors. The `l2distance` method computes the L2 distance between two vectors. The `cosineSimilarity` method computes the cosine similarity between two vectors. The `norm` method normalizes a vector. 

Overall, this code provides a set of distance metrics that can be used in the context of ANN search. The distance metrics can be used to compute the distance between two points in a high-dimensional space, which is a key component of ANN search. The code also provides utility methods for computing the distance metrics.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Distance` trait and its implementations?
- The `Distance` trait is used to represent a distance metric between two embeddings, and its implementations (`L2Distance`, `CosineDistance`, `InnerProductDistance`, and `EditDistance`) provide specific implementations of this metric.

2. What is the purpose of the `Metric` trait and its implementations?
- The `Metric` trait is used to represent a distance metric between two embeddings, and its implementations (`L2`, `Cosine`, `InnerProduct`, and `Edit`) provide specific implementations of this metric along with methods for converting to and from Thrift representations.

3. What is the purpose of the `MetricUtil` object?
- The `MetricUtil` object provides utility methods for computing various distance metrics (`dot`, `l2distance`, `cosineSimilarity`, and `norm`) that are used by the `Metric` implementations.
