The `ServiceClientQueryable` class is a queryable client for a nearest neighbor search service. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a service that implements the `NearestNeighborQuery` and `NearestNeighborResult` Thrift structs. The purpose of this class is to provide a simple interface for querying the nearest neighbor service with a given embedding vector and runtime parameters, and returning a list of the nearest neighbors.

The `ServiceClientQueryable` class takes four type parameters: `T`, `P`, `D`, and `embeddingSerDe`. `T` is the type of the objects being queried, `P` is the type of the runtime parameters, `D` is the type of the distance metric being used, and `embeddingSerDe` is an instance of the `EmbeddingSerDe` trait, which is used to serialize and deserialize the embedding vectors.

The `ServiceClientQueryable` class implements the `Queryable` trait, which defines two methods: `query` and `queryWithDistance`. Both methods take an embedding vector, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters as input, and return a `Future` containing a list of the nearest neighbors. The `query` method returns a list of `T` objects, while the `queryWithDistance` method returns a list of `NeighborWithDistance[T, D]` objects, which contain both the nearest neighbor and its distance from the query vector.

The `ServiceClientQueryable` class uses the `Injection` trait from the `bijection` library to convert between the Thrift structs used by the service and the types used by the client. It also uses the `Service` trait from the `finagle` library to communicate with the service.

Overall, the `ServiceClientQueryable` class provides a convenient and type-safe way to query a nearest neighbor search service, and can be used as a building block for larger machine learning and data processing pipelines. Here is an example of how the `query` method might be used:

```
val client = new ServiceClientQueryable[MyObject, MyRuntimeParams, MyDistance](
  service,
  runtimeParamInjection,
  distanceInjection,
  idInjection
)

val embedding = EmbeddingVector(Seq(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
val runtimeParams = MyRuntimeParams(...)
val numOfNeighbors = 10

val result: Future[List[MyObject]] = client.query(embedding, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `ServiceClientQueryable` that implements the `Queryable` trait. It provides methods for querying a nearest neighbor service with a given embedding vector and runtime parameters.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries, including `com.twitter.ann.common.EmbeddingType`, `com.twitter.ann.common.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.bijection.Injection`, `com.twitter.finagle.Service`, and `com.twitter.mediaservices.commons.codec.ArrayByteBufferCodec`.

3. What is the expected input and output format for the `query` and `queryWithDistance` methods?
- Both methods take an `EmbeddingVector`, an integer `numOfNeighbors`, and a runtime parameter object of type `P`. The `query` method returns a `Future` containing a list of objects of type `T`, while the `queryWithDistance` method returns a `Future` containing a list of `NeighborWithDistance` objects, which contain an object of type `T` and a distance object of type `D`.
