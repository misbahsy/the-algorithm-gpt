The `IndexTransformer` object provides utility functions to transform raw indexes to typed indexes using a `Store`. The purpose of this code is to enable querying and appending of typed indexes, which are more convenient to work with than raw indexes. 

The `transformQueryable` function takes a raw queryable index of type `Queryable[Long, P, D]` and a `ReadableStore[Long, T]` that provides mappings between `Long` and `T`. It returns a queryable index typed on `T` of type `Queryable[T, P, D]`. The returned index can be queried using an `EmbeddingVector` and runtime parameters `P` to get a list of `T` objects that are the nearest neighbors of the query. The function first queries the raw index to get a list of `Long` ids of the nearest neighbors, then uses the `store` to get the corresponding `T` objects and returns them as a list.

The `transformAppendable` function takes a raw appendable index of type `RawAppendable[P, D]` and a `Store[Long, T]` that provides mappings between `Long` and `T`. It returns an appendable index typed on `T` of type `Appendable[T, P, D]`. The returned index can be appended with an `EntityEmbedding[T]` object, which contains an `EmbeddingVector` and an `id` of type `T`. The function first appends the `EmbeddingVector` to the raw index to get a `Long` id, then stores the mapping between the `Long` id and the `T` id in the `store`.

The `transform1` function takes a raw appendable and queryable index of type `Index` and a `Store[Long, T]` that provides mappings between `Long` and `T`. It returns an index that is both appendable and queryable, typed on `T` of type `Queryable[T, P, D] with Appendable[T, P, D]`. The returned index can be queried or appended with `T` objects. The function first transforms the raw index to a queryable index and an appendable index using the `transformQueryable` and `transformAppendable` functions, then returns an object that implements both interfaces by delegating to the queryable and appendable objects. 

Overall, this code provides a way to work with typed indexes that are more convenient to use than raw indexes. It enables querying and appending of these indexes using `Store`s that provide mappings between `Long` and `T`. This code is likely used in the larger project to enable efficient nearest neighbor search on embeddings of `T` objects. 

Example usage:

```
val rawIndex: RawAppendable[MyRuntimeParams, MyDistance] with Queryable[Long, MyRuntimeParams, MyDistance] = ...
val store: Store[Long, MyObject] = ...

val typedIndex: Queryable[MyObject, MyRuntimeParams, MyDistance] with Appendable[MyObject, MyRuntimeParams, MyDistance] = 
  IndexTransformer.transform1(rawIndex, store)

val queryResult: Future[List[MyObject]] = typedIndex.query(embedding, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams)

val appendResult: Future[Unit] = typedIndex.append(EntityEmbedding(embedding, id))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IndexTransformer` object?
- The `IndexTransformer` object provides utility functions to transform raw index to typed index using Store.

2. What types of indexes can be transformed using the `transform1` function?
- The `transform1` function can transform a long type appendable and queryable index to Typed appendable and queryable index.

3. What is the purpose of the `store` parameter in the `transformQueryable` function?
- The `store` parameter in the `transformQueryable` function is a readable store that provides mappings between Long and T, which is used to transform a long type queryable index to Typed queryable index.
