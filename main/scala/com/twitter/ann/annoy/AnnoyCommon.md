The code defines a set of common utilities and parameters for the Annoy algorithm implementation used in the Twitter project. The Annoy algorithm is a library for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. 

The `AnnoyCommon` object defines a set of constants and a `RuntimeParamsInjection` object that converts `AnnoyRuntimeParams` to `ServiceRuntimeParams`. The `AnnoyRuntimeParams` case class defines a single parameter `nodesToExplore` which is the number of vectors to evaluate while searching for nearest neighbors. 

The `MetadataCodec` is a lazy val that defines a ThriftByteBufferCodec for `AnnoyIndexMetadata`. The `IndexFileName`, `MetaDataFileName`, and `IndexIdMappingFileName` are constants that define the names of the files used to store the index, metadata, and ID mapping respectively. 

The code is used to define common parameters and utilities for the Annoy algorithm implementation. The `AnnoyRuntimeParams` case class is used to specify the number of vectors to evaluate while searching for nearest neighbors. The `AnnoyCommon` object defines constants and a codec for the metadata used in the Annoy index. These utilities and parameters are used throughout the Annoy implementation in the Twitter project. 

Example usage:
```
val annoyParams = AnnoyRuntimeParams(Some(100))
val serviceParams = AnnoyCommon.RuntimeParamsInjection(annoyParams)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a Scala object and a case class for the Annoy algorithm, which is used for approximate nearest neighbor search. It also includes an injection object for converting runtime parameters between Scala and Thrift formats.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and libraries, including com.twitter.ann.common, com.twitter.bijection, and com.twitter.mediaservices.commons.codec.

3. What is the significance of the lazy val MetadataCodec and how is it used?
- The MetadataCodec is a ThriftByteBufferCodec object that is used to serialize and deserialize AnnoyIndexMetadata objects. It is defined as a lazy val to ensure that it is only instantiated when it is first accessed, rather than when the object is first loaded.
