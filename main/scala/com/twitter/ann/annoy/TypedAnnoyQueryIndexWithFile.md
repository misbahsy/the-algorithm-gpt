The code defines two classes and a companion object that are used to create a queryable index for the Annoy approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to deserialize a previously serialized Annoy index from a file and make it queryable. 

The `TypedAnnoyQueryIndexWithFile` class is the main class that provides the functionality to deserialize the index from a file and make it queryable. It takes in several parameters, including the dimension of the index, the metric used to calculate distances between points, an injection object that is used to serialize and deserialize the data, a future pool to execute asynchronous tasks, and a directory where the index is stored. 

The `fromDirectory` method of the `TypedAnnoyQueryIndexWithFile` class is responsible for deserializing the index from the file and returning a queryable index. It first creates a `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` object using the `dimension`, `metric`, `futurePool`, and `directory` parameters. Then, it creates an `IndexIdMappingFileName` file in the directory and uses it to create a `ReadableIndexIdFileStore` object. Finally, it calls the `IndexTransformer.transformQueryable` method to transform the `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` object into a `Queryable` object that can be used to query the index.

The `apply` method of the companion object is a convenience method that creates a `TypedAnnoyQueryIndexWithFile` object and calls its `fromDirectory` method to return a queryable index. It takes in the same parameters as the `TypedAnnoyQueryIndexWithFile` constructor and returns a `Queryable` object.

Overall, this code provides a way to deserialize a previously serialized Annoy index from a file and make it queryable. This functionality can be used in a larger project that requires fast approximate nearest neighbor search, such as recommendation systems or image search engines. An example usage of this code would be to create an Annoy index of image features and store it in a file. Then, the index can be deserialized and made queryable using this code to perform fast image search.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a way to create a queryable index for a given type T using the Annoy algorithm, which is a fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm. It solves the problem of efficiently searching for nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method in `TypedAnnoyQueryIndexWithFile`?
- The `apply` method takes in the dimension of the space, a metric for distance calculation, an injection for serializing/deserializing objects of type T, a future pool for asynchronous execution, and a directory for storing the index. It returns a `Queryable` object that can be used to query the index.

3. What is the purpose of the `fromDirectory` method in `TypedAnnoyQueryIndexWithFile`?
- The `fromDirectory` method deserializes a queryable index from a given directory by creating a `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` object and transforming it using an `IndexTransformer` object that reads from an index ID file. The resulting `Queryable` object can be used to query the index.
