The code defines a class and an object that are used to query an Annoy index. Annoy is a C++ library for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The Annoy index is a data structure that is built from a set of high-dimensional vectors and is used to find the nearest neighbors of a given vector. The Annoy index is built by partitioning the vectors into a set of trees, where each tree is built by recursively splitting the vectors along a random axis. The Annoy index is then used to find the nearest neighbors of a given vector by traversing the trees and finding the closest vectors.

The RawAnnoyQueryIndex class is used to query an Annoy index. The class takes as input the dimension of the vectors, the metric used to compute the distance between vectors, the number of trees in the index, the index itself, and a FuturePool. The class provides two methods for querying the index: query and queryWithDistance. The query method takes as input an embedding vector, the number of neighbors to find, and AnnoyRuntimeParams. The method returns a Future that resolves to a list of the IDs of the nearest neighbors. The queryWithDistance method is similar to the query method, but it also returns the distances between the query vector and the nearest neighbors.

The RawAnnoyQueryIndex object provides two methods: apply and loadIndex. The apply method is used to create a new RawAnnoyQueryIndex instance from a directory that contains the index files. The method reads the metadata file to get the dimension and metric of the index, checks that they match the requested dimension and metric, loads the index from the index file, and returns a new RawAnnoyQueryIndex instance. The loadIndex method is used to load an ANNIndex from an index file. The method checks if the index file is a local file, and if not, copies it to a local file so that it can be memory mapped. The method then creates a new ANNIndex instance from the index file and returns it.

Overall, the RawAnnoyQueryIndex class and object provide a convenient way to query an Annoy index. The class provides a simple interface for querying the index, while the object provides methods for loading the index from disk. The code is likely used in a larger project that uses Annoy to perform approximate nearest neighbor search. An example of how the code might be used is shown below:

```
val indexDirectory = new LocalFile("/path/to/index")
val index = RawAnnoyQueryIndex(
  dimension = 128,
  metric = Cosine,
  futurePool = FuturePool.unboundedPool,
  directory = indexDirectory
)
val queryVector = EmbeddingVector(Array.fill(128)(0.0))
val numOfNeighbours = 10
val runtimeParams = AnnoyRuntimeParams(nodesToExplore = Some(100))
val result = index.query(queryVector, numOfNeighbours, runtimeParams)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a way to query an Annoy index with a given embedding vector and returns a list of nearest neighbors with their distances.
2. What dependencies does this code have and what do they do?
- This code depends on several libraries including Annoy, Spotify, and Twitter libraries. Annoy is a C++ library for approximate nearest neighbors, Spotify is a music streaming service, and Twitter is a social media platform. These libraries provide functionality for loading and querying Annoy indexes, encoding and decoding metadata, and working with file resources.
3. What is the role of the `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` class and how is it used?
- The `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` class is used to query an Annoy index with a given embedding vector and returns a list of nearest neighbors with their distances. It implements the `Queryable` interface and overrides the `query` and `queryWithDistance` methods to perform the query. It also implements the `AutoCloseable` interface to close the memory map based file resource.
