[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/ann/src/main/scala/com/twitter/ann/annoy/RawAnnoyIndexBuilder.scala)

The code defines a class and an object that are used to build and serialize an Annoy index. Annoy is a library for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The Annoy index is built by adding embedding vectors to it, and it can be queried to find the nearest neighbors of a given vector. 

The `RawAnnoyIndexBuilder` class is a builder for the Annoy index. It takes as input the dimension of the embedding vectors, the number of trees to build in the index, the distance metric to use (either L2 or cosine), and a `FuturePool` to execute the index building asynchronously. The class implements the `RawAppendable` trait, which defines a method `append` that adds an embedding vector to the index. The `append` method is thread-safe, as it uses an `AsyncSemaphore` to ensure that only one thread can access the underlying index at a time. The class also implements the `Serialization` trait, which defines methods to serialize the index to a directory.

The `RawAnnoyIndexBuilder` class is used by the `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` class, which is a queryable Annoy index. The `toQueryable` method of the `RawAnnoyIndexBuilder` class returns a `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` object that can be used to query the index. The `RawAnnoyQueryIndex` class takes as input the dimension of the embedding vectors, the distance metric to use, a `FuturePool` to execute the queries asynchronously, and a directory where the serialized index is stored. The class implements the `Queryable` trait, which defines a method `findNearest` that finds the nearest neighbors of a given vector.

The code also defines a `RawAnnoyIndexBuilder` object that has two private methods. The `apply` method is a factory method that creates a new `RawAnnoyIndexBuilder` object. The `annoyMetric` method maps the distance metric used by Annoy to the distance metric used by the `Metric` class defined in the code. The `Metric` class defines two distance metrics: L2 and cosine. If a different distance metric is used, the `annoyMetric` method throws a runtime exception.

Overall, this code provides a way to build and query an Annoy index. It can be used in a larger project that requires approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces, such as recommendation systems, image search, or natural language processing. An example of how to use this code to build an Annoy index and query it is shown below:

```scala
val dimension = 100
val numOfTrees = 10
val metric = L2
val futurePool = FuturePool.unboundedPool

val builder = RawAnnoyIndexBuilder(dimension, numOfTrees, metric, futurePool)

val embeddings = Seq.fill(1000)(EmbeddingVector.random(dimension))

embeddings.foreach(builder.append)

val index = builder.toQueryable

val query = EmbeddingVector.random(dimension)

val neighbors = index.findNearest(query, 10)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and it provides functionality for building a raw Annoy index. Annoy is a library for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. This code allows for the creation of an index that can be queried to find the nearest neighbors of a given vector.

2. What dependencies does this code have and what are their roles?
- This code has several dependencies, including AnnoyLib, AsyncSemaphore, and FuturePool. AnnoyLib is the main library used for building the index, AsyncSemaphore is used to ensure that only one thread can access the index at a time, and FuturePool is used to execute the index building asynchronously.

3. What is the threading model used in this code and why?
- This code uses a single-threaded model for building the index, as multithreaded index building is not supported. This is why AsyncSemaphore is used to ensure that only one thread can access the index at a time. The reason for this is likely due to the fact that building an index can be a computationally expensive task, and multithreading may not provide significant performance benefits.
