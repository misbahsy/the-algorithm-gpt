The `ReadableIndexIdFileStore` object provides a method to create a file-based `ReadableStore` that maps `Long` indexIds to values of type `V`. The purpose of this code is to read a serialized mapping of indexIds to values from a file and create a `ReadableStore` that can be used to retrieve values by their corresponding indexIds.

The `apply` method takes two parameters: `file` and `injection`. `file` is the path to the file containing the serialized mapping of indexIds to values. `injection` is an instance of `Injection` that is used to convert bytes to values of type `V`. The method returns a `ReadableStore` that maps indexIds to values of type `V`.

The `loadFile` method is a private helper method that reads the contents of the file specified by `file` and returns a `ByteBuffer` containing the file contents.

The `apply` method uses the `ThriftByteBufferCodec` to decode the contents of the file into a `FileBasedIndexIdStore` object. The `FileBasedIndexIdStore` object contains a map of indexIds to `ByteBuffer`s. The method then converts this map to a `Map[Long, V]` by using the `injection` to convert each `ByteBuffer` to a value of type `V`. Finally, the method creates a `ReadableStore` from the resulting `Map[Long, V]` and returns it.

This code can be used in the larger project to provide a way to store and retrieve values by their corresponding indexIds. The `ReadableStore` created by this code can be used by other parts of the project to retrieve values based on their indexIds. For example, if the project has a set of documents that are indexed by their document IDs, this code can be used to create a `ReadableStore` that maps document IDs to the corresponding documents. Other parts of the project can then use this `ReadableStore` to retrieve documents by their IDs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an object called `ReadableIndexIdFileStore` that provides a method for creating a file-based `ReadableStore` object that maps `Long` index IDs to values of a specified type `V`, given a file path and an `Injection` object to convert bytes to `V`.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other libraries and packages, including `com.twitter.ann.common.thriftscala.FileBasedIndexIdStore`, `com.twitter.bijection.Injection`, `com.twitter.mediaservices.commons.codec`, and `com.twitter.search.common.file.AbstractFile`.

3. What is the format of the file that is being read?
- The file being read is expected to contain a serialized mapping of `Long` index IDs to byte buffers, which are then converted to values of type `V` using the provided `Injection` object. The specific format of the file is not described in this code.
