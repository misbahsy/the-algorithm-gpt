The `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class is a file-based store for mapping long index IDs to typed IDs. It is used to serialize and store the mapping in thrift format. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class has a companion object called `WritableIndexIdFileStore` that has a single method called `apply`. This method takes an injection object that converts typed IDs to bytes and returns a new instance of the `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class.

The `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class implements the `Store` trait, which defines two methods: `get` and `put`. The `get` method takes a long index ID and returns a future that resolves to an option of the corresponding typed ID. The `put` method takes a tuple of a long index ID and an option of a typed ID and returns a future that resolves to unit.

The `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class has two additional methods: `save` and `getInjection`. The `save` method takes an `IndexOutputFile` object and serializes the mapping in thrift format to the file. The `getInjection` method returns the injection object used to convert typed IDs to bytes.

The `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class uses a `JConcurrentHashMap` to store the mapping between long index IDs and typed IDs. The `toThrift` method converts the map to a `FileBasedIndexIdStore` object, which is a thrift struct that contains an optional map of long index IDs to byte arrays. The `saveThrift` method serializes the `FileBasedIndexIdStore` object to bytes and writes them to the specified file.

Overall, the `WritableIndexIdFileStore` class provides a convenient way to store and retrieve mappings between long index IDs and typed IDs in a file-based format. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to build more complex algorithms that require efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a file-based writable store for mapping long index IDs to values of a certain type, with methods for getting and putting values, as well as serializing and saving the mapping in Thrift format.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other libraries, including com.twitter.ann.common, com.twitter.bijection, com.twitter.mediaservices.commons, and com.twitter.storehaus.

3. What is the advantage of using a ConcurrentHashMap in this code?
- The use of a ConcurrentHashMap allows for thread-safe access to the map storing the index ID-value mappings, which is important for concurrent access in a multi-threaded environment.
