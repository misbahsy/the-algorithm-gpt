[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/ann/src/main/scala/com/twitter/ann/scalding/offline/ParameterlessQueryable.scala)

The code defines a case class called `ParameterlessQueryable` that takes three type parameters: `T`, `P`, and `D`. It has a private access modifier and is located in the `com.twitter.ann.scalding.offline` package. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to query a `Queryable` object with a given `EmbeddingVector` and return a list of approximate nearest neighbors with their distances. The `Queryable` object is passed as a parameter to the `ParameterlessQueryable` constructor along with a `RuntimeParams` object that will be used for all queries. 

The `queryWithDistance` method takes an `EmbeddingVector` and an integer `numOfNeighbors` as parameters and returns a `Future` that resolves to a list of `NeighborWithDistance` objects. Each `NeighborWithDistance` object contains a neighbor of type `T` and its distance of type `D` from the query embedding. 

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves machine learning and data analysis. The `Queryable` object is likely a data structure that holds embeddings or vectors for a large dataset. The `ParameterlessQueryable` class provides a convenient way to query this dataset for nearest neighbors using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. ANN search is a technique used to find the nearest neighbors of a query point in high-dimensional spaces. It is commonly used in machine learning applications such as recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.ann.common.EmbeddingType.EmbeddingVector
import com.twitter.ann.common.{Distance, NeighborWithDistance, Queryable, RuntimeParams}
import com.twitter.util.Future

// create a Queryable object with embeddings
val data: Queryable[EmbeddingVector, RuntimeParams, Distance] = ...

// create a ParameterlessQueryable object with the Queryable and RuntimeParams
val pq: ParameterlessQueryable[EmbeddingVector, RuntimeParams, Distance] = 
  ParameterlessQueryable(data, new RuntimeParams(...))

// query for the 10 nearest neighbors of a given embedding
val embedding: EmbeddingVector = ...
val numOfNeighbors: Int = 10
val neighbors: Future[List[NeighborWithDistance[EmbeddingVector, Distance]]] = 
  pq.queryWithDistance(embedding, numOfNeighbors)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a case class for performing approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries on a queryable object. It likely fits into a larger project related to machine learning or data analysis.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `queryWithDistance` method?
- The `queryWithDistance` method takes in an embedding vector and a number of neighbors to query for, and returns a future containing a list of neighbor objects with their distances from the query embedding.

3. What is the significance of the `runtimeParamsForAllQueries` parameter?
- The `runtimeParamsForAllQueries` parameter is a type parameter that specifies the runtime parameters to be used for all queries performed with this object. This allows for consistent parameter settings across multiple queries.
