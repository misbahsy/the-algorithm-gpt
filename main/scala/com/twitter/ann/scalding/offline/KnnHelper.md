This code is part of a larger project that deals with finding the nearest neighbors for a given set of entities, such as users or items, based on their embeddings. The main purpose of this code is to provide various methods to calculate the nearest neighbors for a given set of query embeddings and search space embeddings using different strategies, such as brute force or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms.

The `KnnHelper` object contains several methods to achieve this goal:

1. `getFilteredUserEmbeddings`: This method filters user embeddings based on a given filter path. It can be used to preprocess the input data before calculating the nearest neighbors.

2. `getNeighborsPipe`: This method calculates the nearest neighbors for a given set of consumer embeddings using either an ANN index or a brute force approach. The result is a `TypedPipe` containing the nearest neighbors for each consumer.

3. `bruteForceNearestNeighbors`: This method calculates the nearest neighbors using a brute force approach by computing the cosine similarity between all pairs of consumer and producer embeddings.

4. `findNearestNeighbours`: This method calculates the nearest neighbors for a given set of query and search space embeddings using a specified distance metric and various optimization parameters, such as the number of reducers, mappers, and search groups.

5. `findNearestNeighboursWithIndexingStrategy`: This method calculates the nearest neighbors using a specified indexing strategy, such as ANN or brute force, and various optimization parameters, such as the number of search groups, replicas, and shards.

6. `nearestNeighborsToString`: This method converts the nearest neighbors result into a string format for easy output and visualization.

These methods can be used in combination to preprocess the input data, calculate the nearest neighbors using different strategies, and output the results in a human-readable format. For example, one can use `getFilteredUserEmbeddings` to filter the input data, then use `getNeighborsPipe` or `findNearestNeighbours` to calculate the nearest neighbors, and finally use `nearestNeighborsToString` to output the results.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `KnnHelper` object and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `KnnHelper` object contains methods to help with finding the nearest neighbors for a given set of user embeddings. It provides methods to filter user embeddings, get neighbors using different strategies (brute force or using an index), and find nearest neighbors using different indexing strategies.

2. **Question**: What is the role of the `findNearestNeighbours` method and its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `findNearestNeighbours` method calculates the nearest neighbors exhaustively between two sets of entity embeddings (query and search space) using a specified distance metric. It takes several parameters such as the query and search space embeddings, distance metric, number of neighbors to find, optional filters for query ids, and various configuration options for reducers, mappers, and optimization flags.

3. **Question**: How does the `nearestNeighborsToString` method work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `nearestNeighborsToString` method takes a tuple of query entity id and a sequence of neighbor entities with their distances, and converts it into a formatted string. The purpose of this method is to provide a human-readable representation of the nearest neighbors, with customizable separators for ids and distances, and neighbor entities.
