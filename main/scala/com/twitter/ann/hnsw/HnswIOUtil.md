The `HnswIOUtil` object provides utility methods for loading and saving embeddings and index metadata for the HNSW algorithm implementation in the Twitter project. 

The `loadEmbeddings` method takes an `embeddingFile` of type `AbstractFile`, an `injection` of type `Injection[T, Array[Byte]]`, and an `idEmbeddingMap` of type `IdEmbeddingMap[T]`. It reads the embeddings from the `embeddingFile` and deserializes them using the `ThriftIteratorIO` class. It then uses the `PersistedEmbeddingInjection` class to invert the deserialized embeddings and add them to the `idEmbeddingMap`. The `loadEmbeddings` method returns the `idEmbeddingMap` with the added embeddings.

The `saveEmbeddings` method takes an `OutputStream` `stream`, an `injection` of type `Injection[T, Array[Byte]]`, and an iterator of `(T, EmbeddingVector)` tuples. It serializes the embeddings using the `PersistedEmbeddingInjection` class and writes them to the `stream` using the `ThriftIteratorIO` class.

The `saveIndexMetadata` method takes the `dimension`, `metric`, `numElements`, and `metadataStream` as arguments. It creates an `HnswIndexMetadata` object with the given parameters and encodes it using the `MetadataCodec` class. It then writes the encoded metadata to the `metadataStream`.

The `loadIndexMetadata` method takes a `metadataFile` of type `AbstractFile` and reads the metadata from it using the `ArrayByteBufferCodec` and `MetadataCodec` classes. It returns the deserialized `HnswIndexMetadata` object.

These utility methods are used to load and save embeddings and index metadata for the HNSW algorithm implementation in the Twitter project. They provide a convenient way to serialize and deserialize embeddings and metadata, which can be used to store and retrieve them from disk or other storage systems.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides utility functions for loading and saving embeddings and index metadata in the HNSW algorithm implementation from Twitter.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guava, Bijection, and a codec from Twitter Media Services.

3. What is the visibility of the methods in this code and why is it important?
- The methods in this code have package-private visibility, except for a few that are marked as visible for testing. This is important because it limits the scope of these methods to the package they are in, which can help with encapsulation and maintainability. The methods that are marked as visible for testing are made public only for testing purposes, which allows for easier testing without exposing these methods to external code.
