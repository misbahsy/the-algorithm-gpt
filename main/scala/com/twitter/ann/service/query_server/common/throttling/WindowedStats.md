The `WindowedStats` class is a simple ring buffer that keeps track of long values over a specified window. It is used for throttling requests in the larger project. 

The class takes an integer `window` as a parameter in its constructor. This parameter specifies the size of the ring buffer. The class has four private variables: `buffer`, `index`, `sumValue`, and `count`. 

The `buffer` variable is an array of long values with a size equal to the `window` parameter. The `index` variable is an integer that keeps track of the current index in the buffer. The `sumValue` variable is a long that keeps track of the sum of all values in the buffer. The `count` variable is an integer that keeps track of the number of values in the buffer.

The `add` method takes a long value `v` as a parameter and adds it to the buffer. If the buffer is not full, the value is added to the next available index. If the buffer is full, the oldest value in the buffer is replaced with the new value. The `sumValue` variable is updated to reflect the new sum of all values in the buffer.

The `avg` method returns the average value of all values in the buffer. It does this by dividing the `sumValue` variable by the `count` variable. 

The `sum` method returns the sum of all values in the buffer. It simply returns the `sumValue` variable.

This class is used in the larger project to throttle requests. The `add` method is called every time a request is made, and the `avg` method is used to calculate the average number of requests made over the specified window. If the average number of requests exceeds a certain threshold, further requests are throttled. 

Example usage:

```
val windowedStats = new WindowedStats(10)
windowedStats.add(5)
windowedStats.add(10)
windowedStats.add(15)
println(windowedStats.avg) // Output: 10.0
println(windowedStats.sum) // Output: 30
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a class called `WindowedStats` that implements a simple ring buffer to keep track of long values over a specified window. It is likely used for throttling or rate limiting purposes in the larger project.

2. What is the significance of the `private[throttling]` modifier before the class definition?
- This modifier makes the class `WindowedStats` accessible only within the `throttling` package, meaning it cannot be accessed or used outside of this package.

3. How does the `add` method work and what does it do?
- The `add` method takes a long value `v` and adds it to the ring buffer. If the buffer is full, it overwrites the oldest value with the new value. It also updates the sum of all values in the buffer and the count of values in the buffer.
