The `BaseQueryIndexServer` class is a configuration class that provides most of the configuration needed for logging, stats, deciders, etc. for a Thrift server. This class extends the `ThriftServer` class and implements the `Mtls` trait. It also imports several modules and classes from the `com.twitter` package.

The purpose of this class is to provide a base configuration for a Thrift server that serves as a query index server. It defines two abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass: `additionalModules` and `addController`. The `additionalModules` method returns a sequence of Guice modules that will be used to configure the server. The `addController` method adds a controller to the Thrift router.

The `modules` method is overridden to include the `DeciderModule` and `MtlsThriftWebFormsModule` modules, as well as any additional modules returned by the `additionalModules` method. The `configureThrift` method is also overridden to add several filters to the Thrift router, including `LoggingMDCFilter`, `TraceIdMDCFilter`, `ThriftMDCFilter`, `AccessLoggingFilter`, and `StatsFilter`. Finally, the `addController` method is called to add the controller to the Thrift router.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a larger project:

```scala
package com.example.query_index_server

import com.google.inject.Module
import com.twitter.finatra.thrift.ThriftServer
import com.twitter.finatra.thrift.routing.ThriftRouter
import com.twitter.ann.service.query_server.common.BaseQueryIndexServer

object QueryIndexServerMain extends QueryIndexServer

class QueryIndexServer extends BaseQueryIndexServer {

  override protected def additionalModules: Seq[Module] = Seq(new MyModule)

  override protected def addController(router: ThriftRouter): Unit = {
    router.add[MyController]
  }
}

class MyModule extends Module {
  // Guice bindings go here
}

class MyController extends AnnQueryService.MethodPerEndpoint {
  // Controller implementation goes here
}
```

In this example, a new `QueryIndexServer` class is defined that extends `BaseQueryIndexServer`. The `additionalModules` method is overridden to include a new Guice module called `MyModule`. The `addController` method is overridden to add a new controller called `MyController` to the Thrift router. Finally, the `MyController` class implements the `AnnQueryService.MethodPerEndpoint` interface, which defines the methods that the controller will handle.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code provides configuration for logging, stats, deciders, and controllers for a ThriftServer used in the Twitter Algorithm project.

2. What additional modules can be added to Guice and how are they added?
- Additional modules can be added to Guice by overriding the `additionalModules` method in this class and returning a sequence of modules. They will be included in the `modules` sequence along with `DeciderModule` and `MtlsThriftWebFormsModule`.

3. What filters are applied to the ThriftRouter and what do they do?
- The filters applied to the ThriftRouter are `LoggingMDCFilter`, `TraceIdMDCFilter`, `ThriftMDCFilter`, `AccessLoggingFilter`, and `StatsFilter`. They provide various logging and tracing functionality for the server.
