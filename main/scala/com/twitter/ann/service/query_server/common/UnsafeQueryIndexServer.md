The `UnsafeQueryIndexServer` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used when the generic parameters of the server are not known at compile time. This class is extended when the user wants to have id, distance, and runtime parameters as command-line options. 

The class has several flags that can be set as command-line options. These flags include the metric name, type of ids to use, size of thread pool for concurrent querying, dimension, index directory, refreshable, refreshable index update interval, sharded, how many shards load at once, how many indexes backwards to watch, interval at which HDFS is watched for changes, min index size in bytes, max index size in bytes, if indexes are grouped, and if dynamically reducing search complexity when cgroups container is throttled is enabled. 

The class also has a `terminationTimeoutMs` variable that is used to wait for the executor to finish before terminating the JVM. The `executor` variable is a thread pool executor that is used to execute queries concurrently. 

The `unsafeMetric` variable is a metric that is used to measure the distance between two vectors. The `unsafeQueryableMap` variable is a queryable map that is used to store the vectors. The `runtimeInjection` variable is an injection that is used to inject the runtime parameters. 

The `idInjection` method returns an injection that is used to inject the ids. The type of injection returned depends on the type of ids specified in the `id_type` flag. If the `id_type` flag is set to "string", the `StringInjection` is returned. If the `id_type` flag is set to "long", the `LongInjection` is returned. If the `id_type` flag is set to "int", the `IntInjection` is returned. If the `id_type` flag is set to any other value, the `byteInjection` for the specified entity kind is returned. 

Overall, the `UnsafeQueryIndexServer` class provides a way to create a query server with customizable options for the user. The class can be extended to provide compile-time checks for the parameters and to add additional functionality to the query server.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines an abstract class called `UnsafeQueryIndexServer` which is used when the generic parameters of the server are not known at compile time. It sets up various flags and options for the server, including thread pool size, index directory, and refreshable index settings.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several libraries including `com.google.common.util.concurrent`, `com.google.inject`, `com.twitter.ann.common`, `com.twitter.ann.common.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.app`, `com.twitter.bijection`, `com.twitter.cortex.ml.embeddings.common`, and `com.twitter.finatra.thrift.routing`.

3. What is the purpose of the `unsafeQueryableMap` and `runtimeInjection` methods?
- The `unsafeQueryableMap` method returns a `Queryable` object that can be used to query the server's index. The `runtimeInjection` method returns an `Injection` object that can be used to convert the server's runtime parameters to a Thrift `ServiceRuntimeParams` object.
