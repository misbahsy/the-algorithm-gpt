The code defines a ThrottlingInstrument trait and a WindowedThrottlingInstrument class that implements it. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to measure the amount of time spent throttling a process in a containerized environment. 

The ThrottlingInstrument trait defines three methods: sample(), percentageOfTimeSpentThrottling(), and disabled. The sample() method takes a measurement of the current throttling state and adds it to a history of measurements. The percentageOfTimeSpentThrottling() method calculates the percentage of time spent throttling over a given window of time. The disabled method returns a boolean indicating whether or not the container has a limit on CPU usage.

The WindowedThrottlingInstrument class extends the ThrottlingInstrument trait and takes in a stepFrequency, windowLengthInFrequencySteps, and a reader object. The stepFrequency is the frequency at which measurements are taken, the windowLengthInFrequencySteps is the length of the window over which measurements are aggregated, and the reader object is used to read CPU stats from the container. 

The class initializes a WindowedStats object to store the history of measurements, calculates the allotted CPU time per step, and initializes a variable to store the previous throttled time. The disabled method checks if the container has a CPU limit and returns a boolean accordingly. The sample() method takes a measurement of the current throttling state and adds it to the history of measurements. The percentageOfTimeSpentThrottling() method calculates the percentage of time spent throttling over the window of time and returns it as a double.

This code can be used in a larger project to monitor the throttling state of a containerized process and take action if the percentage of time spent throttling exceeds a certain threshold. For example, if the percentage of time spent throttling exceeds 50%, the process could be restarted or scaled up to handle the load. 

Example usage:

```
val instrument = new WindowedThrottlingInstrument(Duration.fromSeconds(1), 10, new AuroraCPUStatsReader())
instrument.sample()
val percentage = instrument.percentageOfTimeSpentThrottling()
if (percentage > 0.5) {
  // take action to handle high throttling percentage
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a trait and a class for throttling instrumentation, which is likely used to monitor and control the rate of requests or other actions in the larger project.

2. What is the significance of the `WindowedStats` object and how is it used?
- The `WindowedStats` object is used to track the history of throttling changes over a specified window length. It is used to calculate the percentage of time spent throttling in the `percentageOfTimeSpentThrottling()` method.

3. What is the `AuroraCPUStatsReader` and how is it used in this code?
- The `AuroraCPUStatsReader` is an external dependency that provides information about CPU usage and throttling. It is used to calculate the total number of allotted CPU time per step and to sample the amount of time spent throttling in the `sampleThrottling()` method.
