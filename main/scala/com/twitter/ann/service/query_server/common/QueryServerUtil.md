The `QueryServerUtil` object in the `com.twitter.ann.service.query_server.common` package provides a method for validating the size of a directory containing index files. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the directory size is within certain limits, which are specified as parameters to the `isValidIndexDirSize` method. This method takes an `AbstractFile` object representing the directory to be validated, as well as two `Long` values representing the minimum and maximum size of the directory in bytes.

The method first sets a boolean variable `recursive` to `true`, indicating that the directory should be searched recursively to find all files and subdirectories. It then uses the `listFiles` method of the `AbstractFile` object to obtain a list of all files and subdirectories in the directory, and converts this list to a Scala sequence using the `asScala` method. For each file in the sequence, the `getSizeInBytes` method is called to obtain its size in bytes, and these sizes are summed to obtain the total size of the directory.

The method then logs a debug message indicating the path of the directory and its size in bytes. Finally, the method checks whether the directory size is within the specified limits, and returns `true` if it is, or `false` otherwise. If the directory size is not within the limits, the method logs an info message indicating that the directory is invalid.

This code may be used in the larger project to ensure that index directories are of an appropriate size before they are used for searching. For example, if the minimum size is set to 1GB and the maximum size is set to 10GB, the `isValidIndexDirSize` method can be called to check whether a directory meets these requirements before it is used for searching. If the directory is too small or too large, the method will return `false` and an error message will be logged. This can help to prevent errors and improve the efficiency of the search process. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.ann.service.query_server.common.QueryServerUtil
import com.twitter.search.common.file.LocalFile

val indexDir = new LocalFile("/path/to/index/dir")
val minSize = 1073741824L // 1GB
val maxSize = 10737418240L // 10GB

val isValid = QueryServerUtil.isValidIndexDirSize(indexDir, minSize, maxSize)
if (isValid) {
  // use index directory for searching
} else {
  // handle error
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a utility function for validating the size of a directory in bytes.

2. What parameters does the `isValidIndexDirSize` function take?
- The `isValidIndexDirSize` function takes in an `AbstractFile` object representing the directory to be validated, a `Long` value for the minimum size of the directory in bytes (exclusive), and a `Long` value for the maximum size of the directory in bytes (exclusive).

3. What does the `isValidIndexDirSize` function return?
- The `isValidIndexDirSize` function returns a `Boolean` value indicating whether the directory size is within the defined limits.
