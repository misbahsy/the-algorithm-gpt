The `AuroraCPUStatsReader` class is responsible for reading CPU statistics from the CgroupsCpu object. This class is used for throttling purposes in the larger project. 

The `throttledTimeNanos` method returns an optional Long value representing the amount of time in nanoseconds that the CPU has been throttled. If the CPU has not been throttled, the method returns None. This method is useful for monitoring CPU usage and detecting when the CPU is being throttled.

The `cpuQuota` method reads the assigned CPU number from Mesos files and returns a Double value representing the number of CPUs (which can be fractional). If the file read fails or it's not a valid Mesos environment, the method returns -1.0. This method is useful for determining the CPU quota and for calculating the CPU usage percentage.

Here is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:

```scala
val cpuStatsReader = new AuroraCPUStatsReader()
val throttledTime = cpuStatsReader.throttledTimeNanos()
val cpuQuota = cpuStatsReader.cpuQuota

if (throttledTime.isDefined) {
  println(s"CPU has been throttled for ${throttledTime.get} nanoseconds")
}

if (cpuQuota >= 0) {
  val cpuUsage = calculateCpuUsage() // some function that calculates CPU usage percentage
  println(s"CPU usage: $cpuUsage%")
}
``` 

Overall, the `AuroraCPUStatsReader` class provides a way to read CPU statistics and calculate CPU usage and quota, which is important for throttling purposes in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a class called AuroraCPUStatsReader that reads CPU statistics from a CgroupsCpu object. It is likely used in a larger project related to throttling CPU usage.
2. What is the significance of the returned values in the cpuQuota method?
- The cpuQuota method returns a positive number representing the number of CPUs assigned to the process, or -1 if the file read failed or it's not a valid Mesos environment.
3. What is the purpose of the Option wrapper around the returned value in the throttledTimeNanos method?
- The Option wrapper indicates that the returned value may be null, and provides a way to handle that possibility in a safe and concise way.
