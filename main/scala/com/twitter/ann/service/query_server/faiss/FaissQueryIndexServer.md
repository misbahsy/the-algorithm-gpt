The code defines a server for querying Faiss indexes. Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. The server provides a way to load Faiss indexes from a directory and query them. The server can handle both simple indexes and sharded indexes. A simple index is a single file that contains the entire index. A sharded index is split into hourly shards, where each shard is a separate file. The server can watch the directory for changes and reload the index if it changes. The server can also throttle queries based on a quality factor. The quality factor is a measure of how well the index is performing. If the quality factor is low, the server will reduce the number of queries it processes to avoid overloading the index. The server also provides a warmup function that runs a set of queries against the index to ensure that it is loaded into memory before it is used.

Example usage:

```scala
val server = FaissQueryIndexServer
server.indexDirectory = "/path/to/index"
server.refreshable = true
server.refreshableInterval = 10 // minutes
server.qualityFactorEnabled = true
server.start()
val query = Array(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
val results = server.query(query, 10)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FaissQueryIndexServer` object and how is it related to the `FaissQueryableServer` class?
- The `FaissQueryIndexServer` object is a singleton instance of the `FaissQueryableServer` class, which is used to provide a queryable index from a directory. 

2. What is the difference between a simple queryable and a sharded queryable, and how are they built?
- A simple queryable is built by loading the index from a directory, while a sharded queryable is built by loading hourly sharded indexes from a directory. The difference is that a sharded queryable allows for more efficient updates to the index. 

3. What is the purpose of the `FaissWarmup` class and how is it used?
- The `FaissWarmup` class is used to warm up the queryable index by running a query with a random query vector and measuring the response time. This is done to ensure that the index is fully loaded and ready to respond to queries.
