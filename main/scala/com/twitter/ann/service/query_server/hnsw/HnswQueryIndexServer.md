[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/ann/src/main/scala/com/twitter/ann/service/query_server/hnsw/HnswQueryIndexServer.scala)

The code defines a query server for a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index. The HNSW index is a data structure used for nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The server is designed to load an HNSW index from a directory and provide a queryable interface for searching the index. 

The `HnswQueryableServer` class extends `UnsafeQueryIndexServer` and overrides its methods to define how to load an HNSW index from a directory and how to create a queryable interface for the index. The `queryableProvider` method defines how to load an HNSW index from a directory and return a `Queryable` object that can be used to query the index. The `buildQueryable` method creates a `Queryable` object for the index, either as a refreshable or non-refreshable queryable, depending on the configuration. The `unsafeQueryableMap` method returns the `Queryable` object for the index.

The `HNSWWarmup` class is used to warm up the HNSW index by running a query with a random query vector. The `warmup` method runs the query and logs the result. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a query server for an HNSW index that can be used to search for nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces. The server can be configured to load an index from a directory and provide a queryable interface for the index. The `HNSWWarmup` class is used to warm up the index before it is used for querying. 

Example usage:

```
val server = new HnswQueryableServer()
server.setIndexDirectory("/path/to/index")
server.setDimension(128)
server.setUnsafeMetric(new EuclideanDistance())
val queryable = server.unsafeQueryableMap[Array[Float], EuclideanDistance]()
val queryVector = Array.fill(128)(Random.nextFloat())
val results = queryable.queryWithDistance(queryVector, 10, HnswParams(ef = 800))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HnswQueryableServer` class?
- The `HnswQueryableServer` class is a query index server that provides a way to load a directory as a queryable index.

2. What is the `HNSWWarmup` class used for?
- The `HNSWWarmup` class is used to warm up the queryable index by running a query with distance and ensuring that it returns successful results.

3. What is the significance of the `IndexGroupPrefix` variable?
- The `IndexGroupPrefix` variable is used as a prefix for the name of the index group when building a queryable index.
