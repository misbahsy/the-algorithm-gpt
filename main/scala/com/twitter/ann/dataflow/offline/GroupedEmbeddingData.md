The code defines a case class called GroupedEmbeddingData that extends another class called BaseEmbeddingData. The purpose of this class is to represent embedding data that has been grouped by a certain identifier, which can be either a Long or a String. The embedding data itself is represented as a sequence of Doubles.

This class is likely used in the larger project to store and manipulate embedding data for various entities, such as users or tweets. By grouping the embedding data by entity ID or some other identifier, it becomes easier to perform operations on subsets of the data, such as calculating similarity scores between different entities.

Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```scala
val embeddingData = GroupedEmbeddingData(
  entityId = Some(12345),
  embedding = Seq(0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
  groupId = Some("user")
)

// Accessing the fields of the GroupedEmbeddingData instance
val entityId = embeddingData.entityId.get
val embedding = embeddingData.embedding
val groupId = embeddingData.groupId.get
```

In this example, we create a new instance of GroupedEmbeddingData with an entity ID of 12345, an embedding of [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], and a group ID of "user". We can then access the fields of this instance using the dot notation, as shown in the comments.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GroupedEmbeddingData` case class?
- The `GroupedEmbeddingData` case class is used to represent embedding data that has been grouped by a specific identifier, such as a group ID.

2. What is the significance of the `@SchemaFieldName` annotation on the class fields?
- The `@SchemaFieldName` annotation is used to specify the name of the field as it appears in the schema, which can be useful for serialization and deserialization.

3. What is the `BaseEmbeddingData` class that `GroupedEmbeddingData` extends?
- Without seeing the implementation of `BaseEmbeddingData`, it is unclear what functionality it provides to `GroupedEmbeddingData`.
