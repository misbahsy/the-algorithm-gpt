[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/ann/src/main/java/com/twitter/ann/faiss/swig/ReadOnlyInvertedLists.java)

The code defines a Java class called `ReadOnlyInvertedLists` that extends another class called `InvertedLists`. The purpose of this class is to provide read-only access to inverted lists, which are data structures used in the Faiss library for similarity search and clustering. 

The class has several methods that allow users to interact with the inverted lists. The `add_entries` method adds new entries to a specified list in the inverted index. It takes as input the list number, the number of entries to add, a vector of IDs for the entries, and a pointer to a block of memory containing the binary codes for the entries. The method returns the number of entries that were actually added to the list.

The `update_entries` method updates existing entries in a specified list. It takes as input the list number, the offset of the first entry to update, the number of entries to update, a vector of IDs for the entries, and a pointer to a block of memory containing the new binary codes for the entries.

The `resize` method resizes a specified list to a new size. It takes as input the list number and the new size.

All of these methods call native methods defined in the `swigfaissJNI` class, which is generated by SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) and provides a bridge between Java and the underlying C++ implementation of Faiss.

Overall, the `ReadOnlyInvertedLists` class provides a way for users to interact with inverted lists in a read-only manner, which is useful for scenarios where the index is being used for querying but not for updating. This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Faiss library to perform similarity search and clustering tasks. 

Example usage:

```
// Assume we have an existing Faiss index with inverted lists
Index index = new Index(dimension, "IVF100,SQ8");
index.train(trainingData);
index.add(data);

// Get the inverted lists as read-only
ReadOnlyInvertedLists invertedLists = index.getInvertedLists();

// Query the index using the inverted lists
long[] ids = new long[k];
float[] distances = new float[k];
index.search(query, k, distances, ids);

// Iterate over the inverted lists to get additional information
for (int i = 0; i < index.ntotal(); i++) {
  long[] listIds = invertedLists.get_ids(i);
  byte[] codes = invertedLists.get_codes(i);
  // Do something with the list IDs and codes
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a Java class called `ReadOnlyInvertedLists` that extends another class called `InvertedLists`. It contains methods for adding and updating entries, as well as resizing lists.

2. What is the source of this code and has it been modified?
   - The code was automatically generated by SWIG (http://www.swig.org) version 4.0.2. The comment at the top of the file warns against making changes to this file and instead modifying the SWIG interface file.

3. What are the parameters and return types of the methods in this class?
   - The `add_entries` method takes in a `long` list number, a `long` number of entries, a `LongVector` of IDs, and a `SWIGTYPE_p_unsigned_char` code, and returns a `long`. The `update_entries` method takes in a `long` list number, a `long` offset, a `long` number of entries, a `LongVector` of IDs, and a `SWIGTYPE_p_unsigned_char` code, and returns nothing. The `resize` method takes in a `long` list number and a `long` new size, and returns nothing.
