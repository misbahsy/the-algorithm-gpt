This file contains the implementation of the `IndexHNSW2Level` class, which is a subclass of the `IndexHNSW` class. The purpose of this class is to provide an implementation of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm with two levels of quantization. The HNSW algorithm is a method for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces, and it is particularly useful for large-scale search problems.

The `IndexHNSW2Level` class provides several constructors for creating an instance of the class. The first constructor creates an empty instance of the class, while the second constructor takes an `Index` object, the number of lists (`nlist`), the number of subquantizers (`m_pq`), and the number of neighbors to consider (`M`) as arguments. The `Index` object is used as the quantizer for the HNSW algorithm.

The `IndexHNSW2Level` class also provides two methods: `flip_to_ivf()` and `search()`. The `flip_to_ivf()` method is used to convert the HNSW index to an Inverted File (IVF) index. The `search()` method is used to perform a nearest neighbor search on the index. It takes the number of vectors to search (`n`), a pointer to the query vectors (`x`), the number of neighbors to return (`k`), a pointer to the array to store the distances of the neighbors (`distances`), and a `LongVector` object to store the labels of the neighbors as arguments.

Overall, the `IndexHNSW2Level` class provides an implementation of the HNSW algorithm with two levels of quantization, which can be used for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The class provides methods for creating an index, converting it to an IVF index, and performing a nearest neighbor search on the index.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a Java class called `IndexHNSW2Level` that extends another class called `IndexHNSW`. It contains methods for creating and manipulating objects of this class, including a constructor, a method for flipping to an inverted file, and a method for searching for nearest neighbors.
   
2. What is the relationship between this code and SWIG?
   - This code was automatically generated by SWIG, a tool for connecting C/C++ code with other programming languages. The comments at the top of the file indicate that this code should not be modified directly, but rather the SWIG interface file should be modified instead.
   
3. What are the parameters and return types of the `search` method?
   - The `search` method takes in a long `n`, a pointer to a float array `x`, a long `k`, a pointer to a float array `distances`, and a `LongVector` object called `labels`. It does not return anything.
