This code defines an enum class called MetricType that represents different distance metrics used in Faiss, a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. The class contains eight static instances of MetricType, each representing a different metric. The metrics include inner product, L2, L1, Linf, Lp, Canberra, Bray-Curtis, and Jensen-Shannon. 

The MetricType class provides methods to convert between the enum values and their corresponding integer values used in the Faiss library. The swigValue() method returns the integer value of the enum, while the swigToEnum() method takes an integer value and returns the corresponding MetricType enum. The toString() method returns the name of the enum as a string.

This class is likely used in other parts of the Faiss library to specify the distance metric to be used in similarity search and clustering algorithms. For example, in the IndexIVFFlat class, the constructor takes a MetricType parameter to specify the distance metric to be used. 

Example usage:

```
// create an instance of IndexIVFFlat with L2 distance metric
IndexIVFFlat index = new IndexIVFFlat(d, nlist, MetricType.METRIC_L2);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called MetricType that contains constants representing different types of distance metrics used in Faiss, a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

2. What is SWIG and how is it related to this code?
- SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C/C++ with scripting languages such as Java. This code was automatically generated by SWIG based on an interface file that describes the C++ functions and data structures used in Faiss.

3. What is the significance of the swigValue and swigName fields in the MetricType class?
- The swigValue field represents the integer value associated with each constant, which is used internally by Faiss to identify the corresponding distance metric. The swigName field is a string that provides a human-readable name for each constant, which is used for debugging and error reporting purposes.
