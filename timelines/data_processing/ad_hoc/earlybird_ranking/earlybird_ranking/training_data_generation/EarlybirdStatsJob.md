The `EarlybirdStatsJob` object is a Scala script that computes counts and fractions for all labels in a Recap data source. The purpose of this script is to generate statistics about the data that will be used to train a machine learning model. The script takes two arguments: `--input`, which is the path to the Recap data source, and `--output`, which is the path to the output JSON file containing the computed statistics.

The script uses several libraries and APIs, including `com.twitter.ml.api`, `com.twitter.scalding`, and `scala.collection.JavaConverters`. The `DataSetAnalyticsPlugin` and `FDsl` libraries are used to perform analytics on the data, while the `DailySuffixFeatureSource` library is used to read the data from the input path. The `TypedJson` library is used to write the computed statistics to the output JSON file.

The `EarlybirdStatsJob` object defines several helper methods, including `addGlobalEngagementLabel` and `labelFeatureMatcher`. The `addGlobalEngagementLabel` method adds a feature to each data record indicating whether the record has any of the labels specified in the `constants.LabelInfos` list. The `labelFeatureMatcher` method creates a feature matcher that matches all labels in the `constants.LabelInfos` list and the `IS_EARLYBIRD_UNIFIED_ENGAGEMENT` feature.

The `computeStats` method is the main method that computes the statistics for the data. It takes a `DataSetPipe` object as input, which is the data read from the input path. The method first calls the `addGlobalEngagementLabel` method on each data record to add the global engagement label feature. It then projects the data onto the label feature matcher using the `project` method and collects the feature statistics using the `collectFeatureStats` method.

The `job` method is the entry point for the script. It first gets the command line arguments using the `Execution.getArgs` method and the date range using the `dateRangeEx` method. It then reads the data from the input path using the `DailySuffixFeatureSource` library and calls the `computeStats` method to compute the statistics. Finally, it writes the computed statistics to the output JSON file using the `TypedJson` library.

Overall, the `EarlybirdStatsJob` object is an important component of the larger project that generates training data for a machine learning model. It computes statistics about the data that will be used to train the model and writes the statistics to a JSON file. The statistics can be used to analyze the data and improve the accuracy of the machine learning model.
