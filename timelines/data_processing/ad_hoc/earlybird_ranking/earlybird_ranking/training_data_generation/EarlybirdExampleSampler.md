The `EarlybirdExampleSampler` class is used to generate training data for a machine learning model that predicts whether a tweet will have global engagement or not. It takes in a `DataSetPipe` object, which contains a set of records, and adds an `IsGlobalEngagement` label to records that contain any recap label. It also adds an "importance" value per recap label found in the record. The `IsGlobalEngagement` label is set to `true` if any recap label is present in the record. The `importance` value is calculated by dividing the `importance` of the label by the `downsampleFraction` of the label. 

The `weightAndSample` method is used to perform the above operations. It first filters the `labelInfos` list to get all the labels that are present in the record. If any labels are present, it samples them based on their `downsampleFraction` and calculates the `importance` value for each sampled label. It then sets the `IsGlobalEngagement` label to `true` and returns the record with the `ImportanceFeature` set to the sum of the `importance` values of the sampled labels. If no labels are present or none of the labels are sampled, it returns `None`. If the record does not contain any recap labels, it samples the `negativeInfo` label based on its `downsampleFraction` and returns the record with the `ImportanceFeature` set to the `importance` value of the `negativeInfo` label. 

The `ImportanceFeature` is a feature that is used to store the `importance` value of the labels. It is created using the `SharedFeatures.RECORD_WEIGHT_FEATURE_BUILDER` and is added to the `DataSetPipe` object along with the `RecapFeatures.IS_EARLYBIRD_UNIFIED_ENGAGEMENT` feature, which is set to `true` if the record contains any recap label. 

Overall, the `EarlybirdExampleSampler` class is used to generate training data for a machine learning model that predicts whether a tweet will have global engagement or not. It does this by adding an `IsGlobalEngagement` label to records that contain any recap label and setting the `ImportanceFeature` to the `importance` value of the labels. It also downsamples positive and negative examples based on provided downsample rates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is part of the Earlybird ranking training data generation process for the Twitter Timelines project. It adds a label to records containing a recap label and adjusts weights accordingly.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the com.twitter.ml.api and com.twitter.timelines.prediction.features.recap libraries.

3. What is the significance of the ImportanceFeature and how is it calculated?
- The ImportanceFeature is a feature that is added to records based on the number of recap labels found in the record. It is calculated by summing the importance values of the sampled labels and dividing by the downsample fraction of the label.
