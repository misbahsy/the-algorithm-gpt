The code above is a utility class called FeatureSwitchUtil that provides methods for creating instances of FeatureSwitches, which are used to enable or disable certain features in a larger project. 

The FeatureSwitches are created using the FeatureSwitchesBuilder class from the com.twitter.featureswitches.v2.builder package. The builder takes in a configuration path and a StatsReceiver object, which is used to collect metrics on the usage of the feature switches. 

The mkVisibilityLibraryFeatureSwitches method creates a FeatureSwitches instance for the main visibility library feature set. It takes in an ABDecider object, which is used to decide which version of the feature to use based on the configured experiment percentages. The method then calls the createDefault method on the FeatureSwitchesBuilder object, passing in the LibraryFeaturesConfigPath, the ABDecider, and the StatsReceiver. This creates a FeatureSwitches instance with the default experiment configuration.

The mkLimitedActionsFeatureSwitches method creates a FeatureSwitches instance for a limited set of visibility actions. It takes in a StatsReceiver object and calls the createWithNoExperiments method on the FeatureSwitchesBuilder object, passing in the LimitedActionsFeaturesConfigPath and the StatsReceiver. This creates a FeatureSwitches instance with no experiments configured.

Overall, this code provides a way to create instances of FeatureSwitches for different feature sets in a larger project. These FeatureSwitches can then be used to enable or disable certain features based on experiment percentages or other criteria. For example, in a social media platform like Twitter, FeatureSwitches could be used to enable or disable certain features for different user groups or in different regions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code provides utility functions for creating feature switches related to visibility in Twitter's system. It allows for the creation of feature switches with different configurations and AB testing options.
2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
   - This code depends on several other packages, including `com.twitter.abdecider.ABDecider`, `com.twitter.featureswitches.v2.FeatureSwitches`, and `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`. These packages are used to create and configure the feature switches.
3. How can this code be integrated into a larger system or project?
   - To use this code in a larger system or project, the `FeatureSwitchUtil` object can be imported and its functions can be called with the appropriate arguments. The feature switches can then be used to control the visibility of different features or actions in the system.
