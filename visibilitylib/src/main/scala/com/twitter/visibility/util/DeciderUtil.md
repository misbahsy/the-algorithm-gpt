The `DeciderUtil` object in the `com.twitter.visibility.util` package provides utility methods for creating instances of `Decider` and `LoggingABDecider` classes. These classes are used for making decisions based on configuration files. 

The `mkDecider` method creates an instance of the `Decider` class. It takes three optional parameters: `deciderBasePath`, `deciderOverlayPath`, and `useLocalDeciderOverrides`. The `deciderBasePath` parameter specifies the path to the base configuration file for the `Decider`. The `deciderOverlayPath` parameter specifies the path to an overlay configuration file that can be used to override the base configuration. The `useLocalDeciderOverrides` parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether to use local overrides for the `Decider`. If `useLocalDeciderOverrides` is `true`, the method returns a `Decider` instance that includes local overrides. Otherwise, it returns a `Decider` instance that uses only the base and overlay configuration files.

The `mkLocalDecider` method is a convenience method that creates a `Decider` instance using only the base configuration file. It calls the `mkDecider` method with `deciderOverlayPath` set to `None`.

The `mkABDecider` method creates an instance of the `LoggingABDecider` class. It takes two optional parameters: `scribeLogger` and `abDeciderPath`. The `scribeLogger` parameter specifies a logger to use for logging decisions made by the `LoggingABDecider`. The `abDeciderPath` parameter specifies the path to the configuration file for the `LoggingABDecider`. The method returns a `LoggingABDecider` instance that logs decisions made by the `ABDecider` class.

These utility methods can be used in the larger project to create instances of `Decider` and `LoggingABDecider` classes for making decisions based on configuration files. For example, the `mkDecider` method can be used to create a `Decider` instance that determines whether a tweet should be visible to a user based on the user's settings. The `mkABDecider` method can be used to create a `LoggingABDecider` instance that determines which version of a feature to show to a user based on the user's location and other factors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code provides utility functions for creating deciders and AB deciders, which are used for making decisions based on configuration files. It solves the problem of needing to create these objects in multiple places throughout the codebase.

2. What are the default paths for the decider and AB decider configuration files? 
- The default path for the decider configuration file is "/config/com/twitter/visibility/decider.yml". The default path for the AB decider configuration file is "/usr/local/config/abdecider/abdecider.yml".

3. What is the purpose of the `mkLocalDecider` function? 
- The `mkLocalDecider` function creates a decider object using the default decider configuration file and no overlay file. This is useful for creating a decider that is not affected by any local overrides.
