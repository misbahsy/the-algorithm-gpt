This code defines a model for handling safety labels on tweets in the "The Algorithm from Twitter" project. The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to classify tweets based on their content and apply appropriate safety labels to them. This helps in filtering and managing content on the platform, ensuring that users are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content.

The `TweetSafetyLabelType` sealed trait represents the different types of safety labels that can be applied to a tweet. It includes various categories such as Abusive, Spam, LowQuality, and more. The `TweetSafetyLabel` case class holds information about a specific safety label applied to a tweet, including the label type, source, applicable users, model metadata, score, and safety label source.

The `TweetSafetyLabelType` object provides methods for converting between the internal model representation and the Thrift representation used for communication between services. It also defines a list of active labels and deprecated labels, which can be used to filter out deprecated labels when processing tweets.

The `TweetSafetyLabel` object provides methods for converting between the internal model representation and the Thrift representation of a `TweetSafetyLabel`. This allows for easy serialization and deserialization of the safety label data when communicating between services.

Here's an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val tweetSafetyLabel = TweetSafetyLabel(
  labelType = TweetSafetyLabelType.Spam,
  source = Some(LabelSource.User),
  applicableUsers = Set(12345L),
  score = Some(0.8)
)

val thriftSafetyLabel = TweetSafetyLabel.toThrift(tweetSafetyLabel)
val deserializedSafetyLabel = TweetSafetyLabel.fromThrift(thriftSafetyLabel)
```

In this example, a `TweetSafetyLabel` is created with the label type "Spam" and a source of "User". The label is then converted to its Thrift representation and back to the internal model representation.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetSafetyLabelType` object and its associated case objects?
   **Answer**: The `TweetSafetyLabelType` object represents different types of safety labels that can be applied to tweets. The associated case objects define specific safety label types, such as `Abusive`, `Spam`, `LowQuality`, etc.

2. **Question**: How does the code handle the conversion between Thrift and model representations of safety labels?
   **Answer**: The code provides `fromThrift` and `toThrift` methods in the `TweetSafetyLabel` object and `TweetSafetyLabelType` object. These methods handle the conversion between Thrift and model representations of safety labels and their types.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetSafetyLabel` case class and its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `TweetSafetyLabel` case class represents a safety label applied to a tweet. Its parameters include the label type, source, applicable users, model metadata, score, and safety label source, which provide information about the label and how it was determined.
