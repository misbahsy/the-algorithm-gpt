This code is part of a project that deals with managing the visibility and safety levels of various features and components within a Twitter-like application. The code is organized into a package called `com.twitter.visibility.models` and primarily consists of a sealed trait `SafetyLevelGroup` and its companion object.

The `SafetyLevelGroup` trait represents a group of safety levels, with each group containing a set of `SafetyLevel` objects. These safety levels are used to control the visibility and access to various features and components within the application, such as Ads, Articles, Birdwatch, Cards, Conversations, Direct Messages, Notifications, Search, Spaces, and Timelines.

The companion object `SafetyLevelGroup` defines multiple case objects, each representing a specific group of safety levels. For example, the `Ads` case object contains safety levels related to advertising features, while the `ArticleTimeline` case object contains safety levels related to article timelines. Each case object has a `levels` property, which is a set of `SafetyLevel` objects associated with that group.

This code can be used in the larger project to manage and control access to various features and components based on the safety levels assigned to users or content. For example, certain features might be restricted to users with a specific safety level, or content might be filtered based on the safety level of the user viewing it.

Here's an example of how this code might be used:

```scala
val userSafetyLevel: SafetyLevel = getUserSafetyLevel(user)
val featureSafetyLevelGroup: SafetyLevelGroup = SafetyLevelGroup.Ads

if (featureSafetyLevelGroup.levels.contains(userSafetyLevel)) {
  // User has access to the Ads feature
} else {
  // User does not have access to the Ads feature
}
```

In this example, the user's safety level is checked against the safety levels in the `Ads` group to determine if they have access to the advertising features.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SafetyLevel` and `SafetyLevelGroup` in this code?
   **Answer:** The `SafetyLevel` represents different safety levels for various features and functionalities in the Twitter algorithm, while `SafetyLevelGroup` groups these safety levels into categories, making it easier to manage and understand the safety levels for different aspects of the application.

2. **Question:** How are the safety levels used in the application, and how do they affect the functionality?
   **Answer:** The safety levels are used to control access and visibility of certain features and functionalities within the application. Depending on the safety level assigned to a user or a feature, it can restrict or allow access to specific parts of the application, ensuring a safe and controlled environment for users.

3. **Question:** How can a new safety level be added to the existing list of safety levels?
   **Answer:** To add a new safety level, you would first define it in the `SafetyLevel` enumeration, and then add it to the appropriate `SafetyLevelGroup` by including it in the `levels` set of the corresponding group.
