The code defines a sealed trait called `ViolationLevel` and its corresponding case objects. The `ViolationLevel` trait is extended by five case objects, each of which has a unique `level` value. The `ViolationLevel` trait and its case objects are used to represent the severity level of a violation in a tweet.

The `TweetSafetyLabelType` is an enumeration that represents the type of safety label that can be applied to a tweet. The `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` is a private `Map` that maps a `TweetSafetyLabelType` to a `ViolationLevel`. The `violationLevelToSafetyLabels` is a public `Map` that maps a `ViolationLevel` to a set of `TweetSafetyLabelType`. These maps are used to convert between `TweetSafetyLabelType` and `ViolationLevel`.

The `fromTweetSafetyLabel` method takes a `TweetSafetyLabel` object and returns the corresponding `ViolationLevel` object. If the `TweetSafetyLabel` object is not found in the `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` map, the `DefaultLevel` object is returned. The `fromTweetSafetyLabelOpt` method is similar to `fromTweetSafetyLabel`, but it returns an `Option[ViolationLevel]` instead of a `ViolationLevel`. If the `TweetSafetyLabel` object is not found in the `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` map, `None` is returned.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves analyzing tweets for safety violations. The `ViolationLevel` objects can be used to categorize tweets based on their severity level, and the `TweetSafetyLabelType` objects can be used to identify the type of safety violation in a tweet. The `fromTweetSafetyLabel` and `fromTweetSafetyLabelOpt` methods can be used to convert between `TweetSafetyLabel` and `ViolationLevel` objects. Overall, this code provides a useful framework for analyzing tweets for safety violations and categorizing them based on their severity level.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ViolationLevel` trait and its subclasses?
- The `ViolationLevel` trait and its subclasses define different levels of violation for tweet safety labels.

2. What is the significance of the `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` and `violationLevelToSafetyLabels` maps?
- The `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` map maps tweet safety label types to their corresponding violation levels.
- The `violationLevelToSafetyLabels` map maps violation levels to the set of tweet safety label types that correspond to that level.

3. What do the `fromTweetSafetyLabel` and `fromTweetSafetyLabelOpt` methods do?
- The `fromTweetSafetyLabel` method returns the violation level corresponding to a given tweet safety label, or the default level if the label is not found in the `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` map.
- The `fromTweetSafetyLabelOpt` method returns an `Option` of the violation level corresponding to a given tweet safety label, or `None` if the label is not found in the `safetyLabelToViolationLevel` map.
