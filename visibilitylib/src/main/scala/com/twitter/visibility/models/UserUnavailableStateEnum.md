[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/visibilitylib/src/main/scala/com/twitter/visibility/models/UserUnavailableStateEnum.scala)

This code defines a sealed trait called `UserUnavailableStateEnum` and its corresponding object. The trait represents the various states in which a user may be unavailable on Twitter. The object contains case objects and a case class that extend the trait and represent specific states.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing user unavailability states within the larger project. This allows for easier handling and processing of user data based on their availability status. For example, other parts of the project may use this code to determine whether a user's content should be displayed or hidden based on their unavailability state.

Here is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:

```scala
import com.twitter.visibility.models.UserUnavailableStateEnum._

val userState: UserUnavailableStateEnum = Suspended

if (userState == Suspended) {
  // hide user's content
} else {
  // display user's content
}
```

In this example, the `UserUnavailableStateEnum` object is imported and the `Suspended` case object is assigned to a variable representing a user's unavailability state. The code then checks if the user is suspended and decides whether to display or hide their content accordingly.

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for managing user data within the larger project and ensures consistency in how user unavailability states are represented and handled.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a sealed trait and its corresponding object that represent different states of user unavailability. It is likely used in other parts of the project that deal with user visibility and access control.

2. What is the significance of the lazy val `name` in the `UserUnavailableStateEnum` trait?
- The `name` property is used to get a human-readable name for each state, which is generated using the `NamingUtils` utility class. By making it a lazy val, the name is only computed when it is first accessed, which can save computation time if the name is never needed.

3. What is the purpose of the `Filtered` case class and how is it used?
- The `Filtered` case class represents a state where a user is unavailable due to a filtering action, and includes a `UserVisibilityResult` object that provides more information about the filtering. It is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the project that deal with filtering and user visibility.
