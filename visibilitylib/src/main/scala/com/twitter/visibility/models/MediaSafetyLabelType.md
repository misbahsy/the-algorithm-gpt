The code defines a set of safety labels for media content on Twitter. It includes a sealed trait `MediaSafetyLabelType` that extends `SafetyLabelType` and defines a set of case objects that represent different types of safety labels. The `MediaSafetyLabelType` objects are used to classify media content on Twitter based on its safety level. 

The `MediaSafetyLabelType` object has a companion object that defines a set of methods and properties. The `List` property is a list of all `MediaSafetyLabelType` objects, while the `ActiveLabels` property is a list of all `MediaSafetyLabelType` objects except for `Unknown` and `Deprecated`. The `fromName` method takes a string and returns an `Option[MediaSafetyLabelType]` based on the name of the label. The `fromThrift` method takes a `s.MediaSafetyLabelType` object and returns the corresponding `MediaSafetyLabelType` object. The `toThrift` method takes a `MediaSafetyLabelType` object and returns the corresponding `s.MediaSafetyLabelType` object.

The `MediaSafetyLabelType` objects are used in other parts of the project to classify media content based on its safety level. For example, the safety label of a media content can be retrieved using the `fromThrift` method and used to determine whether the content should be flagged or removed. The `toThrift` method can be used to convert a `MediaSafetyLabelType` object to a `s.MediaSafetyLabelType` object, which can be used in other parts of the project that require the Thrift representation of the safety label.

Example usage:

```
val label = MediaSafetyLabelType.fromName("NsfwHighPrecision")
// label is Some(NsfwHighPrecision)

val thriftLabel = MediaSafetyLabelType.toThrift(NsfwHighPrecision)
// thriftLabel is s.MediaSafetyLabelType.NsfwHighPrecision
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a set of safety labels for media content on Twitter.

2. What is the relationship between `MediaSafetyLabelType` and `SafetyLabelType`?
- `MediaSafetyLabelType` is a subtype of `SafetyLabelType`.

3. What is the significance of the `ActiveLabels` value in this code?
- `ActiveLabels` is a list of `MediaSafetyLabelType` values that are considered active and not deprecated or unknown.
