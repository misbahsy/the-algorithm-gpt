The code above defines a case class called `UserAge` that represents the age of a user. The age is stored as an optional integer value, which means that it can be either a valid integer or None. The purpose of this class is to provide methods that allow checking whether a user has an age, whether their age is greater than or equal to a given value, and to extract the age value from an instance of the `UserAge` class.

The `hasAge` method returns a Boolean value indicating whether the `ageInYears` field is defined or not. If it is defined, then the user has an age, and the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The `isGte` method takes an integer value as an argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the `ageInYears` field is defined and greater than or equal to the given value. It does this by using the `collectFirst` method on the `ageInYears` field, which allows pattern matching on an optional value. If the `ageInYears` field is defined and greater than the given value, then the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The `unapply` method is a special method that is used for pattern matching. It takes an instance of the `UserAge` class as an argument and returns an optional integer value representing the age. This method is used to extract the age value from an instance of the `UserAge` class when pattern matching on it.

Overall, this code provides a simple way to represent and manipulate user ages in the larger project. It allows checking whether a user has an age, whether their age is greater than or equal to a given value, and to extract the age value from an instance of the `UserAge` class. This can be useful in various parts of the project, such as filtering users based on their age or displaying their age in a user profile. 

Example usage:

```scala
val userAge = UserAge(Some(25))
if (userAge.hasAge && userAge.isGte(18)) {
  println("User is an adult")
} else {
  println("User is not an adult")
}

val UserAge(age) = userAge
println(s"User age is $age")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the UserAge case class?
   - The UserAge case class is used to represent the age of a user, with an optional integer value for the age in years.

2. What does the hasAge method do?
   - The hasAge method returns a boolean value indicating whether the ageInYears field of the UserAge instance is defined or not.

3. What is the purpose of the unapply method?
   - The unapply method is used for pattern matching, allowing the ageInYears field of a UserAge instance to be extracted as an Option[Int].
