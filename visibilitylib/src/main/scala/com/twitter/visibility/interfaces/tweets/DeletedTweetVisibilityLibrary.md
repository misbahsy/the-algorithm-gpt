The `DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary` object is a Scala code module that provides a type and a function for handling the visibility of deleted tweets on Twitter. The purpose of this code is to determine the visibility of a tweet that has been deleted by its author or by Twitter. The module uses several other libraries and modules to achieve this goal.

The `DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary` object contains a type called `Type` and a case class called `Request`. The `Type` type is a function that takes a `Request` object and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object. The `Request` case class contains several parameters that are used to determine the visibility of a deleted tweet. These parameters include the ID of the deleted tweet, the safety level of the viewer, the viewer context, the reason for the tweet's deletion, and whether the tweet is a retweet or an inner quoted tweet.

The `apply` function is the main function of the `DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary` object. It takes three parameters: a `VisibilityLibrary` object, a `Decider` object, and a `TombstoneGenerator` object. The `VisibilityLibrary` object is used to run the rule engine that determines the visibility of the deleted tweet. The `Decider` object is used to decide whether a tweet should be visible or not based on the safety level of the viewer. The `TombstoneGenerator` object is used to generate a tombstone message that is displayed in place of the deleted tweet.

The `apply` function returns a function that takes a `Request` object and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object. This function increments a counter that tracks the number of requests made to the visibility engine. It then creates a `ContentId` object using the ID of the deleted tweet. It also gets the language code of the viewer context, defaulting to "en" if it is not available. It then builds a feature map using the `VisibilityLibrary` object and the `TweetIsInnerQuotedTweet`, `TweetIsRetweet`, and `TweetDeleteReason` features. Finally, it runs the rule engine using the `VisibilityLibrary` object, the feature map, the viewer context, and the safety level. It then maps the result to a tombstone message using the `TombstoneGenerator` object and returns the result.

Overall, the `DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary` object provides a way to determine the visibility of deleted tweets on Twitter. It uses several other libraries and modules to achieve this goal and provides a simple interface for developers to use. Here is an example of how to use this module:

```
val visibilityLibrary = new VisibilityLibrary()
val decider = new Decider()
val tombstoneGenerator = new TombstoneGenerator()

val deletedTweetVisibility = DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary(visibilityLibrary, decider, tombstoneGenerator)

val request = DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary.Request(
  tweetId = 123456789,
  safetyLevel = SafetyLevel.Safe,
  viewerContext = ViewerContext(),
  tweetDeleteReason = TweetDeleteReason.ViolationOfTermsOfService,
  isRetweet = false,
  isInnerQuotedTweet = false
)

val result = deletedTweetVisibility(request).run()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an object called `DeletedTweetVisibilityLibrary` that provides a type and a function for handling requests related to deleted tweets, using a set of features and a rule engine provided by the `VisibilityLibrary` and a `TombstoneGenerator`.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` function?
- The `apply` function takes three inputs: a `VisibilityLibrary`, a `Decider`, and a `TombstoneGenerator`. It returns a function that takes a `Request` object and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]`, which is a type of asynchronous computation that can produce a `VisibilityResult`.

3. What features are used in the `featureMap`?
- The `featureMap` is built using three features: `TweetIsInnerQuotedTweet`, `TweetIsRetweet`, and `TweetDeleteReason`. These features are used to provide constant values based on the `isInnerQuotedTweet`, `isRetweet`, and `tweetDeleteReason` fields of the `Request` object, respectively.
