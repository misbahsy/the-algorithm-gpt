The `BlenderVisibilityRequest` class is a part of the Twitter Algorithm project and is used to represent a request for visibility of a tweet. It contains information about the tweet, such as the tweet itself, any quoted tweet, and any retweet source tweet. It also contains information about the safety level of the tweet, the viewer context, and the BlenderVFRequestContext.

The `BlenderVisibilityRequest` class has several methods that can be used to retrieve information about the tweet. The `getTweetID` method returns the ID of the tweet. The `hasQuotedTweet` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet has a quoted tweet. The `hasSourceTweet` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet has a retweet source tweet. The `getQuotedTweetId` method returns the ID of the quoted tweet, or -1 if there is no quoted tweet. The `getSourceTweetId` method returns the ID of the retweet source tweet, or -1 if there is no retweet source tweet.

This class is used in the larger project to represent a request for visibility of a tweet. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods to determine the visibility of a tweet based on various factors, such as the safety level and viewer context. For example, the `BlenderVisibilityRequest` class may be used in a method that determines whether a tweet should be visible to a particular user based on their location or interests.

Example usage:

```
val tweet = Tweet(...)
val quotedTweet = Some(Tweet(...))
val retweetSourceTweet = Some(Tweet(...))
val safetyLevel = SafetyLevel(...)
val viewerContext = ViewerContext(...)
val blenderVFRequestContext = BlenderVFRequestContext(...)

val request = BlenderVisibilityRequest(tweet, quotedTweet, retweetSourceTweet, isRetweet = true, safetyLevel, viewerContext, blenderVFRequestContext)

val tweetId = request.getTweetID
val hasQuotedTweet = request.hasQuotedTweet
val quotedTweetId = request.getQuotedTweetId
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a case class called `BlenderVisibilityRequest` that contains information about a tweet and its visibility settings. It is likely used in the larger project to determine how tweets are displayed to different users based on their safety level and viewer context.

2. What are the possible values for `SafetyLevel` and `ViewerContext`?
- The code does not provide information on the possible values for these two case classes. A smart developer might need to consult other parts of the project or documentation to determine the valid options.

3. Why are `quotedTweet` and `retweetSourceTweet` optional parameters?
- These parameters are optional because not all tweets will have quoted or retweeted content. By making them optional, the code can handle cases where these fields are not present without throwing an error.
