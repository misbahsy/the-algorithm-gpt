The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` code file contains a Scala object that provides a method to enrich the verdict of a `VisibilityResult` object with a `LimitedActionsPolicy`. The `LimitedActionsPolicy` is a policy that limits the actions that a user can take on a tweet. The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object takes in a `VisibilityResult` object, a `LocalizedLimitedActionsSource` object, a language code, a country code, a `FeatureSwitches` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It returns a new `VisibilityResult` object with the verdict enriched with a `LimitedActionsPolicy`.

The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object has a `PolicyFeatureSwitchResults` case class that contains four fields: `limitedActionTypes`, `copyNamespace`, `promptType`, and `learnMoreUrl`. These fields are used to configure the `LimitedActionsPolicy`. The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object also has a `FeatureSwitchKeys` object that contains keys for the `limitedActionTypes`, `copyNamespace`, `promptType`, and `learnMoreUrl` fields.

The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object has a `DefaultCopyNameSpace` field that is set to `"Default"`, a `DefaultPromptType` field that is set to `"basic"`, a `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichmentScope` field that is set to `"limited_actions_policy_enrichment"`, a `MissingLimitedActionTypesScope` field that is set to `"missing_limited_action_types"`, and an `ExecutedScope` field that is set to `"executed"`. These fields are used to scope the `StatsReceiver` object.

The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object has two private methods: `enrichVerdict` and `limitedActionsPolicyForReason`. The `enrichVerdict` method takes in a `verdict` object, a `LocalizedLimitedActionsSource` object, a language code, a country code, a `FeatureSwitches` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It returns a new `Action` object with the `policy` field set to a `LimitedActionsPolicy`. The `limitedActionsPolicyForReason` method takes in a `LimitedEngagementReason` object, a `LocalizedLimitedActionsSource` object, a language code, a country code, a `FeatureSwitches` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It returns an `Option[LimitedActionsPolicy]` object.

The `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object has a `apply` method that takes in a `VisibilityResult` object, a `LocalizedLimitedActionsSource` object, a language code, a country code, a `FeatureSwitches` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It returns a new `VisibilityResult` object with the verdict enriched with a `LimitedActionsPolicy`. The `apply` method calls the `enrichVerdict` method to enrich the verdict of the `VisibilityResult` object and the `secondaryVerdicts` field of the `VisibilityResult` object.

Overall, the `LimitedActionsPolicyEnrichment` object provides a way to limit the actions that a user can take on a tweet. It does this by enriching the verdict of a `VisibilityResult` object with a `LimitedActionsPolicy`. The `LimitedActionsPolicy` is configured using a `LocalizedLimitedActionsSource` object, a language code, a country code, a `FeatureSwitches` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides an enrichment for limited actions policy for tweets on Twitter. It allows for the customization of the limited actions policy based on various factors such as language, country, and feature switches.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` function?
- The `apply` function takes in a `VisibilityResult`, `LocalizedLimitedActionsSource`, `languageCode`, `countryCode`, `FeatureSwitches`, and `StatsReceiver` as inputs. It returns a `VisibilityResult`.

3. What is the purpose of the `LimitedActionsPolicy` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `LimitedActionsPolicy` class represents the policy for limited engagements on Twitter. It is used to create a new `LimitedActionsPolicy` object based on the limited action types specified in the feature switches and the localized limited actions source. This object is then used to update the `policy` field of the `LimitedEngagements`, `InterstitialLimitedEngagements`, and `EmergencyDynamicInterstitial` objects in the `enrichVerdict` function.
