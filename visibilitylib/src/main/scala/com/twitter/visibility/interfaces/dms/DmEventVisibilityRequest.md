The code above defines a case class called DmEventVisibilityRequest, which is used to represent a request to change the visibility of a direct message event in Twitter's messaging system. The class takes three parameters: dmEventId, which is the ID of the direct message event; safetyLevel, which is an enum representing the desired level of visibility for the event; and viewerContext, which is an object representing the context of the user making the request.

The SafetyLevel enum is defined in another file and represents the different levels of visibility that can be set for a direct message event. The ViewerContext object is also defined in another file and represents the context of the user making the request, including their user ID and any relevant permissions.

This code is likely used in the larger project to handle requests to change the visibility of direct message events. For example, if a user wants to make a direct message event visible to a wider audience, they would make a request using this class with a higher safety level. The request would then be processed by other parts of the system to update the visibility of the event accordingly.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in code:

```
val request = DmEventVisibilityRequest(dmEventId = 12345, safetyLevel = SafetyLevel.Public, viewerContext = ViewerContext(userId = 67890, permissions = Seq("read", "write")))
// make request using request object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DmEventVisibilityRequest` case class?
- The `DmEventVisibilityRequest` case class is used to represent a request for visibility settings for a direct message event, including the ID of the event, the safety level, and the viewer context.

2. What are the possible values for the `SafetyLevel` enum?
- The `SafetyLevel` enum is imported from the `com.twitter.visibility.models` package and could have possible values of `Public`, `Protected`, or `Private`.

3. What is the `ViewerContext` class used for?
- The `ViewerContext` class is imported from the `com.twitter.visibility.models` package and is used to represent the context of the viewer, including their user ID and any additional information that may affect their visibility settings.
