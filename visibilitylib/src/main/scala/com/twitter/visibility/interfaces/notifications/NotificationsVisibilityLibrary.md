The `NotificationsVisibilityLibrary` code is a Scala object that provides a type and a function to filter notifications based on a set of rules. The purpose of this code is to apply visibility rules to notifications and determine whether they should be allowed or filtered out. The function takes in a `Notification` object and returns a `Stitch[NotificationsFilteringResponse]` object, which is either `Allow` or `Filtered`. 

The `NotificationsVisibilityLibrary` object imports several classes and packages, including `VisibilityLibrary`, `Stitch`, `Notification`, and `NotificationType`. It also defines several classes and objects, including `AuthorFeatures`, `AuthorDeviceFeatures`, `ViewerFeatures`, `CommunityNotificationFeatures`, `UnmentionNotificationFeatures`, `ViewerAdvancedFilteringFeatures`, `RelationshipFeatures`, `FeatureMap`, `NotificationId`, `NotificationsWriterV2`, `ViewerContext`, `AllowAction`, `Action`, and `RuleResult`. 

The `NotificationsVisibilityLibrary` object has two main functions: `apply` and `failCloseForFailures`. The `apply` function takes in several parameters, including `visibilityLibrary`, `userSource`, `userRelationshipSource`, `userDeviceSource`, `tweetSource`, `enableShimFeatureHydration`, `enableCommunityTweetHydration`, and `enableUnmentionHydration`. It creates several objects, including `authorFeatures`, `authorDeviceFeatures`, `viewerFeatures`, `communityNotificationFeatures`, `unmentionNotificationFeatures`, `viewerAdvancedFilteringFeatures`, and `relationshipFeatures`. It then runs the rule engine on the `Notification` object using the `runRuleEngine` function and returns either `Allow` or `Filtered`. 

The `failCloseForFailures` function takes in a `VisibilityResult` object and returns a `Stitch[NotificationsFilteringResponse]` object. It checks whether the `VisibilityResult` object contains any failed or missing features and returns either `Allow` or `Failed` based on the result. 

Overall, the `NotificationsVisibilityLibrary` code is an important part of the larger project as it provides a way to filter notifications based on a set of rules. This helps to ensure that users only receive relevant notifications and reduces the amount of noise in their notifications feed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a visibility library for Twitter's notification service. It provides a way to filter notifications based on various features and rules, allowing for more targeted and personalized notifications for users.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` function?
- The `apply` function takes in several sources of data, including user information, tweet information, and feature gates. It returns a function that takes in a notification and returns a `Stitch` object that represents the filtering response.

3. What is the purpose of the `failCloseForFailures` function?
- The `failCloseForFailures` function is used to handle the results of the visibility rule engine. It checks if any features or rules failed or were missing, and returns a `Failed` response if so. Otherwise, it returns an `Allow` or `Filtered` response depending on the action taken by the rule engine.
