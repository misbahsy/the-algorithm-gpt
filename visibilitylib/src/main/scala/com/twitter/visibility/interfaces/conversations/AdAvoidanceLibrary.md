The `AdAvoidanceLibrary` is a Scala file that contains a library for avoiding ads in Twitter conversations. The library is designed to be used as part of a larger project that involves analyzing Twitter conversations for various purposes. The library takes in an `AdAvoidanceRequest` object, which contains information about the conversation, the tweets in the conversation, and the viewer context. The library then analyzes the tweets in the conversation to determine which ones should be avoided due to containing ads. The library returns an `AdAvoidanceResponse` object, which contains a map of tweet IDs to boolean values indicating whether the tweet should be dropped due to containing an ad.

The library uses several other classes and libraries to perform its analysis. These include the `TombstoneVisibilityLibrary`, which is used to determine whether a tweet should be avoided due to containing a tombstone or interstitial, and the `FilteredReasonHelper`, which is used to determine whether a tweet should be avoided due to containing an ad. The library also uses several other classes and libraries for handling various aspects of the analysis, such as timing and statistics.

The library is designed to be used as part of a larger project that involves analyzing Twitter conversations. For example, the library could be used to filter out tweets containing ads from a conversation before displaying it to a user. The library could also be used to analyze conversations for other purposes, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling. Overall, the `AdAvoidanceLibrary` is a useful tool for analyzing Twitter conversations and filtering out unwanted content.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a library for avoiding ads in Twitter conversations by checking if a tweet should be avoided based on certain criteria. It solves the problem of unwanted ads appearing in Twitter conversations.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `AdAvoidanceLibrary` function?
- The `AdAvoidanceLibrary` function takes in a `VisibilityLibrary` and a `Decider` as inputs, and returns a function that takes in an `AdAvoidanceRequest` and returns a `Stitch[AdAvoidanceResponse]`. The `AdAvoidanceRequest` contains information about the conversation, tweets, and viewer context, while the `AdAvoidanceResponse` contains a map of tweet IDs and whether they should be dropped or not.

3. What is the purpose of the `shouldAvoid` functions and how are they used?
- The `shouldAvoid` functions are used to determine whether a tweet should be avoided based on its `TweetFieldsResultState` and/or `VfTombstone`. They are used in the `buildLibrary` function to generate a map of tweet IDs and whether they should be dropped or not, which is returned in the `AdAvoidanceResponse`.
