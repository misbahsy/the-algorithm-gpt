The `CardVisibilityLibraryParityTest` class is a part of the Twitter Algorithm project and is used to test the parity of two `VisibilityResult` objects. The purpose of this class is to ensure that the results of two different methods that calculate the visibility of a card are the same. 

The class has a constructor that takes a `StatsReceiver` object as a parameter. This object is used to record statistics about the parity test, such as the number of requests, the number of times the results were equal, the number of times they were incorrect, and the number of failures. 

The `runParityTest` method takes two `VisibilityResult` objects as parameters: `preHydratedFeatureVisibilityResult` and `resp`. The first object is the result of one method that calculates the visibility of a card, while the second object is the result of another method that calculates the same thing. The method then compares the `verdict` field of the two objects. If they are equal, the `equal` counter is incremented. Otherwise, the `incorrect` counter is incremented. 

If an exception is thrown during the comparison, the `failures` counter is incremented. The method always returns a `Stitch[Unit]` object, which is a type of Future that represents a computation that will eventually complete with a value of type `Unit`. 

This class is likely used in the larger Twitter Algorithm project to ensure that different methods that calculate the visibility of a card produce the same result. This is important because it ensures that the algorithm is consistent and that the results are not affected by changes in the implementation of the algorithm. 

Example usage:

```
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()
val parityTest = new CardVisibilityLibraryParityTest(statsReceiver)

val result1 = calculateVisibility(card)
val result2 = calculateVisibilityUsingDifferentMethod(card)

parityTest.runParityTest(result1, result2)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code is a parity test for a card visibility library, which checks if the results of pre-hydrated feature visibility and actual visibility match. It ensures that the library is working correctly and producing consistent results.
2. What dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on two dependencies: `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver` and `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`. The former is used for collecting and reporting statistics, while the latter is a library for composing asynchronous computations.
3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
   - This code tracks four metrics using the `StatsReceiver` dependency: `requests`, `equal`, `incorrect`, and `failures`. `requests` counts the number of times the `runParityTest` method is called, `equal` counts the number of times the pre-hydrated and actual results match, `incorrect` counts the number of times they don't match, and `failures` counts the number of times an exception is thrown during the test.
