The `DESRealtimeVisibilityLibrary` is a Scala class that provides a real-time visibility check for tweets on Twitter. It is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this code is to determine whether a tweet should be visible to a particular viewer based on various features and rules. 

The `DESRealtimeVisibilityRequest` case class takes in a `Tweet`, an `author` of the tweet, and an optional `viewer` of the tweet. The `apply` method of the `DESRealtimeVisibilityLibrary` class takes in a `VisibilityLibrary` object and returns a function that takes in a `DESRealtimeVisibilityRequest` object and returns a `Stitch[vfthrift.Action]`. 

The function first increments a counter for the number of requests to the visibility engine. It then extracts the tweet, author, and viewer from the request and creates a `ViewerContext` object. It then creates various feature objects such as `TweetFeatures`, `AuthorFeatures`, `ViewerFeatures`, `CommunityTweetFeaturesV2`, `ExclusiveTweetFeatures`, `TrustedFriendsFeatures`, and `EditTweetFeatures`. These feature objects are used to build a feature map that is passed to the `VisibilityLibrary` object's `runRuleEngine` method. 

The `runRuleEngine` method takes in a `ContentId`, a feature map, a `ViewerContext`, and a `SafetyLevel`. It returns a `VisibilityResult` object that contains a `verdict` and a `reason`. The `mergeResults` method takes in two `VisibilityResult` objects, one for the tweet and one for the author, and returns a `vfthrift.Action` object that represents the final verdict for the tweet's visibility. 

Overall, this code provides a way to check whether a tweet should be visible to a particular viewer based on various features and rules. It can be used in the larger project to ensure that tweets are only visible to the appropriate audience. 

Example usage:

```
val visibilityLibrary = new VisibilityLibrary(...)
val desRealtimeVisibilityLibrary = DESRealtimeVisibilityLibrary(visibilityLibrary)

val tweet = ...
val author = ...
val viewer = ...

val request = DESRealtimeVisibilityRequest(tweet, author, Some(viewer))
val result = desRealtimeVisibilityLibrary(request).run()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a real-time visibility library for tweets and users on Twitter.

2. What are the main dependencies of this code?
- The main dependencies of this code are the Thrift-based libraries `gizmoduck`, `stitch`, and `tweetypie`, as well as the `VisibilityLibrary` library and several other custom libraries for building tweet and user features.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a `Stitch` object that represents the result of running the real-time visibility engine on a given tweet, author, and viewer. The output is determined by merging the results of running the engine on the tweet and author separately, and returning the first non-`Allow` verdict as a Thrift `Action`.
