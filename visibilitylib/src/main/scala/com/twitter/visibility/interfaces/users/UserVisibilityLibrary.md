The `UserVisibilityLibrary` object is a Scala implementation of a user visibility library for Twitter. The library is responsible for determining whether a user can view content based on their relationship with the author of the content and their search safety settings. The library is used in conjunction with other components of the larger Twitter system to ensure that users only see content that is appropriate for them.

The library is implemented as a function that takes four parameters: a `User` object representing the user who is trying to view the content, a `SafetyLevel` object representing the user's search safety settings, a `ViewerContext` object representing the context in which the user is viewing the content, and a `UserVisibilityFilteringContext` object representing the context in which the content is being filtered. The function returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object representing the result of the visibility check.

The function first checks whether there are any user rules for the given safety level. If there are no rules, the content is allowed to be viewed. If there are rules, the function checks whether the viewer is the author of the content. If the viewer is the author, the content is allowed to be viewed. If the viewer is not the author, the function builds a feature map based on the viewer's features, the author's features, and the search context. The feature map is then used to run the rule engine, which determines whether the content is allowed to be viewed.

The `UserVisibilityLibrary` object also includes a `Const` function that returns a function that always returns the same result, either `Allow` or `Drop`. This function is used to create a rule that always allows or always drops content.

Overall, the `UserVisibilityLibrary` object is a critical component of the Twitter system that ensures that users only see content that is appropriate for them. The library is used in conjunction with other components of the system to provide a safe and enjoyable user experience.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a library for determining the visibility of Twitter users and their content based on various features and rules. It solves the problem of ensuring that users only see content that is appropriate and relevant to them.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `Type` function defined in this code?
- The `Type` function takes in four parameters: a `User` object, a `SafetyLevel` object, a `ViewerContext` object, and a `UserVisibilityFilteringContext` object. It returns a `Stitch` object that contains a `VisibilityResult` object.

3. What are some of the key features and rules used to determine user visibility in this code?
- Some of the key features used to determine user visibility include authorship, relationships between users, search context, and safe search settings. Rules are defined using the `RuleBase` object and can be based on factors such as user safety level and the presence of user-defined rules.
