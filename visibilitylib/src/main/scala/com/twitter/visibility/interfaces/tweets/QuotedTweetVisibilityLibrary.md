The `QuotedTweetVisibilityLibrary` is a Scala object that provides a type and a function for determining the visibility of a quoted tweet. The function takes a `QuotedTweetVisibilityRequest` object as input and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object as output. 

The `QuotedTweetVisibilityRequest` object contains information about the quoted tweet, the outer tweet, the viewer context, and the safety level. The `TweetAndAuthor` case class is used to represent the tweet ID and author ID of a tweet. The `ViewerContext` case class is used to represent the context of the viewer, including their user ID and other information. The `SafetyLevel` case class is used to represent the safety level of the tweet.

The function first increments a counter for the number of requests to the function. It then extracts the tweet IDs and author IDs from the input object and creates instances of several feature classes that are used to determine the visibility of the tweet. These feature classes include `AuthorFeatures`, `ViewerFeatures`, `RelationshipFeatures`, and `QuotedTweetFeatures`. The `featureMap` is then built using the `featureMapBuilder` method of the `VisibilityLibrary` object, which takes a sequence of feature objects as input.

The function then checks if feature hydration in the shim is enabled. If it is, it creates an evaluation context using the `ProvidedEvaluationContext` object and filters the feature map using the `ShimUtils.preFilterFeatureMap` method. If feature hydration is not enabled, the function simply uses the `featureMap` object to run the rule engine.

The `runRuleEngine` method of the `VisibilityLibrary` object is used to run the rule engine and determine the visibility of the tweet. The result is a `VisibilityResult` object that contains a verdict and a reason. If the verdict is `Drop`, the function maps the reason to a `UserUnavailableStateEnum` object and calls the `userStateVisibilityLibrary` function to determine the visibility of the user. If the verdict is not `Drop`, the function returns the `VisibilityResult` object.

Overall, the `QuotedTweetVisibilityLibrary` is an important component of the larger project that determines the visibility of quoted tweets. It uses several feature classes and the `VisibilityLibrary` object to run the rule engine and determine the visibility of the tweet. The function can be used to determine the visibility of a quoted tweet in various contexts, such as in a user's timeline or in search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a library for determining the visibility of quoted tweets on Twitter.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `QuotedTweetVisibilityRequest` object and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `FeatureMap` and `RuleEngine` classes?
- The `FeatureMap` class is used to map features of a tweet and its author to their corresponding values, while the `RuleEngine` class is used to evaluate these features and determine the visibility of the tweet.
