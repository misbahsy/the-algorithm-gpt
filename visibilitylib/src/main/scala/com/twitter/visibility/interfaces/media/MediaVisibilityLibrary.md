The `MediaVisibilityLibrary` object is a Scala implementation of a media visibility library for Twitter. The purpose of this library is to determine the visibility of media content (e.g. images, videos) based on various features and rules. The library takes in a `MediaVisibilityRequest` object and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object.

The `MediaVisibilityRequest` object contains information about the media content and the viewer context. The `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object contains information about the visibility of the media content, including whether it should be visible or not, and any associated metadata.

The `MediaVisibilityLibrary` object uses various classes and interfaces to determine the visibility of media content. These include `VisibilityLibrary`, `UserSource`, `TombstoneGenerator`, and `StratoClient`. The `VisibilityLibrary` class provides the core functionality for the library, while the `UserSource` class provides information about the viewer. The `TombstoneGenerator` class generates a "tombstone" message for media content that is not visible. The `StratoClient` class is used to retrieve metadata about the media content.

The `MediaVisibilityLibrary` object also uses various features and rules to determine the visibility of media content. These include `ViewerFeatures`, `MediaFeatures`, `MediaMetadataFeatures`, and `StratoMediaLabelMaps`. The `ViewerFeatures` class provides information about the viewer, while the `MediaFeatures` class provides information about the media content. The `MediaMetadataFeatures` class provides metadata about the media content, while the `StratoMediaLabelMaps` class provides safety labels for the media content.

The `MediaVisibilityLibrary` object uses a `FeatureMap` object to combine the various features and rules. The `FeatureMap` object is then used to determine the visibility of the media content based on the safety level and evaluation context. The `EvaluationContext` class provides information about the evaluation context, while the `ShimUtils` class provides utility functions for the library.

Overall, the `MediaVisibilityLibrary` object provides a powerful and flexible way to determine the visibility of media content on Twitter. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as content moderation, content filtering, and content recommendation. Here is an example of how the library might be used:

```
val visibilityLibrary = new VisibilityLibrary(...)
val userSource = new UserSource(...)
val tombstoneGenerator = new TombstoneGenerator(...)
val stratoClient = new StratoClient(...)

val mediaVisibilityLibrary = MediaVisibilityLibrary(
  visibilityLibrary,
  userSource,
  tombstoneGenerator,
  stratoClient
)

val mediaVisibilityRequest = MediaVisibilityRequest(...)
val visibilityResult = mediaVisibilityLibrary(mediaVisibilityRequest).run()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a `MediaVisibilityLibrary` object that provides a `Type` function to handle media visibility requests. It uses various features and sources to evaluate the visibility of media content based on viewer context and safety level.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including `Stitch`, `StratoClient`, `VisibilityLibrary`, `UserSource`, `TombstoneGenerator`, and various `Features` and `Sources`. These dependencies are used to build a `featureMap` that is used to evaluate the visibility of media content.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `Type` function provided by this code?
- The `Type` function takes a `MediaVisibilityRequest` object as input and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object as output. The `MediaVisibilityRequest` object contains information about the media content and viewer context, while the `VisibilityResult` object contains information about the visibility of the media content.
