The `DmVisibilityLibrary` object is a Scala implementation of a visibility library for Twitter's direct messages (DMs). The purpose of this library is to determine whether a DM is safe for a viewer to see based on various features and rules. 

The library takes in a `DmVisibilityRequest` object, which contains the ID of the DM, the user ID of the DM author, and the viewer context. It returns a `DmVisibilityResponse` object, which indicates whether the DM is safe for the viewer to see. 

The library uses the `VisibilityLibrary` class to build a feature map based on the author of the DM. It then runs the rule engine on the feature map to determine whether the DM is safe for the viewer to see. If the feature map is hydrated with additional features, it resolves the feature map before running the rule engine. 

The `DmVisibilityLibrary` object also contains a `buildResponse` method that takes in a `VisibilityResult` object and returns a `DmVisibilityResponse` object. The `VisibilityResult` object contains the verdict of the rule engine, which is either `Drop` or `Pass`. If the verdict is `Drop`, the `buildResponse` method checks the reason for the drop and sets the `isMessageNsfw` field of the `DmVisibilityResponse` object to `true` if the reason is `Nsfw`, `ErasedAuthor`, or `DeactivatedAuthor`. Otherwise, it sets the field to `false`. 

This library is likely used in Twitter's DM system to ensure that users are not exposed to inappropriate content. It can be used by other Twitter services that need to determine the safety of DMs as well. 

Example usage:

```
val visibilityLibrary = new VisibilityLibrary(...)
val stratoClient = new StratoClient(...)
val userSource = new UserSource(...)
val dmVisibilityLibrary = DmVisibilityLibrary(visibilityLibrary, stratoClient, userSource)

val request = DmVisibilityRequest(dmId, dmAuthorUserId, viewerContext)
val response = dmVisibilityLibrary(request)
println(response.isMessageNsfw)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala package for a project called The Algorithm from Twitter that provides a type and function for determining the visibility of direct messages (DMs) based on various features and rules.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.servo.util.Gate`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, and `com.twitter.strato.client.Client`, among others.
3. What is the structure of the `DmVisibilityRequest` and `DmVisibilityResponse` case classes?
- The `DmVisibilityRequest` case class has three fields: `dmId` (a `DmId` object), `dmAuthorUserId` (a `UserId` object), and `viewerContext` (a `ViewerContext` object). The `DmVisibilityResponse` case class has one field: `isMessageNsfw` (a Boolean value).
