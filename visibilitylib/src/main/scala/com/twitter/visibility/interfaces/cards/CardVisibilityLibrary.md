The `CardVisibilityLibrary` object is a Scala implementation of a visibility library for Twitter cards. The purpose of this library is to determine whether a given card should be visible to a particular viewer based on a set of rules. The library takes in a `CardVisibilityRequest` object, which contains information about the card, the viewer, and the safety level of the request. The library then constructs a `FeatureMap` object based on the information in the request, which is used to evaluate the visibility of the card.

The `CardVisibilityLibrary` object contains several private methods that are used to construct the `FeatureMap` object. These methods take in various pieces of information from the `CardVisibilityRequest` object and use them to construct features that are relevant to the evaluation of the card's visibility. For example, the `getAuthorFeatures` method constructs features based on the author of the card, while the `getTweetFeatures` method constructs features based on the content of the card.

The `CardVisibilityLibrary` object also contains a `apply` method that takes in various sources of information, such as a `UserSource` and a `CommunitiesSource`, and constructs a function that can be used to evaluate the visibility of a card. This function takes in a `CardVisibilityRequest` object and returns a `Stitch[VisibilityResult]` object, which represents the result of the visibility evaluation.

The `CardVisibilityLibrary` object also contains several statistics-related objects, such as a `libraryStatsReceiver` and various `vfLatency` objects, which are used to track the performance of the library.

Overall, the `CardVisibilityLibrary` object is a key component of the larger Twitter card system, as it is responsible for determining whether a given card should be visible to a particular viewer. The library uses a set of rules and features to make this determination, and it is designed to be highly configurable and extensible.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines an object called `CardVisibilityLibrary` that contains several functions for building feature maps and running a rule engine to determine the visibility of a card on Twitter. It takes in various inputs such as user and tweet information, and outputs a `Stitch` object containing the result of the visibility check.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has several external dependencies, including `com.twitter.appsec.sanitization.URLSafety`, `com.twitter.decider.Decider`, `com.twitter.servo.util.Gate`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, `com.twitter.tweetypie.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.util.Stopwatch`, and `com.twitter.visibility.VisibilityLibrary`. It also imports several classes and objects from within the project.

3. What are the potential performance implications of using this code?
- The use of the `Stitch` object and the various feature map builders and rule engine functions could potentially have performance implications, especially if this code is being used frequently or with large amounts of data. Additionally, the use of external dependencies could also impact performance depending on their implementation and usage. Proper testing and optimization may be necessary to ensure optimal performance.
