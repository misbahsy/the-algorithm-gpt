This code defines a set of rules for downranking conversations on Twitter based on various conditions. The purpose of these rules is to reduce the visibility of conversations that contain content that is deemed to be low quality, abusive, or spammy. The rules are defined as objects that extend from a base class called `ConditionWithNotInnerCircleOfFriendsRule`, which takes a set of conditions and applies them to conversations that do not involve close friends.

The conditions used in these rules include tweet safety labels such as `HighToxicityScore`, `HighSpammyTweetContentScore`, and `HighCryptospamScore`, as well as user labels such as `NotGraduated` and `DownrankSpamReply`. These labels are assigned to tweets and users based on various factors such as language score thresholds and tweet content.

Each rule object also defines an action source builder, which is used to specify the type of action that should be taken when a conversation meets the conditions of the rule. For example, the `HighToxicityScoreDownrankHighQualitySectionRule` object specifies that tweets with a high toxicity score should be downranked in the high quality section of a conversation.

Overall, these rules are used to improve the quality of conversations on Twitter by reducing the visibility of content that is deemed to be low quality, abusive, or spammy. They are part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which aims to improve the user experience on the platform by using machine learning and other techniques to identify and address problematic content.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DownrankingRules` object?
- The `DownrankingRules` object contains several conditions that are used in the downranking rules defined in other objects.

2. What is the difference between the `ConditionWithNotInnerCircleOfFriendsRule` and `AuthorLabelWithNotInnerCircleOfFriendsRule` classes?
- The `ConditionWithNotInnerCircleOfFriendsRule` class applies a condition to a tweet, while the `AuthorLabelWithNotInnerCircleOfFriendsRule` class applies a label to the author of a tweet.

3. What is the significance of the `isEnabled` method in some of the rule objects?
- The `isEnabled` method checks whether a certain parameter is enabled before applying the rule. This allows for more flexibility in the application of the rules based on different configurations.
