The code defines three objects that represent different rules for determining the visibility of certain types of tweets on Twitter. These rules are part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely includes many other rules and algorithms for determining what content is shown to users on the platform.

The first object, `DropProtectedAuthorPollCardRule`, represents a rule that drops (i.e. hides) poll cards authored by protected accounts. A poll card is a type of tweet that includes a poll question and multiple answer options. A protected account is one that has restricted its tweets to only be visible to approved followers. The rule is defined using the `RuleWithConstantAction` class, which takes two arguments: the action to take if the rule is triggered (in this case, dropping the tweet with a reason of "ProtectedAuthor"), and the conditions under which the rule should be triggered. The conditions for this rule are that the tweet must be a poll card, the author must be a protected account, and the viewer must either be logged out or not following the author.

The second object, `DropCardUriRootDomainDenylistRule`, represents a rule that drops tweets containing links to certain domains. The domains to be blocked are specified in the `CardUriRootDomainDenyListParam` parameter. The rule is defined similarly to the first one, with the action of dropping the tweet with an unspecified reason, and the condition that the tweet must contain a link to one of the blocked domains.

The third object, `DropCommunityNonMemberPollCardRule`, represents a rule that drops poll cards posted by users who are not members of a particular community. A community is a group of Twitter users who share a common interest or identity. The rule is defined using several conditions: the tweet must be a poll card, it must be posted by a user who is part of the community, and the viewer must either not be a member of the community or the tweet must not be visible to the community. This rule has two additional methods, `enabled` and `enableFailClosed`, which specify whether the rule is currently enabled and whether it should fail closed (i.e. drop the tweet) if there is an error in the rule's configuration.

Overall, these rules are designed to help ensure that certain types of content are not shown to users on Twitter if they violate certain criteria. They are likely part of a larger set of rules and algorithms that work together to determine what content is shown to users on the platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a set of rules for determining the visibility of certain types of tweets on Twitter, specifically poll cards. It aims to prevent protected authors, non-community members, and certain card URIs from being visible to viewers.

2. What are the different conditions that are being checked in the rules?
- The conditions being checked include whether the tweet is a poll card, whether the author is protected, whether the viewer is logged out or not following the author, whether the tweet is a community tweet, and whether the viewer is a community member. There are also conditions related to card URIs and community visibility.

3. How are the rules enabled and what is the difference between `EnableCommunityNonMemberPollCardRule` and `EnableCommunityNonMemberPollCardRuleFailClosed`?
- The rules are enabled through the `enabled` and `enableFailClosed` methods, which return a sequence of `RuleParam[Boolean]` objects. `EnableCommunityNonMemberPollCardRule` enables the rule for dropping non-member poll cards, while `EnableCommunityNonMemberPollCardRuleFailClosed` enables the rule in a fail-closed mode, meaning that if there is an error in the rule evaluation, the card will be dropped by default.
