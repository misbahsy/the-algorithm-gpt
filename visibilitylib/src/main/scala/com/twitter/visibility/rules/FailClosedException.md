This code defines a set of exceptions that can be thrown when evaluating rules for a feature visibility system. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to handle errors that may occur during the evaluation of a rule, and to provide information about the state of the system at the time of the error.

The `FailClosedException` class is an abstract class that extends the `Exception` class. It takes three parameters: a message, a `State` object, and a rule name. The `State` object is an enumeration that represents the state of the system at the time of the error. There are three possible states: `MissingFeature`, `FeatureFailed`, and `RuleFailed`. The `MissingFeature` state is used when a required feature is missing, the `FeatureFailed` state is used when a feature fails to evaluate, and the `RuleFailed` state is used when a rule fails to execute.

The `MissingFeaturesException` class extends `FailClosedException` and takes two parameters: a rule name and a set of missing features. This exception is thrown when a rule evaluation has missing features. The message of the exception includes the number of missing features and their names.

The `FeaturesFailedException` class extends `FailClosedException` and takes two parameters: a rule name and a map of feature failures. This exception is thrown when a rule evaluation has failed features. The message of the exception includes the number of failed features and their names and values.

The `RuleFailedException` class extends `FailClosedException` and takes two parameters: a rule name and an exception. This exception is thrown when a rule evaluation fails to execute. The message of the exception includes the name of the rule.

These exceptions can be used in the larger project to provide error handling for the feature visibility system. For example, if a rule fails to execute, a `RuleFailedException` can be thrown with information about the rule that failed and the exception that was thrown. This information can be used to debug the system and fix the issue. Similarly, if a required feature is missing, a `MissingFeaturesException` can be thrown with information about the missing feature. This information can be used to determine why the feature is missing and how to add it to the system. Overall, these exceptions provide a way to handle errors in the feature visibility system and provide information about the state of the system at the time of the error.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a set of exceptions that can be thrown when certain rules fail during evaluation.

2. What is the relationship between the `FailClosedException` class and the three case classes that extend it?
- The `FailClosedException` class is an abstract class that defines common behavior for all exceptions that can be thrown when a rule fails. The three case classes extend this class and provide specific implementations for different types of rule failures.

3. What is the purpose of the `getState` and `getRuleName` methods in the `FailClosedException` class?
- The `getState` method returns the state associated with the exception (e.g. `MissingFeature`, `FeatureFailed`, or `RuleFailed`). The `getRuleName` method returns the name of the rule that failed. These methods can be used to provide more information about the exception when it is caught and handled.
