The `RuleBase` object in the `com.twitter.visibility.rules` package contains a set of rules that determine the visibility of various types of content on Twitter. The `RuleMap` is a mapping of `SafetyLevel` to `VisibilityPolicy`, where each `VisibilityPolicy` contains rules for tweets, users, cards, direct messages (DMs), DM conversations, and DM events. 

The `RuleBase` object also contains several utility methods. `removeUnusedFeaturesFromFeatureMap` takes a `FeatureMap` and a sequence of `Rule`s and returns a new `FeatureMap` with only the features that are used in the given rules. `getFeaturesForRules` takes a sequence of `Rule`s and returns a set of all the features used in those rules. The remaining methods (`hasTweetRules`, `hasUserRules`, etc.) take a `SafetyLevel` and return a boolean indicating whether the corresponding `VisibilityPolicy` contains rules for the given content type.

The `RuleBase` object is likely used by other parts of the larger project to determine the visibility of content based on various safety levels. For example, when a user posts a tweet, the safety level of the tweet is determined based on factors such as the user's account status and the content of the tweet. The appropriate `VisibilityPolicy` is then retrieved from the `RuleMap` based on the safety level, and the tweet is filtered according to the rules in that policy. Similarly, when a user views their timeline or searches for content on Twitter, the visibility of the content they see is determined based on the safety level of their account and the content itself. The `RuleBase` object is used to apply the appropriate rules to filter the content. 

Example usage:
```
val featureMap = new FeatureMap(Map(AuthorScreenName -> "example_author", RawQuery -> "example_query"), Map.empty)
val rules = Seq(Rule("example_rule", Set(AuthorScreenName), Set.empty))
val filteredFeatureMap = RuleBase.removeUnusedFeaturesFromFeatureMap(featureMap, rules)
val hasTweetRules = RuleBase.hasTweetRules(SafetyLevel.AccessInternalPromotedContent)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RuleBase` object?
- The `RuleBase` object contains a map of `SafetyLevel` to `VisibilityPolicy` and several methods for working with rules and features.

2. What is the significance of the `DeprecatedFeatures` sequence?
- The `DeprecatedFeatures` sequence contains a list of features that are no longer used and have been deprecated.

3. What do the `hasTweetRules`, `hasUserRules`, `hasCardRules`, `hasDmRules`, `hasDmConversationRules`, and `hasDmEventRules` methods do?
- These methods check if a given `SafetyLevel` has rules for tweets, users, cards, direct messages, direct message conversations, and direct message events, respectively.
