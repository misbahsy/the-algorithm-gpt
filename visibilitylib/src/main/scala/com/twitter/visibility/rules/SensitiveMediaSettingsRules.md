The code defines a set of rules for labeling and dropping tweets containing sensitive media, such as adult content or violent images. The rules are defined as abstract classes and objects, which can be extended and instantiated to create specific rules for different types of sensitive media and tweet safety label types.

The rules are based on a set of conditions that must be met in order for a tweet to be labeled or dropped. These conditions include whether the viewer is logged in or out, whether the tweet author is the same as the viewer, and what the viewer's sensitive media settings level is. The rules also take into account whether the tweet contains media, such as images or videos, and whether the tweet safety label type matches the rule.

For example, the `AdultMediaTweetLabelDropRule` abstract class defines a rule for dropping tweets with adult content. The rule is based on the `LoggedInViewer` condition, which requires the viewer to be logged in, and the `ViewerHasAdultMediaSettingLevel` condition, which requires the viewer's sensitive media settings level to be set to "Drop". The rule also specifies the tweet safety label type as `TweetSafetyLabelType.NsfwHighPrecision`. This abstract class can be extended to create specific rules for different tweet safety label types, such as `AdultMediaNsfwHighPrecisionTweetLabelDropRule`.

Overall, this code provides a framework for enforcing sensitive media policies on Twitter by labeling and dropping tweets that violate these policies. The specific rules can be customized and extended as needed to meet the requirements of different use cases and policies.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines rules for dropping, interstitial, and tombstoning tweets based on their safety labels and viewer settings.

2. What are the different types of safety labels and conditions used in this code?
- The safety labels used in this code include Nsfw, GoreAndViolenceHighPrecision, and GoreAndViolenceReportedHeuristics. The conditions used include LoggedInViewer, LoggedOutViewer, ViewerHasAdultMediaSettingLevel, ViewerHasViolentMediaSettingLevel, ViewerHasOtherSensitiveMediaSettingLevel, TweetHasNsfwUserAuthor, TweetHasNsfwAdminAuthor, And, Or, Not, NonAuthorViewer, and TweetHasMedia.

3. What is the relationship between the different types of rules defined in this code?
- The different types of rules defined in this code are related to each other based on the safety label type and the action taken on the tweet. For example, there are drop rules, interstitial rules, and tombstone rules for each safety label type.
