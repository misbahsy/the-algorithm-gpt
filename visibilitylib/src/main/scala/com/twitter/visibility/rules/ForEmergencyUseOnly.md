The code defines several objects and classes related to rules and actions for Twitter's visibility features. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to enforce certain rules and actions based on the safety labels of tweets. 

The `EmergencyDynamicInterstitialActionBuilder` and `EmergencyDynamicComplianceTweetNoticeActionBuilder` objects define actions that can be taken when a tweet has a safety label of type `ForEmergencyUseOnly`. The former builds an `EmergencyDynamicInterstitial` object that can be used to display an interstitial message to users, while the latter builds a `ComplianceTweetNoticePreEnrichment` object that can be used to display a compliance notice for public interest tweets. 

The `EmergencyDynamicInterstitialRule` and `EmergencyDropRule` objects define rules that can be applied to tweets with the `ForEmergencyUseOnly` safety label. The former uses the `EmergencyDynamicInterstitialActionBuilder` to display an interstitial message, while the latter uses the `Drop` action to remove the tweet from search results. 

The `SearchEdiSafeSearchWithoutUserInQueryDropRule` object defines a more complex rule that drops tweets from search results if they have the `ForEmergencyUseOnly` safety label, the user is logged out or has opted in to filtering, and the search query does not contain the user's name. This rule can be enabled or disabled using the `EnableSearchIpiSafeSearchWithoutUserInQueryDropRule` parameter. 

Overall, this code provides a way to enforce safety rules and actions based on the safety labels of tweets. It can be used in conjunction with other visibility features to ensure that Twitter users are protected from harmful content. 

Example usage:

```
val tweet = // some tweet object
val featureMap = // map of tweet features
val ruleResult = EmergencyDynamicInterstitialActionBuilder.build(evaluationContext, featureMap)
if (ruleResult.state == State.Evaluated) {
  val interstitial = ruleResult.action.asInstanceOf[EmergencyDynamicInterstitial]
  // display interstitial to user
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines rules and actions related to emergency tweets and search queries on Twitter, including interstitials and compliance notices.

2. What are the different types of conditions and actions defined in this code?
- The code defines several conditions, including TweetHasLabel, SearchQueryHasUser, LoggedOutOrViewerOptInFiltering, and And. It also defines several actions, including EmergencyDynamicInterstitial, ComplianceTweetNoticePreEnrichment, and Drop.

3. How is the EmergencyDynamicInterstitialRule different from the EmergencyDropRule and the SearchEdiSafeSearchWithoutUserInQueryDropRule?
- The EmergencyDynamicInterstitialRule triggers an interstitial for tweets labeled as ForEmergencyUseOnly, while the EmergencyDropRule drops such tweets altogether. The SearchEdiSafeSearchWithoutUserInQueryDropRule drops tweets labeled as ForEmergencyUseOnly only in certain search query scenarios.
