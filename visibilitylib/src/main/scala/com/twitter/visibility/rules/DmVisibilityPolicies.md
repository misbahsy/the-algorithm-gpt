This code defines a set of visibility policies for direct messages in Twitter. The policies are defined as objects that extend the `VisibilityPolicy` class. Each policy specifies a set of rules that determine which direct messages are visible to a user. 

The `SensitiveMediaSettingsDirectMessagesBaseRules` object defines a set of rules that apply to all direct message policies. These rules are related to sensitive media content and are specified as a map of `Rule` objects to `PolicyLevelRuleParams` objects. 

The `DirectMessagesPolicy` object defines the default policy for direct messages. It specifies a set of rules that determine which direct messages are visible to a user. These rules include `DeactivatedAuthorRule` and `ErasedAuthorRule`, which hide direct messages from deactivated or erased authors, respectively. 

Other policies are defined for specific use cases, such as `DirectMessagesMutedUsersPolicy`, which hides direct messages from suspended users, and `DirectMessagesSearchPolicy`, which specifies rules for searching direct messages. 

Each policy specifies a set of rules for `dmConversationRules`, `dmEventRules`, `userRules`, and `tweetRules`. These rules determine which direct messages are visible to a user based on various criteria, such as the conversation participants, the content of the messages, and the user's relationship to the conversation participants. 

Overall, this code defines a set of policies that determine which direct messages are visible to a user in Twitter. These policies are used to enforce Twitter's content policies and ensure that users are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content. 

Example usage:

```
val policy = DirectMessagesPolicy
val visibleMessages = policy.filterVisibleMessages(messages, user)
```

This code creates a `DirectMessagesPolicy` object and uses it to filter a list of direct messages `messages` based on the visibility rules for the user `user`. The resulting list `visibleMessages` contains only the direct messages that are visible to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SensitiveMediaSettingsDirectMessagesBaseRules` object?
- The `SensitiveMediaSettingsDirectMessagesBaseRules` object defines a mapping of rules to policy level rule parameters for sensitive media settings in direct messages.

2. What are the differences between the `DirectMessagesPolicy` and `DirectMessagesMutedUsersPolicy` objects?
- The `DirectMessagesPolicy` object defines visibility policies for direct messages, including deactivated and erased authors, while the `DirectMessagesMutedUsersPolicy` object only includes a rule for suspended authors.

3. What rules are included in the `DirectMessagesInboxPolicy` object?
- The `DirectMessagesInboxPolicy` object includes rules for dropping inaccessible or empty conversations and events, as well as rules for dropped events in one-to-one conversations with unavailable users and group events in one-to-one conversations. It also includes rules for non-perspectival events and welcome messages only visible to the recipient.
