This code defines a set of rules for filtering out certain types of users from receiving notifications on Twitter. Each rule is defined as an object with a name and a set of conditions that must be met in order for the rule to be applied. If the conditions are met, the rule will take a constant action of dropping the notification with an unspecified reason.

The rules are based on various criteria such as whether the viewer is the author of the tweet, whether the viewer follows the author, whether the author has confirmed their email or phone number, and whether the author has a default profile image. 

For example, the `NoConfirmedEmailRule` will drop the notification if the viewer is not the author, does not follow the author, has a filter that excludes users with unconfirmed emails, and the author themselves have not confirmed their email. 

These rules can be used in the larger project to improve the relevance and quality of notifications that users receive on Twitter. By filtering out certain types of users, the notifications can be tailored to the user's interests and preferences, leading to a better user experience. 

Here is an example of how one of the rules can be used in practice:

```
if (NoConfirmedEmailRule.appliesTo(notification, viewer)) {
  notification.drop(Unspecified)
}
```

This code checks if the `NoConfirmedEmailRule` applies to a given notification and viewer. If it does, the notification is dropped with an unspecified reason.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines several objects that implement different rules for filtering tweets based on various conditions related to the author and viewer of the tweet.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several classes from the `com.twitter.gizmoduck.thriftscala` and `com.twitter.visibility.features` packages, so it likely depends on those packages being available.

3. What actions are taken when a rule is triggered?
- Each object defines a `RuleWithConstantAction` that drops the tweet with an `Unspecified` reason if the conditions specified in the `And` clause are met. The conditions involve checking various properties of the author and viewer of the tweet.
