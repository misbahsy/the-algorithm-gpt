The `VisibilityParams` class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for creating and managing parameters for visibility of content on Twitter. It takes in several parameters such as `log`, `statsReceiver`, `decider`, `abDecider`, and `featureSwitches`. These parameters are used to create an instance of `VisibilityParams`.

The `VisibilityParams` class has two methods: `apply` and `memoized`. Both methods take in `viewerContext`, `safetyLevel`, and `unitsOfDiversion` as parameters. The `apply` method creates a new instance of `Params` using the `configBuilder` and `contextFactory`. The `configBuilder` is responsible for building the configuration for the visibility of content based on the `safetyLevel`. The `contextFactory` is responsible for creating a new instance of `VisibilityRequestContext` using the `abDecider` and `featureSwitches`. The `VisibilityRequestContext` contains information about the viewer, the safety level, and the units of diversion. The `apply` method then applies the `requestContext` and `paramStats` to the `config` to create a new instance of `Params`.

The `memoized` method is similar to the `apply` method, but it uses a memoized version of the `configBuilder`. This means that if the same `safetyLevel` is used multiple times, the configuration will only be built once and cached for future use.

Overall, the `VisibilityParams` class is an important part of the larger project as it is responsible for managing the parameters for the visibility of content on Twitter. It uses several other classes and parameters to create instances of `Params` that can be used to determine the visibility of content for different viewers. Here is an example of how the `VisibilityParams` class can be used:

```
val visibilityParams = VisibilityParams(log, statsReceiver, decider, abDecider, featureSwitches)
val viewerContext = ViewerContext(userId = "12345", countryCode = "US")
val safetyLevel = SafetyLevel.Normal
val unitsOfDiversion = Seq(UnitOfDiversion("topic", "politics"))
val params = visibilityParams.apply(viewerContext, safetyLevel, unitsOfDiversion)
```

In this example, a new instance of `VisibilityParams` is created using the required parameters. Then, a new `ViewerContext` is created with a user ID of "12345" and a country code of "US". The `SafetyLevel` is set to `Normal` and a `UnitOfDiversion` is created with a topic of "politics". Finally, the `apply` method is called with these parameters to create a new instance of `Params`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code defines a class and an object that provide functionality for generating visibility parameters for Twitter's timeline service. It solves the problem of determining which tweets should be visible to which users based on various factors such as user preferences and safety settings.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several external libraries including `com.twitter.abdecider`, `com.twitter.decider`, `com.twitter.featureswitches.v2`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, `com.twitter.logging`, `com.twitter.servo.util`, `com.twitter.timelines.configapi`, `com.twitter.visibility.models`.
3. What is the difference between the `apply` and `memoized` methods in the `VisibilityParams` class?
   - The `apply` method generates visibility parameters based on the input parameters and applies them to the configuration. The `memoized` method does the same thing, but also caches the results for future use.
