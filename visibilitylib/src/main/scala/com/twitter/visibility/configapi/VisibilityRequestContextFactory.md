The `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` class is responsible for creating a `VisibilityRequestContext` object, which contains information about the viewer context, safety level, and units of diversion. This object is used to determine whether or not a user is allowed to view certain content based on their safety level and other factors.

The `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` takes in two parameters: a `LoggingABDecider` object and a `FeatureSwitches` object. These objects are used to determine whether or not a user is allowed to view certain content based on their safety level and other factors.

The `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` has a private method called `getFeatureContext` that takes in a `ViewerContext`, `SafetyLevel`, and a sequence of `UnitOfDiversion` objects. This method creates a `FSRecipient` object that contains information about the viewer context, safety level, and units of diversion. It then uses the `FeatureSwitches` object to match the recipient and returns a `FeatureSwitchResultsFeatureContext` object.

The `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` has a public method called `apply` that takes in a `ViewerContext`, `SafetyLevel`, and a sequence of `UnitOfDiversion` objects. This method creates an experiment context based on the user ID and feature context. It then returns a `VisibilityRequestContext` object that contains information about the viewer context, safety level, experiment context, and feature context.

Overall, the `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` is an important part of the larger project as it is responsible for determining whether or not a user is allowed to view certain content based on their safety level and other factors. It uses the `LoggingABDecider` and `FeatureSwitches` objects to make these determinations and creates a `VisibilityRequestContext` object that is used throughout the project to control content visibility. 

Example usage:

```
val factory = new VisibilityRequestContextFactory(loggingABDecider, featureSwitches)
val context = factory.apply(viewerContext, safetyLevel, unitsOfDiversion)
// use context to determine content visibility
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala class called `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` that creates a `VisibilityRequestContext` object. It likely solves the problem of managing visibility settings for different types of users or viewers on Twitter.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `LoggingABDecider`, `FeatureSwitches`, `UserRecipientExperimentContextFactory`, and `FeatureSwitchResultsFeatureContext`. These dependencies likely provide additional functionality or data needed to create the `VisibilityRequestContext` object.

3. What input parameters are required to use this code?
- To use this code, a developer would need to provide a `ViewerContext` object, a `SafetyLevel` object, and an optional sequence of `UnitOfDiversion` objects. These input parameters likely provide the necessary information to determine the visibility settings for a given user or viewer.
