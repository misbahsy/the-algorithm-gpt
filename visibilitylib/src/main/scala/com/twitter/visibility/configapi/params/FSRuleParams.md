This code defines a set of feature switch keys and rule parameters for the Twitter Visibility project. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure and enable/disable various rules that control the visibility of tweets on the Twitter platform. 

The `FeatureSwitchKey` object defines a set of constants that represent the names of the feature switches. These switches are used to enable or disable specific rules that control the visibility of tweets. Each switch is associated with a specific rule that can be turned on or off by setting the switch to true or false.

The `FSRuleParam` abstract class is a base class for all rule parameters. It defines the name and default value of the parameter. The `FSBoundedRuleParam` and `FSTimeRuleParam` classes extend `FSRuleParam` and add support for bounded and time-based parameters, respectively. The `FSEnumRuleParam` class extends `EnumRuleParam` and adds support for enumerated parameters.

The `FSRuleParams` object defines a set of rule parameters that can be used to configure the visibility rules. Each parameter is associated with a specific feature switch key and has a default value. The parameters can be used to enable or disable specific rules or to set the thresholds for specific rules.

Overall, this code provides a way to configure and enable/disable various rules that control the visibility of tweets on the Twitter platform. The feature switches and rule parameters defined in this code can be used in other parts of the Twitter Visibility project to control the behavior of the visibility rules. For example, the `HighSpammyTweetContentScoreSearchTopProdTweetLabelDropRuleThresholdParam` parameter can be used to set the threshold for dropping tweets with high spammy content scores in search results. 

Example usage:

```
// Enable the community tweet drop rule
FSRuleParams.CommunityTweetDropRuleEnabledParam.enable()

// Set the threshold for dropping high spammy tweets in search results
FSRuleParams.HighSpammyTweetContentScoreSearchTopProdTweetLabelDropRuleThresholdParam.set(0.8)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a set of feature switch keys and their corresponding parameters for the visibility of tweets on Twitter. It is likely used in conjunction with other code to control the visibility of tweets based on various rules and thresholds.
2. What is the significance of the `private[visibility]` and `abstract` keywords used in this code?
- The `private[visibility]` keyword restricts access to the `FeatureSwitchKey` and `FSRuleParams` objects to only within the `visibility` package. The `abstract` keyword indicates that the classes `FSRuleParam`, `FSBoundedRuleParam`, `FSTimeRuleParam`, and `FSEnumRuleParam` are meant to be extended by other classes rather than instantiated directly.
3. What is the purpose of the `Bounded`, `HasTimeConversion`, and `EnumRuleParam` traits and how are they used in this code?
- The `Bounded` trait defines a minimum and maximum value for a parameter, which is used in the `FSBoundedRuleParam` class. The `HasTimeConversion` trait defines a conversion between a `Time` object and another type, which is used in the `FSTimeRuleParam` class. The `EnumRuleParam` trait defines an enumeration for a parameter, which is used in the `FSEnumRuleParam` class.
