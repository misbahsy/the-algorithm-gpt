The code above defines a Scala object called VisibilityExperimentsConfig that contains experiment configurations for the visibility feature of Twitter. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure experiments for different safety levels. 

The object imports several classes from other packages, including Config from com.twitter.timelines.configapi, RuleParams and VisibilityExperiments from com.twitter.visibility.configapi.params, and SafetyLevel and SafetyLevel._ from com.twitter.visibility.models. 

The object contains two experiment configurations: TestExperimentConfig and NotGraduatedUserLabelRuleHoldbackExperimentConfig. TestExperimentConfig is an A/B experiment configuration for the TestExperiment with the TestHoldbackParam. NotGraduatedUserLabelRuleHoldbackExperimentConfig is also an A/B experiment configuration, but for the NotGraduatedUserLabelRuleExperiment with the NotGraduatedUserLabelRuleHoldbackExperimentParam. 

The object also defines a config method that takes a SafetyLevel parameter and returns a sequence of Config objects. The method first matches the safetyLevel parameter with different cases. If the safetyLevel is Test, the method returns a sequence containing only the TestExperimentConfig. Otherwise, the method returns a sequence containing only the NotGraduatedUserLabelRuleHoldbackExperimentConfig. 

This code is used in the larger project to configure experiments for the visibility feature of Twitter. The SafetyLevel parameter allows for different experiment configurations to be used for different safety levels. For example, if the safety level is Test, the TestExperimentConfig will be used. If the safety level is not Test, the NotGraduatedUserLabelRuleHoldbackExperimentConfig will be used. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.visibility.models.SafetyLevel._
import com.twitter.visibility.configapi.configs.VisibilityExperimentsConfig

val safetyLevel = Test
val experimentConfigs = VisibilityExperimentsConfig.config(safetyLevel)
// experimentConfigs will contain only the TestExperimentConfig
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code defines experiment configurations for visibility rules in Twitter's backend system.
2. What are the different safety levels that can be passed into the `config` function?
   - The `config` function takes a `SafetyLevel` parameter, which can be one of the values defined in the `SafetyLevel` enum.
3. What is the role of the `ExperimentsHelper` import and where is it defined?
   - The `ExperimentsHelper` import is used to provide helper functions for creating experiment configurations. It is not defined in this file and must be imported from another location.
