The code defines a ConfigBuilder class and an associated object that provides a factory method for creating instances of the class. The purpose of the ConfigBuilder is to build a configuration object that is used to control the visibility of content on Twitter. The configuration is composed of several sub-configurations that are combined into a CompositeConfig object.

The ConfigBuilder takes three arguments: a DeciderGateBuilder, a StatsReceiver, and a Logger. The DeciderGateBuilder is used to create a DeciderGate, which is a type of Decider that can be used to gate access to content based on various criteria. The StatsReceiver is used to collect statistics about the configuration, and the Logger is used to log messages related to the configuration.

The ConfigBuilder has two methods: buildMemoized and build. The buildMemoized method returns a memoized version of the build method, which means that the result of the build method is cached and returned on subsequent calls with the same arguments. The build method takes a SafetyLevel argument and returns a Config object that is composed of several sub-configurations.

The sub-configurations are created using three different configuration classes: VisibilityExperimentsConfig, VisibilityDeciders, and VisibilityFeatureSwitches. The VisibilityExperimentsConfig class is used to configure experiments related to content visibility. The VisibilityDeciders class is used to configure Deciders that are used to gate access to content. The VisibilityFeatureSwitches class is used to configure feature switches that control the visibility of content.

Overall, the ConfigBuilder is an important component of the larger Twitter visibility system, as it is responsible for building the configuration that controls the visibility of content on the platform. The memoization of the build method ensures that the configuration is efficiently built and cached for future use.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and it appears to be related to configuration for visibility features. It likely solves the problem of managing and configuring different visibility settings based on safety level.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages including com.twitter.decider, com.twitter.finagle.stats, com.twitter.logging, com.twitter.servo.decider, com.twitter.timelines.configapi, and com.twitter.util.

3. What is the significance of the Memoize function in this code?
- The Memoize function is used to cache the results of the build function so that it doesn't need to be recalculated every time it is called with the same input. This can improve performance by reducing the number of times the function needs to be executed.
