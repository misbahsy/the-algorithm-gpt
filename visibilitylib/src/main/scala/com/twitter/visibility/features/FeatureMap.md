The code defines classes and methods for managing a map of features and their corresponding values. The `FeatureMap` class is a container for a map of `Feature` objects and their corresponding `Stitch` objects. A `Stitch` is a type of Future that is used to represent the value of a feature. The `FeatureMap` class also contains a map of constant values for features that do not have a `Stitch` object. The `FeatureMap` class provides methods for retrieving the value of a feature, checking if a feature is present in the map, and removing a feature from the map.

The `FeatureMap` object provides methods for creating an empty `FeatureMap` and for resolving the values of the `Stitch` objects in a `FeatureMap`. The `resolve` method takes a `FeatureMap` and returns a `Stitch` that resolves to a `ResolvedFeatureMap`. The `ResolvedFeatureMap` is a subclass of `FeatureMap` that contains only the resolved values of the `Stitch` objects in the original `FeatureMap`. The `resolve` method uses the `traverse` method of the `Stitch` class to resolve the `Stitch` objects in the `FeatureMap`. The `rescueFeatureTuple` method is used to handle exceptions that may occur when resolving a `Stitch` object.

The `MissingFeatureException` and `FeatureFailedException` classes are exceptions that are thrown when a feature is missing or when an error occurs while resolving a feature. The `FeatureFailedPlaceholderObject` class is a placeholder object that is used to represent a feature that has failed to resolve.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to manage a map of features and their corresponding values in a distributed system. The `Stitch` class is used to represent the value of a feature, which may be computed asynchronously. The `FeatureMap` class provides a way to manage a map of features and their corresponding `Stitch` objects, and the `resolve` method provides a way to resolve the `Stitch` objects in the map. The `ResolvedFeatureMap` class provides a way to represent the resolved values of the `Stitch` objects in the map. This code may be used in the larger project to manage the configuration of the system and to provide a way to dynamically update the configuration.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FeatureMap` class?
   
   The `FeatureMap` class is used to store a map of `Feature` objects to their corresponding `Stitch` objects or constant values.

2. What is the difference between `FeatureFailedException` and `MissingFeatureException`?
   
   `MissingFeatureException` is thrown when a `Feature` is not found in the `FeatureMap`, while `FeatureFailedException` is thrown when there is an error resolving the value of a `Feature`.

3. What is the purpose of the `resolve` method in the `FeatureMap` object?
   
   The `resolve` method takes a `FeatureMap` and returns a `Stitch` that resolves all the `Stitch` objects in the `FeatureMap` and returns a `ResolvedFeatureMap` object containing the resolved values.
