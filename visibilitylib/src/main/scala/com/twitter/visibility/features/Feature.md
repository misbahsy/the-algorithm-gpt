The code above defines an abstract class called `Feature` that is used to represent a feature in the larger project. The class takes a type parameter `T` and has a protected constructor that requires an implicit `Manifest` of type `T`. 

The `Feature` class has two methods: `name` and `toString`. The `name` method returns a string representation of the feature's name, which is obtained using the `NamingUtils.getFriendlyName` method. This method is likely used to generate a user-friendly name for the feature that can be displayed in the project's user interface or documentation.

The `toString` method returns a string representation of the feature, which includes the feature's type and class name. This method is likely used for debugging purposes or to provide additional information about the feature in logs or error messages.

Since `Feature` is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it must be extended by concrete feature classes that provide implementations for any abstract methods or properties. For example, a concrete feature class might look like this:

```
class MyFeature extends Feature[String] {
  // implementation details
}
```

In this example, `MyFeature` extends `Feature` and provides a type parameter of `String`. It can then implement any abstract methods or properties defined by `Feature` and use the `name` and `toString` methods inherited from the abstract class.

Overall, the `Feature` class provides a common interface for representing features in the larger project and includes methods for generating user-friendly names and string representations of features.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Feature class and how is it used in the project?
   - The Feature class is an abstract class that takes a type parameter T and has a lazy val for its name. It is used to define features in the project and can be extended to create specific feature implementations.
   
2. What is the significance of the manifest parameter in the Feature class constructor?
   - The manifest parameter is used to provide information about the type T at runtime. It is necessary for certain operations that require type information, such as serialization and deserialization.
   
3. What is the NamingUtils class and how is it used in the Feature class?
   - The NamingUtils class is a utility class that provides methods for generating user-friendly names for objects. In the Feature class, it is used to generate the name of the feature based on the class name.
