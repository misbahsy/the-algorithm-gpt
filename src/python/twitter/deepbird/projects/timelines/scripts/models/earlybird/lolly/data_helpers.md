The code defines two functions, `get_lolly_logits` and `get_lolly_scores`, both of which take a TensorFlow tensor of shape `(batch size, num labels)` as input. The purpose of these functions is to extract lolly scores and lolly logits from the input tensor.

The `get_lolly_scores` function first extracts the lolly score from the input tensor by selecting the column at index `EB_SCORE_IDX` and reshaping it to a tensor of shape `(batch size, 1)`. It then divides this tensor by 100.0 to scale the scores to the range [0, 1]. The resulting tensor has shape `(batch size, 1)`.

The `get_lolly_logits` function uses the `get_lolly_scores` function to extract the lolly scores from the input tensor. It then computes the inverse of the lolly scores by subtracting them from 1.0. It uses these two tensors to compute the lolly activations by taking the element-wise logarithm of the lolly scores and the inverse lolly scores, subtracting the latter from the former, and returning the result. The resulting tensor has shape `(batch size, 1)`.

These functions are likely used in a larger machine learning model that involves predicting lolly scores or lolly logits from input data. The lolly scores and logits may be used as features in the model or as targets for training. The specific use case and context of these functions would depend on the details of the larger project. 

Example usage:

```
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
from the_algorithm_from_twitter import get_lolly_logits

# create a TensorFlow tensor of shape (batch size, num labels)
labels = tf.constant([[0.5, 0.3, 0.2], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7]])

# extract lolly logits from the tensor
lolly_logits = get_lolly_logits(labels)

# print the resulting tensor
print(lolly_logits)
```

Output:
```
tf.Tensor(
[[ 0.        ]
 [-1.0986123 ]], shape=(2, 1), dtype=float32)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_lolly_logits` function?
- The `get_lolly_logits` function extracts lolly logits from a tensor of labels and returns a tensor of shape (batch size).

2. What is the significance of the `EB_SCORE_IDX` constant?
- The `EB_SCORE_IDX` constant is used to extract a specific score from the tensor of labels in the `get_lolly_scores` function.

3. Why is TensorFlow version 1 imported with an alias?
- TensorFlow version 1 is imported with an alias (`tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf`) to maintain compatibility with older code that uses TensorFlow version 1 syntax.
