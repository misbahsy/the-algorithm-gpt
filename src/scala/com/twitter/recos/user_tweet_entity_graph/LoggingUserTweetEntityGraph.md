The code defines a trait called `LoggingUserTweetEntityGraph` that extends the `UserTweetEntityGraph.MethodPerEndpoint` trait. This trait is used to log information about requests made to the `UserTweetEntityGraph` service. 

The `LoggingUserTweetEntityGraph` trait overrides two methods: `recommendTweets` and `findTweetSocialProofs`. Both methods take a request object and return a future response object. 

The `recommendTweets` method logs information about the request and response. It first calls the `super.recommendTweets` method to get the response, and then logs information about the request and response using the `accessLog` logger. The logged information includes the time of the request, the ID of the request, the requester ID, the display location, the recommendation types, the excluded tweet IDs, the seeds with weights, the max tweet age, the max user social proof size, the max tweet social proof size, the min user social proof sizes, the tweet types, the social proof types, the social proof type unions, and the size of the response. 

The `findTweetSocialProofs` method logs information about the request and response. It first calls the `super.findTweetSocialProofs` method to get the response, and then logs information about the request and response using the `accessLog` logger. The logged information includes the ID of the request, the requester ID, the seeds with weights, and the size of the response. 

This trait is likely used in a larger project to log information about requests made to the `UserTweetEntityGraph` service. It provides a way to track usage of the service and diagnose issues. 

Example usage:

```scala
val graph = new UserTweetEntityGraphImpl()
val loggingGraph = new LoggingUserTweetEntityGraph {
  override val underlying = graph
}
val request = RecommendTweetEntityRequest(...)
val response = loggingGraph.recommendTweets(request)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a trait called `LoggingUserTweetEntityGraph` that extends the `UserTweetEntityGraph.MethodPerEndpoint` trait and adds logging functionality to the `recommendTweets` and `findTweetSocialProofs` methods.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports classes from the `com.twitter.finagle.tracing`, `com.twitter.logging`, and `com.twitter.recos.user_tweet_entity_graph.thriftscala` packages.

3. What logging information is being recorded in this code?
- This code logs information such as the time of the request, the requester ID, the display location, the recommendation types, the excluded tweet IDs, the seeds with weights, and the size of the recommendations. It also logs any exceptions that occur and the time it takes to process the request.
