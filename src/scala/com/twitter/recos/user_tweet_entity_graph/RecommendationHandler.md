The `RecommendationHandler` class is an implementation of the Thrift-defined service interface for the Twitter recommendation system. It is a wrapper of `magicRecsRunner`, which is responsible for generating tweet recommendations for a given user. 

The `apply` method takes a `RecommendTweetEntityRequest` object as input and returns a `Future` of `RecommendTweetEntityResponse`. The `RecommendTweetEntityRequest` object contains information about the user for whom recommendations are being generated, such as the user ID and the display location. The `RecommendTweetEntityResponse` object contains a list of recommended tweets, hashtags, and URLs.

The `RecommendationHandler` class uses the `tweetRecsRunner` object to generate tweet recommendations for the user. It then processes the recommendations and creates a list of `UserTweetEntityRecommendationUnion` objects, which can contain either a `TweetRec`, `HashtagRec`, or `UrlRec`. Each of these objects contains information about the recommended tweet, hashtag, or URL, such as the recommendation ID, weight, and social proof.

The `SocialProofHydrator` object is used to add social proof to the recommendations. Social proof is additional information that can help the user decide whether to engage with the recommended tweet, hashtag, or URL. For example, social proof for a tweet recommendation might include the number of retweets or likes the tweet has received.

Overall, the `RecommendationHandler` class is an important component of the Twitter recommendation system, as it provides a way for users to receive personalized recommendations based on their interests and activity on the platform. 

Example usage:

```scala
val tweetRecsRunner = new TweetRecommendationsRunner()
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()
val recommendationHandler = new RecommendationHandler(tweetRecsRunner, statsReceiver)

val request = new RecommendTweetEntityRequest(userId = 123, displayLocation = DisplayLocation.HOME_TIMELINE)
val responseFuture = recommendationHandler.apply(request)

responseFuture.onSuccess { response =>
  response.recommendations.foreach {
    case UserTweetEntityRecommendationUnion.TweetRec(tweetRec) =>
      println(s"Recommended tweet: ${tweetRec.recommendation}")
    case UserTweetEntityRecommendationUnion.HashtagRec(hashtagRec) =>
      println(s"Recommended hashtag: ${hashtagRec.recommendation}")
    case UserTweetEntityRecommendationUnion.UrlRec(urlRec) =>
      println(s"Recommended URL: ${urlRec.recommendation}")
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is an implementation of a Thrift-defined service interface that acts as a wrapper of magicRecsRunner. It provides recommendations for tweet entities based on user behavior.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as Finagle, Frigate, GraphJet, and Servo.

3. What is the role of the SocialProofHydrator class in this code?
- The SocialProofHydrator class is responsible for adding social proof information to the tweet recommendations generated by the code. It is used to enhance the relevance and credibility of the recommendations.
