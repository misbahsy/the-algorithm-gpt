The `UserTweetEdgeTypeMask` class is used to encode edge types in the top bits of an integer. This is done to store information about the type of action taken on a tweet, such as favorite, retweet, reply, and click. The class extends the `EdgeTypeMask` trait and overrides its methods to encode, decode, and restore the edge type information. 

The `encode` method takes a node and an edge type as input and returns an integer with the edge type encoded in the top four bits. The `edgeType` method takes an integer as input and returns the edge type encoded in the top four bits. The `restore` method takes an integer as input and returns the same integer with the top four bits cleared.

The `UserTweetEdgeTypeMask` object defines the edge types as an enumeration. It also defines a mask and size for the edge types. The mask is used to clear the top four bits of an integer, leaving the lower 27 bits for the node information. The size is the number of edge types that can be encoded, which is 32 at most. 

The object also defines two methods. The `getUserTweetGraphSocialProofTypes` method maps valid social proof types specified by clients to an array of bytes. If clients do not specify any social proof types in thrift, it will return all available social types by default. The `actionTypeToEdgeType` method converts the action byte in the `RecosHoseMessage` into GraphJet internal byte mapping.

This code is used in the larger project to encode and decode edge types in the user-tweet entity graph. The encoded edge types are used to store information about the type of action taken on a tweet, which is used to generate recommendations for users. The `UserTweetEdgeTypeMask` class and object are used throughout the project to encode and decode edge types. The `getUserTweetGraphSocialProofTypes` method is used to map social proof types specified by clients to internal byte mapping. The `actionTypeToEdgeType` method is used to convert the action byte in the `RecosHoseMessage` into GraphJet internal byte mapping.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UserTweetEdgeTypeMask` class?
- The `UserTweetEdgeTypeMask` class is used to encode edge types in the top bits of an integer for a bipartite graph.

2. What are the different edge types that can be encoded using this implementation?
- The different edge types that can be encoded using this implementation include Click, Favorite, Retweet, Reply, Tweet, IsMentioned, IsMediatagged, Quote, and Unfavorite.

3. What is the purpose of the `getUserTweetGraphSocialProofTypes` method?
- The `getUserTweetGraphSocialProofTypes` method maps valid social proof types specified by clients to an array of bytes. If clients do not specify any social proof types in thrift, it will return all available social types by default.
