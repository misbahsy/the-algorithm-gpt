The `SocialProofHydrator` class is responsible for extracting and deduplicating social proofs from the GraphJet library. Social proofs are pieces of evidence that indicate the popularity or relevance of a tweet, such as the number of likes, retweets, or replies. The class provides several methods to extract social proofs of different types and formats.

The `getSocialProofs` method takes a social proof type, a sequence of user IDs, and a sequence of metadata IDs as input parameters. It returns a sequence of `SocialProof` objects that represent the social proofs for the given user IDs. If the social proof type is "favorite," the method deduplicates the user IDs to avoid counting multiple likes from the same user. The method uses a foldLeft operation to iterate over the user IDs and metadata IDs, keeping only the first occurrence of each user ID. The resulting sequence of unique user IDs is then mapped to `SocialProof` objects with the corresponding metadata IDs.

The `addTweetSocialProofs` method takes a `TweetRecommendationInfo` object as input parameter and returns an optional map of social proofs by type. The method extracts the social proofs from the `TweetRecommendationInfo` object and maps them to `SocialProof` objects using the `getSocialProofs` method. The resulting map of social proofs is then wrapped in an `Option` object and returned.

The `getSocialProofs` method takes a sequence of user IDs as input parameter and returns a sequence of unique user IDs. If the input sequence contains duplicate user IDs, the method increments a counter for duplicate social proofs. Otherwise, the method increments a counter for unique social proofs. The method uses the `distinct` method to remove duplicate user IDs from the input sequence.

The `addTweetSocialProofByType` method takes a `TweetRecommendationInfo` object as input parameter and returns a map of social proofs by type. The method extracts the social proofs from the `TweetRecommendationInfo` object and maps them to sequences of unique user IDs using the `getSocialProofs` method. The resulting map of social proofs is then returned.

The `addMetadataSocialProofByType` method takes a `TweetMetadataRecommendationInfo` object as input parameter and returns a map of social proofs by type and author ID. The method extracts the social proofs from the `TweetMetadataRecommendationInfo` object and maps them to sequences of tweet IDs by author ID. The resulting map of social proofs is then returned.

Overall, the `SocialProofHydrator` class provides a set of utility methods to extract and deduplicate social proofs from different types of input data. These methods are used in the larger project to generate recommendations based on the popularity and relevance of tweets. For example, the social proofs can be used to rank tweets in a user's timeline or to suggest new users to follow based on their interactions with popular tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SocialProofHydrator` class?
- The `SocialProofHydrator` class is responsible for extracting and deduplicating social proofs from GraphJet for tweets and tweet metadata.

2. Why does the `getSocialProofs` method only deduplicate social proofs for favorite social proof types?
- The `getSocialProofs` method only deduplicates social proofs for favorite social proof types because there are cases where one user can favorite, unfavorite, and then favorite the same tweet again, resulting in duplicate social proofs. This is not the case for reply or quote social proof types.

3. What is the difference between the `addTweetSocialProofs` and `addTweetSocialProofByType` methods?
- The `addTweetSocialProofs` method extracts and deduplicates social proofs from GraphJet for all social proof types, but only deduplicates social proofs for favorite social proof types. The `addTweetSocialProofByType` method extracts and deduplicates social proofs from GraphJet for all social proof types, including favorite social proof types.
