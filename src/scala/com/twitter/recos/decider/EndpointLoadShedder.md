The `EndpointLoadShedder` class provides load shedding functionality for a given endpoint using deciders. Load shedding is a technique used to reduce the load on a system during high traffic or overload situations by dropping some of the requests. The class takes a `GraphDecider` object as a parameter and defines a method `apply` that takes an endpoint name and a function that returns a `Future` of some type `T`. The `apply` method checks if a decider key is defined for the given endpoint and if it is available using the `isAvailable` method of the `GraphDecider` object. If the decider key is available, it throws a `LoadSheddingException`. Otherwise, it executes the `serve` function and returns its result as a `Future`.

The `EndpointLoadShedder` class is designed to be used in conjunction with a decider configuration file (`decider.yml`) that defines the decider keys for the endpoints. The format of the decider keys is `enable_loadshedding_<graphNamePrefix>_<endpoint name>`, where `<graphNamePrefix>` is the prefix of the graph name and `<endpoint name>` is the name of the endpoint. For example, `enable_loadshedding_user-tweet-graph_relatedTweets` is a valid decider key for the `relatedTweets` endpoint of the `user-tweet-graph` graph.

The `EndpointLoadShedder` class can be used to control the load on specific endpoints during incidents by adjusting the decider values in the `decider.yml` file. By defining decider keys for the endpoints that are critical to the system and adjusting their values during high traffic or overload situations, the system can shed load on less critical endpoints and maintain its overall performance and availability.

Example usage:

```scala
val graphDecider = new GraphDecider("my-graph")
val loadShedder = new EndpointLoadShedder(graphDecider)

val result: Future[String] = loadShedder("my-endpoint") {
  // code that returns a Future[String]
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides load shedding for a given endpoint using deciders, which can be controlled during incidents.

2. How are deciders used in this code?
- Deciders are fractional and defined using keys in the format of "enable_loadshedding_<graphNamePrefix>_<endpoint name>". If a decider key is not defined for a particular endpoint, those requests will always be served.

3. What is the purpose of the LoadSheddingException object?
- The LoadSheddingException object is an exception that is thrown when load shedding is enabled for a particular endpoint.
