The BipartiteGraphHelper class is a helper class that encodes and decodes tweet ids with tweetypie's card information when querying recos salsa library. This class is used in the larger project to retrieve edges from a BipartiteGraph object. 

The BipartiteGraphHelper class takes a BipartiteGraph object as a parameter in its constructor. The BipartiteGraph object is a graph that contains two types of nodes: left nodes and right nodes. The left nodes represent tweets, and the right nodes represent users who have engaged with the tweets. 

The BipartiteGraphHelper class has two methods: getLeftNodeEdges and getRightNodeEdges. The getLeftNodeEdges method takes a Long parameter that represents a left node (tweet) and returns a sequence of tuples. Each tuple contains a Long value that represents a tweet id and a Byte value that represents the engagement type. The method retrieves the edges of the left node from the BipartiteGraph object and decodes the tweet ids using the TweetIDMask object. The decoded tweet ids are then added to a ListBuffer along with their corresponding engagement types. The ListBuffer is then reversed to put the most recent edges first and remove any duplicates. The resulting sequence of tuples is returned.

The getRightNodeEdges method takes a Long parameter that represents a right node (user) and returns a sequence of Long values that represent tweet ids. The method retrieves the edges of the right node from the BipartiteGraph object and adds the tweet ids to a ListBuffer. The ListBuffer is then reversed to put the most recent edges first and remove any duplicates. The resulting sequence of tweet ids is returned.

Overall, the BipartiteGraphHelper class is an important helper class in the larger project as it allows for the retrieval of edges from a BipartiteGraph object and the decoding of tweet ids with tweetypie's card information. This class is used in conjunction with other classes and methods to provide recommendations to users based on their engagement with tweets. 

Example usage:

```
val bipartiteGraphHelper = new BipartiteGraphHelper(bipartiteGraph)
val leftNodeEdges = bipartiteGraphHelper.getLeftNodeEdges(tweetId)
val rightNodeEdges = bipartiteGraphHelper.getRightNodeEdges(userId)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BipartiteGraphHelper` class?
- The `BipartiteGraphHelper` class is a helper class that encodes and decodes tweet ids with tweetypie's card information when querying recos salsa library.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.twitter.graphjet` and `scala.collection.mutable` libraries.

3. What is the purpose of the `getLeftNodeEdges` and `getRightNodeEdges` methods?
- The `getLeftNodeEdges` method returns a sequence of left node edges with their engagement type, while the `getRightNodeEdges` method returns a sequence of right node edges. Both methods return the most recent edges first with no duplications.
