The `ActionEdgeTypeMask` class is used to encode edge types in the top bits of an integer. This is done to store up to 32 edge types in a segment that stores up to 128M unique nodes on one side. The class extends the `EdgeTypeMask` trait and overrides its three methods: `encode`, `edgeType`, and `restore`.

The `encode` method takes a node and an edge type as input and returns an integer that encodes the edge type in the top four bits of the integer. If the edge type is `FAVORITE`, `RETWEET`, `REPLY`, or `TWEET`, the corresponding value in the `EDGEARRAY` array is ORed with the node to encode the edge type. Otherwise, the value of `CLICK` is used to encode the edge type.

The `edgeType` method takes an integer as input and returns the edge type encoded in the top four bits of the integer. This is done by shifting the integer 28 bits to the right and casting the result to a byte.

The `restore` method takes an integer as input and returns the integer with the top four bits cleared. This is done by ANDing the integer with the `MASK` value, which is a binary number with 28 zeros followed by four ones.

The `ActionEdgeTypeMask` object defines several constants and an array. The constants are used to represent the different edge types that can be encoded in the top four bits of an integer. The `SIZE` constant is used to represent the number of valid social proof types. The `UNUSED6` to `UNUSED15` constants are not used. The `EDGEARRAY` array is used to encode the different edge types in the top four bits of an integer. Each element of the array is a value that is shifted 28 bits to the left.

The `getUserTweetGraphSocialProofTypes` method is used to map valid social proof types specified by clients to an array of bytes. If clients do not specify any social proof types in thrift, it will return all available social types by default. The method takes an optional sequence of `SocialProofType` values as input and returns an array of bytes representing valid social proof types. If the input is `None`, the method returns an array of bytes representing all available social proof types. Otherwise, it maps the `getValue` method of each `SocialProofType` value to an array of integers, casts each integer to a byte, and returns the resulting array of bytes.

Overall, the `ActionEdgeTypeMask` class and `ActionEdgeTypeMask` object are used to encode and decode edge types in an integer. This is useful for storing up to 32 edge types in a segment that stores up to 128M unique nodes on one side. The `getUserTweetGraphSocialProofTypes` method is used to map valid social proof types specified by clients to an array of bytes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an implementation of an EdgeTypeMask used to encode edge types in an integer for a graph data structure. It also includes a method to map social proof types to an array of bytes.

2. What edge types are supported by this implementation?
- This implementation supports five edge types: FAVORITE, RETWEET, REPLY, TWEET, and CLICK.

3. How are edge types encoded in an integer?
- Edge types are encoded in the top four bits of an integer using an array of integers called EDGEARRAY. The encode method uses this array to set the appropriate bits for the given edge type.
