The `FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper` class is a wrapper for Twitter's Finagle StatsReceiver. This is useful because the GraphJet library, which this code is a part of, is an open-source library that does not depend on Finagle, but still needs to track stats using a similar interface. 

The `FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper` class takes in a `StatsReceiver` object as a parameter and extends the `GraphStatsReceiver` trait. It provides two methods: `scope` and `counter`. 

The `scope` method takes in a `String` namespace and returns a new instance of `FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper` with the same `StatsReceiver` object, but with the namespace appended to it. This allows for hierarchical organization of stats. For example, if we have a `StatsReceiver` object for a service called "myService", we can create a new `FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper` with the namespace "requests" by calling `myService.scope("requests")`. 

The `counter` method takes in a `String` name and returns a new instance of `FinagleCounterWrapper`, which is another wrapper class that wraps Finagle's `Counter` class. The `FinagleCounterWrapper` class provides a similar interface to GraphJet's `Counter` class, allowing for consistent tracking of stats across the library. 

Overall, this code provides a way for GraphJet to use Finagle's StatsReceiver interface without depending on the Finagle library. It allows for consistent tracking of stats across the library and hierarchical organization of stats. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.NullStatsReceiver
import com.twitter.recos.graph_common.FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper

val statsReceiver = FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper(NullStatsReceiver)
val requestsCounter = statsReceiver.counter("requests")
requestsCounter.incr()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it relate to GraphJet and Finagle?
    
    This code defines a wrapper class for Finagle's StatsReceiver that is used by GraphJet, a library that tracks stats using a similar interface. The purpose is to allow GraphJet to use Finagle's StatsReceiver without depending on Finagle itself.

2. What methods are available in the FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper class?
    
    The FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper class has two methods: scope(namespace: String) and counter(name: String). The scope method returns a new FinagleStatsReceiverWrapper with a new namespace, while the counter method returns a new FinagleCounterWrapper with a counter of the given name.

3. What is the benefit of using a wrapper class for Finagle's StatsReceiver in GraphJet?
    
    The benefit of using a wrapper class is that GraphJet can use Finagle's StatsReceiver without depending on Finagle itself. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in the codebase. Additionally, it allows GraphJet to track stats using a similar interface to Finagle, which may make it easier to integrate with other libraries or systems that use Finagle.
