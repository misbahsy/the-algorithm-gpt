The code defines two classes, `LeftNodeEdgesHandler` and `RightNodeInfoHandler`, which implement different request handlers for a Thrift-defined service interface. The purpose of these handlers is to retrieve recent edges and node information from a bipartite graph, respectively. 

The `LeftNodeEdgesHandler` class takes in a `BipartiteGraphHelper` and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. It overrides the `apply` method of the `RequestHandler` trait, which takes in a `GetRecentEdgesRequest` object and returns a `Future` of `GetRecentEdgesResponse`. Within the `apply` method, the handler retrieves the recent edges of the left node specified in the request using the `graphHelper` object. It then maps each edge to a `RecentEdge` object with the corresponding `SocialProofType` based on the engagement type of the edge. The resulting sequence of `RecentEdge` objects is wrapped in a `GetRecentEdgesResponse` object and returned in a `Future`. 

The `RightNodeInfoHandler` class also takes in a `BipartiteGraphHelper` and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. It overrides the `apply` method of the `RequestHandler` trait, which takes in a `Long` representing the ID of the right node and returns a `Future` of `NodeInfo`. Within the `apply` method, the handler retrieves the edges of the right node specified using the `graphHelper` object. It then wraps the edges in a `NodeInfo` object and returns it in a `Future`. 

These handlers can be used in a larger project that involves a bipartite graph and a Thrift-defined service interface. The `LeftNodeEdgesHandler` can be used to retrieve recent edges of a left node, which can be useful for social proof or recommendation systems. The `RightNodeInfoHandler` can be used to retrieve information about a right node, such as its edges or metadata, which can be useful for user profiling or content analysis. These handlers can be integrated into a larger service that exposes these functionalities to clients through the Thrift interface. 

Example usage of `LeftNodeEdgesHandler`:
```
val graphHelper = new BipartiteGraphHelper()
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()
val handler = new LeftNodeEdgesHandler(graphHelper, statsReceiver)

val request = GetRecentEdgesRequest(requestId = 1234)
val responseFuture = handler.apply(request)

responseFuture.onSuccess { response =>
  response.recentEdges.foreach { edge =>
    println(s"Node ${edge.node} has engagement type ${edge.socialProofType}")
  }
}
```

Example usage of `RightNodeInfoHandler`:
```
val graphHelper = new BipartiteGraphHelper()
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()
val handler = new RightNodeInfoHandler(graphHelper, statsReceiver)

val rightNodeId = 5678
val nodeInfoFuture = handler.apply(rightNodeId)

nodeInfoFuture.onSuccess { nodeInfo =>
  println(s"Node $rightNodeId has ${nodeInfo.edges.size} edges")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an implementation of the Thrift-defined service interface for handling left node edges and right node info in a bipartite graph.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Finagle, ThriftScala, and Servo.

3. What are the different engagement types and how are they used in this code?
- The different engagement types are CLICK, FAVORITE, RETWEET, REPLY, and TWEET. They are used to determine the social proof type of recent edges in the left node edges handler.
