The `FinagleCounterWrapper` class is a wrapper for Twitter's Finagle Counter, which is used to track statistics in a distributed system. The purpose of this wrapper is to provide a similar interface for tracking stats in GraphJet, an open-source library that does not depend on Finagle.

The class takes in a `Counter` object from Finagle and implements the `GraphCounter` interface, which has two methods: `incr()` and `incr(delta: Int)`. These methods increment the counter by 1 and by a specified delta, respectively.

This wrapper can be used in the larger project to track statistics related to GraphJet's functionality. For example, it could be used to track the number of times a particular algorithm is run or the number of nodes visited during a graph traversal. By using a consistent interface for tracking stats, the project can easily switch between different implementations without having to change the code that uses the stats.

Here is an example of how the `FinagleCounterWrapper` could be used in the larger project:

```
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.DefaultStatsReceiver

val statsReceiver = DefaultStatsReceiver.get()
val finagleCounter = statsReceiver.counter("my_counter")
val graphCounter = new FinagleCounterWrapper(finagleCounter)

// Increment the counter by 1
graphCounter.incr()

// Increment the counter by 5
graphCounter.incr(5)
```

In this example, we first get the default stats receiver from Finagle and create a Finagle counter with the name "my_counter". We then create a `FinagleCounterWrapper` object with this counter and use it to increment the counter by 1 and by 5. The stats will be tracked using the Finagle stats system, but can be accessed using the `GraphCounter` interface provided by GraphJet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `FinagleCounterWrapper` that wraps Twitter's Finagle Counter and implements the `GraphCounter` interface.

2. What is the relationship between GraphJet and Finagle?
    
    GraphJet is an openly available library that does not depend on Finagle, but it tracks stats using a similar interface. This code is creating a wrapper class to bridge the gap between the two interfaces.

3. What methods are available in the `FinagleCounterWrapper` class?
    
    The `FinagleCounterWrapper` class has two methods: `incr()` and `incr(delta: Int)`. Both methods call the corresponding methods on the wrapped `Counter` object to increment the counter.
