[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/src/scala/com/twitter/recos/user_video_graph/LoggingUserVideoGraph.scala)

The code defines a trait called LoggingUserVideoGraph that extends the UserVideoGraph.MethodPerEndpoint trait from the thriftscala package. This trait is used to add logging functionality to the UserVideoGraph service. 

The accessLog variable is a logger object that is used to log access to the UserVideoGraph service. The logger is created using the Logger class from the com.twitter.logging package. 

The Trace and Future classes from the com.twitter.finagle.tracing and com.twitter.util packages respectively are also imported, but they are not used in this code. 

This code is likely a part of a larger project that includes a UserVideoGraph service. The LoggingUserVideoGraph trait can be mixed in with the UserVideoGraph service implementation to add logging functionality. For example:

```scala
class MyUserVideoGraphService extends UserVideoGraph.MethodPerEndpoint with LoggingUserVideoGraph {
  // implementation of UserVideoGraph service methods
}
```

In this example, the MyUserVideoGraphService class extends the UserVideoGraph.MethodPerEndpoint trait and mixes in the LoggingUserVideoGraph trait. This allows the service to log access using the accessLog logger defined in the LoggingUserVideoGraph trait. 

Overall, this code adds logging functionality to a UserVideoGraph service implementation and can be used to monitor access to the service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a trait called `LoggingUserVideoGraph` that extends the `UserVideoGraph.MethodPerEndpoint` trait from the `thriftscala` package. It's unclear how this fits into the larger project without more context.

2. What is the significance of the `Trace` and `Future` imports?
- The `Trace` import is from the `com.twitter.finagle.tracing` package and is likely used for distributed tracing. The `Future` import is from the `com.twitter.util` package and is likely used for asynchronous programming.

3. Why is there a private `accessLog` variable and how is it used?
- The `accessLog` variable is a private instance of the `Logger` class from the `com.twitter.logging` package. It's unclear how it's used without more context, but it's likely used for logging access to the user video graph.
