The `UserVideoGraphWriter` class is responsible for writing incoming data from Kafka to a multi-segment power-law bipartite graph. The class is initialized with several parameters, including the shard ID, environment, hostname, buffer size, Kafka consumer builder, client ID, and stats receiver. 

During service startup, the class submits a number of graph writer threads, `numBootstrapWriters`, which includes one live writer thread and `numBootstrapWriters - 1` catchup writer threads. All of these threads consume Kafka events from an internal concurrent queue, which is populated by Kafka reader threads. At bootstrap time, the Kafka reader threads look back at the Kafka offset from several hours ago and populate the internal concurrent queue. 

Each graph writer thread writes to an individual graph segment separately. The catchup writer threads will stop once all events between the current system time at startup and the time in memcache are processed. The live writer thread will continue to write all incoming Kafka events and will live through the entire life cycle of the Recos graph service. 

The `UserVideoGraphWriter` class implements two methods: `addEdgeToGraph` and `addEdgeToSegment`. The former is used by the live writer to insert edges to the current segment, while the latter is used by catchup writers to insert edges to non-current (old) segments. Both methods add a `RecosHoseMessage` to the graph or segment, respectively. 

The `getMetaEdge` method is a private helper method that takes a `rightId` and a `cardOption` and returns a `Long`. The `cardOption` is an optional byte that represents the type of card associated with the `rightId`. The method checks the type of card and returns the appropriate Tweet ID mask. 

Overall, the `UserVideoGraphWriter` class is an important component of the Recos graph service that handles the writing of incoming data from Kafka to a multi-segment power-law bipartite graph.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a class called UserVideoGraphWriter that submits a number of graph writer threads to consume Kafka events and write to individual graph segments. It solves the problem of processing and storing large amounts of data in a graph format.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Finagle, Finatra, Kafka, and GraphJet.

3. What is the significance of the variables `consumerNum` and `catchupWriterNum`?
- `consumerNum` is the number of Kafka consumer threads used for catch-up speed, while `catchupWriterNum` is the number of catch-up writer threads used to process events between system startup time and the time in memcache.
