The `RecosConfig` object holds all the configuration parameters for the `recos` graph. The `recos` graph is a multi-segment power law bipartite graph that is used to recommend videos to users on Twitter. The configuration parameters are used to build the graph and to ensure that it can handle the expected number of nodes and edges.

The configuration parameters include the maximum number of segments, the maximum number of edges per segment, the expected number of left nodes, the expected maximum left degree, the left power law exponent, the expected number of right nodes, the expected maximum right degree, and the right power law exponent. The left nodes represent the users on Twitter, and the right nodes represent the videos. The power law exponents determine the distribution of the degrees of the nodes. A steep power law exponent means that most nodes will have a small degree, while a less steep power law exponent means that some nodes will be very popular.

The `graphBuilderConfig` variable is an instance of the `GraphBuilderConfig` class, which is used to build the graph. The `GraphBuilderConfig` class takes the configuration parameters as arguments and sets them as properties of the class.

The `println` statements are used to print out the configuration parameters to the console. This is useful for debugging and for ensuring that the parameters are set correctly.

Overall, the `RecosConfig` object is an important part of the `recos` graph, as it ensures that the graph can handle the expected number of nodes and edges and that the distribution of the degrees of the nodes is appropriate for recommending videos to users on Twitter. An example of how this object may be used in the larger project is shown below:

```
import com.twitter.recos.user_video_graph.RecosConfig
import com.twitter.recos.graph_common.MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraphBuilder

val graphBuilder = new MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraphBuilder(RecoConfig.graphBuilderConfig)
val graph = graphBuilder.build()
```

In this example, the `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraphBuilder` class is used to build the `recos` graph using the configuration parameters from the `RecosConfig` object. The resulting graph can then be used to recommend videos to users on Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines the configuration parameters for a graph used in the Recos system at Twitter, which is used to recommend videos to users based on their viewing history.

2. What are the values of the configuration parameters and how were they determined?
- The configuration parameters include the maximum number of segments, maximum number of edges per segment, expected number of left and right nodes, expected maximum left and right degree, and power law exponents for left and right nodes. The values were likely determined through experimentation and analysis of the system's performance.

3. What is the significance of the print statements at the end of the code?
- The print statements output the values of the configuration parameters to the console, which could be useful for debugging or monitoring the system's behavior.
