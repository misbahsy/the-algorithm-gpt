The `GetAllInternalTweetIdsUtil` object provides a utility method to retrieve all internal tweet IDs associated with a given tweet ID in a bipartite graph. The purpose of this code is to support the recommendation system of The Algorithm from Twitter project by providing a list of related tweets to a given tweet ID.

The `getAllInternalTweetIds` method takes two parameters: a tweet ID and a bipartite graph. It first calls the `getAllMasks` method to retrieve all internal tweet IDs associated with the given tweet ID. The `getAllMasks` method returns a sequence of tweet IDs that includes the original tweet ID and four other tweet IDs that are derived from the original tweet ID using different masks. These masks are used to encode different types of tweets, such as summary, photo, player, and promotion tweets.

The `sortByDegrees` method takes the sequence of encoded tweet IDs and the bipartite graph as parameters. It first maps each encoded tweet ID to a tuple that contains the encoded tweet ID and its degree in the bipartite graph. It then filters out tweet IDs with a degree of 0 or less, as they are not related to the original tweet ID. Finally, it sorts the remaining tweet IDs by their degree in descending order and returns a sequence of encoded tweet IDs sorted by their degree.

The `getAllInternalTweetIds` method calls the `getAllMasks` method to retrieve all internal tweet IDs associated with the given tweet ID and then calls the `sortByDegrees` method to sort the internal tweet IDs by their degree in the bipartite graph. The resulting sequence of encoded tweet IDs represents related tweets to the original tweet ID, sorted by their relevance.

Example usage:
```
val tweetId: Long = 1234567890
val bipartiteGraph: BipartiteGraph = ...
val relatedTweetIds: Seq[Long] = GetAllInternalTweetIdsUtil.getAllInternalTweetIds(tweetId, bipartiteGraph)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a utility function for getting all internal tweet IDs related to a given tweet ID and sorting them by degree. A smart developer might want to know how this function is used in the larger project and what other components it interacts with.

2. What is the significance of the TweetIDMask class and how does it affect the output of this function?
- The TweetIDMask class is used to encode different types of tweet IDs, such as summary, photo, player, and promotion IDs. A smart developer might want to know how these different types of IDs are used in the larger project and how they affect the output of this function.

3. How does the sortByDegrees function work and why is it important for this utility function?
- The sortByDegrees function sorts the internal tweet IDs by their degree in descending order, which is important for identifying the most relevant and important IDs. A smart developer might want to know more about how the degree is calculated and why it is important for the larger project.
