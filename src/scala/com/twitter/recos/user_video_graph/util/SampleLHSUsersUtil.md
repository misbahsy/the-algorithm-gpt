The code defines a utility function called `sampleLHSUsers` that is used to sample user nodes from a bipartite graph. The function takes in three parameters: `maskedTweetId`, `maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor`, and `bipartiteGraph`. 

The `maskedTweetId` parameter is a unique identifier for a tweet that has been masked to protect user privacy. The `maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor` parameter specifies the maximum number of user nodes to sample for each neighbor of the tweet. Finally, the `bipartiteGraph` parameter is an instance of the `BipartiteGraph` class, which represents a bipartite graph with two types of nodes: left nodes (users) and right nodes (tweets).

The function first calls the `getRandomRightNodeEdges` method of the `bipartiteGraph` object to obtain an iterator over a random subset of the right nodes (tweets) that are adjacent to the `maskedTweetId`. The `maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor` parameter is used to limit the number of tweets that are sampled for each neighbor. The `new Random(System.currentTimeMillis)` argument is used to seed the random number generator used by the `getRandomRightNodeEdges` method.

The function then iterates over the sampled tweets and checks the degree of their left nodes (users) using the `getLeftNodeDegree` method of the `bipartiteGraph` object. If the degree is less than 100, the user node is added to a list of sampled user ids. The degree check is used to filter out users who like too many things, which may indicate spammy behavior.

The function returns the list of sampled user ids as a sequence of long integers.

This utility function is likely used in the larger project to sample user nodes from the bipartite graph for various purposes, such as training machine learning models or analyzing user behavior. An example usage of the function might look like this:

```
import com.twitter.recos.user_video_graph.util.SampleLHSUsersUtil
import com.twitter.graphjet.bipartite.InMemoryBipartiteGraph

val graph = new InMemoryBipartiteGraph()
// add nodes and edges to the graph

val maskedTweetId = 12345L
val maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor = 5
val sampledUserIds = SampleLHSUsersUtil.sampleLHSUsers(maskedTweetId, maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor, graph)

// do something with the sampled user ids
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to sample user nodes from a bipartite graph based on a given masked tweet ID and a maximum number of samples per neighbor.

2. What is the significance of the "100" value in the if statement?
- The "100" value is a threshold for the left node degree of a user. If a user has liked more than 100 things, their behavior may be considered spammy and they will not be included in the sampled user IDs.

3. What is the expected data type of the output of the `sampleLHSUsers` function?
- The expected data type of the output is a sequence of Long values representing the sampled user IDs.
