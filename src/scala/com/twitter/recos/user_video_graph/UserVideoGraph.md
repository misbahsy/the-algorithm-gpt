The `UserVideoGraph` class is a Scala implementation of a Thrift service that provides methods to retrieve related tweets for a given video. The class takes in three related tweet handlers (`tweetBasedRelatedTweetsHandler`, `producerBasedRelatedTweetsHandler`, and `consumersBasedRelatedTweetsHandler`) and an endpoint load shedder (`endpointLoadShedder`) as constructor arguments. 

The `UserVideoGraph` class extends the `thriftscala.UserVideoGraph.MethodPerEndpoint` trait, which defines the methods that can be called by a Thrift client. The three methods defined in this class are `tweetBasedRelatedTweets`, `producerBasedRelatedTweets`, and `consumersBasedRelatedTweets`. Each of these methods takes in a request object (`TweetBasedRelatedTweetRequest`, `ProducerBasedRelatedTweetRequest`, and `ConsumersBasedRelatedTweetRequest`, respectively) and returns a `Future` of a `RelatedTweetResponse` object.

Each of the three methods uses the `endpointLoadShedder` to wrap the corresponding related tweet handler method call. The `endpointLoadShedder` is a load shedding mechanism that can be used to prevent overloading the service. If the load shedder determines that the service is overloaded, it will return an empty response (`EmptyResponse`). If an exception is thrown during the method call, the log will record the exception and return an empty response.

The `UserVideoGraph` class also defines a `defaultTimeout` value of 50 milliseconds and a `log` object for logging exceptions. 

The `UserVideoGraph` object defines two methods: `traceId` and `clientId`. These methods return the current trace ID and client ID, respectively.

Overall, this code provides a Thrift service that can be used to retrieve related tweets for a given video. The load shedding mechanism helps prevent overloading the service, and the `traceId` and `clientId` methods can be used for tracing and debugging purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a class called `UserVideoGraph` that implements methods for handling related tweet requests based on different criteria. It also defines a companion object with utility methods for getting trace and client IDs.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including `finagle-thrift`, `finagle-tracing`, and `util-core` from Twitter, as well as `scala.concurrent.duration` from the Scala standard library.

3. What error handling mechanisms are in place for the methods defined in this class?
- Each method defined in this class uses an `EndpointLoadShedder` to handle load shedding and a default timeout of 50 milliseconds. If load shedding occurs, an empty response is returned. If any other exception is thrown, an error message is logged and an empty response is returned.
