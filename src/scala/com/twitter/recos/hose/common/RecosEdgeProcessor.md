The `RecosEdgeProcessor` class is a component of the larger Recos system, which is responsible for processing and analyzing user behavior data on Twitter. Specifically, this class processes `RecosHoseMessage` objects and inserts them as edges into a Recos graph. 

The `RecosEdgeProcessor` class takes an `EdgeCollector` object as a parameter, which is responsible for collecting and storing edges in the Recos graph. The `process` method takes a `ConsumerRecord` object containing a `RecosHoseMessage` and returns a `Future` of type `Unit`. 

Inside the `process` method, the `scopedStats` object is used to create counters for tracking the number of events processed, null pointer exceptions, and processing errors. The `processEventsCounter` counter is incremented every time the `process` method is called. If the `RecosHoseMessage` object is not null, the `edgeCollector` object's `addEdge` method is called to add the message as an edge to the Recos graph. If the `RecosHoseMessage` object is null, the `nullPointerEventCounter` counter is incremented. If an exception is thrown during processing, the `errorCounter` counter is incremented and the exception is printed to the console. 

This class can be used in conjunction with other components of the Recos system to build and analyze a graph of user behavior data. For example, the `EdgeCollector` object could be used in conjunction with a `VertexCollector` object to build a complete graph of user behavior data. Once the graph is built, it could be analyzed using algorithms such as PageRank or community detection to identify influential users or groups of users. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.recos.hose.common.RecosEdgeProcessor
import com.twitter.recos.hose.common.EdgeCollector
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.NullStatsReceiver
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord

// create an EdgeCollector object
val edgeCollector = new EdgeCollector()

// create a RecosEdgeProcessor object
val recosEdgeProcessor = RecosEdgeProcessor(edgeCollector)(NullStatsReceiver)

// create a ConsumerRecord object containing a RecosHoseMessage
val message = new RecosHoseMessage(...)
val record = new ConsumerRecord[String, RecosHoseMessage]("topic", 0, 0, "key", message)

// process the message using the RecosEdgeProcessor object
recosEdgeProcessor.process(record)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the RecosEdgeProcessor class?
- The RecosEdgeProcessor class processes RecosHoseMessage and inserts the message as an edge into a recos graph.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.recos.internal.thriftscala.RecosHoseMessage, com.twitter.util.Future, and org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord libraries.

3. What kind of errors does the process method handle?
- The process method handles any Throwable errors that may occur during the processing of the message, and increments the errorCounter and prints the stack trace.
