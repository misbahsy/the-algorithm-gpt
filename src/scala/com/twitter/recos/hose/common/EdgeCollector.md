The `BufferedEdgeCollector` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It is responsible for consuming incoming edges and inserting them into a buffer of a specified size. Once the buffer is full, it is written to a concurrently linked queue where the size is bounded by a semaphore. 

The `EdgeCollector` trait defines a single method `addEdge` which takes a `RecosHoseMessage` object and adds it to the buffer. The `BufferedEdgeCollector` class implements this trait and overrides the `addEdge` method to add the message to the buffer. If the buffer is full, the contents of the buffer are added to the queue and a new buffer is created. 

The `BufferedEdgeCollector` class takes four parameters: `bufferSize`, `queue`, `queuelimit`, and `statsReceiver`. `bufferSize` specifies the size of the buffer, `queue` is the queue where the buffer is added, `queuelimit` is a semaphore that limits the size of the queue, and `statsReceiver` is used to collect statistics about the queue.

The `buffer` variable is an array of `RecosHoseMessage` objects that is initialized to the size of `bufferSize`. The `index` variable keeps track of the current index in the buffer. When a new message is added to the buffer, it is added at the current index and the index is incremented. If the index is greater than or equal to `bufferSize`, the contents of the buffer are added to the queue and a new buffer is created.

The `Stat.time` method is used to time how long it takes to acquire the semaphore. The `queueAddCounter` is used to count the number of times the buffer is added to the queue.

Overall, the `BufferedEdgeCollector` class is a useful component for buffering incoming edges and adding them to a queue. It can be used in a larger project to efficiently handle large amounts of data. 

Example usage:

```
val queue = new java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue[Array[RecosHoseMessage]]()
val semaphore = new Semaphore(10)
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()

val collector = new BufferedEdgeCollector(100, queue, semaphore, statsReceiver)

val message = new RecosHoseMessage()
collector.addEdge(message)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EdgeCollector` trait?
- The `EdgeCollector` trait defines a method `addEdge` that is used to add incoming edges to a buffer.

2. What is the purpose of the `BufferedEdgeCollector` class?
- The `BufferedEdgeCollector` class consumes incoming edges and inserts them into a buffer of a specified bufferSize. Once the buffer is full of edges, it is written to a concurrently linked queue where the size is bounded by queuelimit.

3. What is the purpose of the `queueAddCounter` and `waitEnqueue` stats in the `BufferedEdgeCollector` class?
- The `queueAddCounter` is used to keep track of the number of times the buffer is added to the queue. The `waitEnqueue` stat is used to measure the time it takes to acquire a permit from the `queuelimit` semaphore.
