The `BufferedEdgeWriter` class is responsible for reading a buffer of edges from a queue and inserting each edge into the recos graph. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing large amounts of data and generating recommendations based on that data.

The `BufferedEdgeWriter` class takes in several parameters: a queue of `RecosHoseMessage` arrays, a semaphore that limits the size of the queue, an `EdgeCollector` object, a `StatsReceiver` object, and a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the thread is still running. The `EdgeCollector` object is responsible for actually adding the edges to the recos graph.

The `run` method of the `BufferedEdgeWriter` class contains a loop that runs as long as the `isRunning` function returns true. Within the loop, the class attempts to remove a batch of edges from the queue using the `poll` method. If the queue is not empty, the edges are removed from the batch one by one and added to the recos graph using the `addEdge` method of the `EdgeCollector` object. If the queue is empty, the thread sleeps for 100 milliseconds before attempting to read from the queue again.

The `BufferedEdgeWriter` class also contains two counters that are used to track the number of times the queue is emptied and the number of times the thread sleeps due to an empty queue. These counters are used to generate statistics about the performance of the system.

Overall, the `BufferedEdgeWriter` class plays an important role in the larger project by efficiently processing large amounts of data and adding edges to the recos graph. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes and functions to generate recommendations based on the data in the graph.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code reads a buffer of edges from a queue and inserts each edge into a graph. It solves the problem of efficiently processing a large number of edges in a concurrent environment.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the Finagle library for stats tracking and the ThriftScala library for the RecosHoseMessage class.

3. How does this code handle errors or exceptions?
- There is no explicit error handling in this code. If an exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack. The logger is used to log when the BufferedEdgeWriter thread is done.
