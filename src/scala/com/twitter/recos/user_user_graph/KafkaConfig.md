The code defines a Scala object called KafkaConfig that holds configuration parameters for a Kafka queue. Specifically, it sets the size of the RecosHoseMessage array that is written to the concurrently linked queue. The buffer size is set to 64, which is chosen to keep the throughput around 6 seconds. This is lower than the young gen garbage collection cycle of 20 seconds, so that all incoming messages will be garbage collected in the young gen instead of the old gen.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves processing data from a Kafka queue. By setting the buffer size to an appropriate value, the project can optimize the throughput of the queue while minimizing the impact on garbage collection. Other parts of the project may reference this KafkaConfig object to access its configuration parameters.

Here is an example of how the KafkaConfig object might be used in a larger project:

```
import com.twitter.recos.user_user_graph.KafkaConfig

val bufferSize = KafkaConfig.bufferSize
println(s"Using buffer size of $bufferSize for Kafka queue")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a configuration object for a Kafka queue in a user-user graph recommendation system.

2. What is the significance of the `bufferSize` variable?
- The `bufferSize` variable determines the size of the `RecosHoseMessage` array that is written to the queue. It is set to 64 to maintain a throughput of around 6 seconds, which is lower than the young gen gc cycle of 20 seconds, ensuring that all incoming messages will be garbage collected in the young gen instead of the old gen.

3. Why is there a `println` statement in the `KafkaConfig` object?
- The `println` statement is used to output the value of the `bufferSize` variable to the console, likely for debugging or monitoring purposes.
