The `RecommendUsersHandlerImpl` class is responsible for computing user recommendations based on a `RecommendUserRequest` by using the TopSecondDegree algorithm in GraphJet. This class implements the `RecommendUsersHandler` trait, which defines a method `apply` that takes a `RecommendUserRequest` and returns a `Future` of `RecommendUserResponse`.

The `RecommendUsersHandlerImpl` class has several private variables that are used to track statistics related to the recommendations. It also has a private `log` variable that is used for logging errors. The `graphJetQueue` variable is an asynchronous queue of `TopSecondDegreeByCountForUser` objects that are used to compute recommendations. The number of `TopSecondDegreeByCountForUser` objects in the queue is determined by the `numSalsaRunners` parameter in the `salsaRunnerConfig` object.

The `convertRequestToJava` method takes a `RecommendUserRequest` and converts it to a `TopSecondDegreeByCountRequestForUser` object, which is used by GraphJet to compute recommendations. The `convertMinUserPerSocialProofToJava` method converts the `minUserPerSocialProof` parameter in the `RecommendUserRequest` to the Java equivalent. The `convertSocialProofsToScala` method converts the social proofs in the Java format to the Scala equivalent. The `convertResponseToScala` method converts the Java recommendation results to the Scala equivalent.

The `getGraphJetResponse` method takes a `TopSecondDegreeByCountForUser` object, a `TopSecondDegreeByCountRequestForUser` object, and a `Random` object, and returns an `Option` of `TopSecondDegreeByCountResponse`. This method computes the recommendations using GraphJet and catches any exceptions that occur during the computation.

The `apply` method takes a `RecommendUserRequest` and returns a `Future` of `RecommendUserResponse`. This method polls the `graphJetQueue` for a `TopSecondDegreeByCountForUser` object, computes the recommendations using GraphJet, and returns the recommendations as a `RecommendUserResponse`. If the polling times out, the method immediately puts the `TopSecondDegreeByCountForUser` object back into the queue and throws a `RuntimeException`.

Overall, the `RecommendUsersHandlerImpl` class provides a way to compute user recommendations using the TopSecondDegree algorithm in GraphJet. It takes a `RecommendUserRequest` as input and returns a `RecommendUserResponse` as output. This class is likely used as part of a larger project that involves recommending users to other users on Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code computes user recommendations based on a RecommendUserRequest by using the TopSecondDegree algorithm in GraphJet.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on various libraries such as Google Guava, Twitter Finagle, and Fastutil.

3. What is the role of the UserUserGraphDecider and how does it affect the recommendations?
- The UserUserGraphDecider is a component that decides whether to include or exclude a user from the recommendations based on certain criteria. It affects the recommendations by filtering out users that do not meet the criteria.
