The `UserEdgeTypeMask` class is used to encode edge types in the top bits of an integer. This implementation is used in the `com.twitter.recos.user_user_graph` package of the larger project. The package is responsible for creating a user-user graph, which is a graph of users and their relationships with other users. The `UserEdgeTypeMask` class is used to encode the type of relationship between two users, such as Follow, Mention, and Mediatag. 

The `UserEdgeTypeMask` class is a subclass of `EdgeTypeMask`, which is an interface that defines methods for encoding and decoding edge types. The `UserEdgeTypeMask` class overrides the `encode`, `edgeType`, and `restore` methods of the `EdgeTypeMask` interface. The `encode` method takes a node and an edge type as arguments and returns an integer that encodes the node and edge type. The `edgeType` method takes an integer that encodes a node and an edge type and returns the edge type. The `restore` method takes an integer that encodes a node and an edge type and returns the node.

The `UserEdgeTypeMask` class also defines several constants and an array. The `MASK` constant is an integer that is used to mask the lower 27 bits of an integer, leaving the top 5 bits to encode the edge type. The `FOLLOW`, `MENTION`, and `MEDIATAG` constants are bytes that represent the edge types Follow, Mention, and Mediatag, respectively. The `SIZE` constant is a byte that represents the number of edge types. The `EDGEARRAY` array is an array of integers that is used to encode the edge types. Each element of the array is an integer that encodes an edge type.

The `getUserUserGraphSocialProofTypes` method is a static method that takes an optional sequence of `UserSocialProofType` objects as an argument and returns an array of bytes that represent the valid social proof types. If the argument is `None`, the method returns an array of bytes that represent all available social proof types. The method maps the `UserSocialProofType` objects to their corresponding byte values and returns an array of bytes.

Overall, the `UserEdgeTypeMask` class is used to encode the type of relationship between two users in the user-user graph. The class is used in the `com.twitter.recos.user_user_graph` package of the larger project. The `getUserUserGraphSocialProofTypes` method is used to map social proof types to their corresponding byte values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `UserEdgeTypeMask` that extends `EdgeTypeMask` and is used to encode edge types in the top bits of an integer. It also defines a companion object that contains some constants and a method to map valid social proof types to an array of bytes.

2. What are the edge types that can be encoded using this implementation?
- The edge types that can be encoded using this implementation are `FOLLOW`, `MENTION`, and `MEDIATAG`.

3. What is the significance of the `MASK` constant?
- The `MASK` constant is used to mask out the top four bits of an integer, which are used to encode the edge type information. It is defined as `00001111111111111111111111111111` in binary, which means that the lower 28 bits are set to 1 and the top 4 bits are set to 0.
