The code defines an object called `RecosConfig` that holds all the configuration parameters for a graph used in the `user_user_graph` package of the Twitter recommendation system. The graph is a bipartite graph with left and right nodes, where the left nodes represent users and the right nodes represent other users that the left nodes are connected to. 

The configuration parameters include the maximum number of segments that the graph can have, the maximum number of edges per segment, the expected number of left and right nodes, the expected maximum degree of the left nodes, and the power law exponent for the left nodes. The power law exponent is set to 16.0, which means that most nodes will have a small degree, and only a few nodes will have a large degree. 

The configuration also includes the number of right node metadata types, which is set to 1 because the graph does not have any right node metadata. The `GraphBuilderConfig` class is used to store the configuration parameters, and an instance of this class is created with the configuration parameters. 

The code also prints out the configuration parameters to the console using `println` statements. This is useful for debugging and verifying that the configuration parameters are set correctly. 

Overall, this code sets the configuration parameters for a bipartite graph used in the Twitter recommendation system. The configuration parameters are used to create an instance of the `GraphBuilderConfig` class, which is used to build the graph. The `RecosConfig` object provides a centralized location for storing and accessing the configuration parameters. 

Example usage:

```scala
// Accessing the configuration parameters
val maxNumSegments = RecosConfig.maxNumSegments
val leftPowerLawExponent = RecosConfig.leftPowerLawExponent

// Creating an instance of GraphBuilderConfig with the configuration parameters
val graphBuilderConfig = RecosConfig.graphBuilderConfig
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RecosConfig` object?
- The `RecosConfig` object holds all the configuration parameters for the `recos` graph.
2. What is the significance of the `maxNumEdgesPerSegment` parameter?
- The `maxNumEdgesPerSegment` parameter sets the maximum number of edges that can be stored in each segment of the bipartite graph builder.
3. What is the purpose of the `println` statements at the end of the object?
- The `println` statements output the values of the configuration parameters to the console for debugging and monitoring purposes.
