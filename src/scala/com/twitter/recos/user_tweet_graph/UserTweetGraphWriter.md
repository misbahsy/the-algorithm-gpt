The `UserTweetGraphWriter` class is responsible for writing incoming Kafka events to a multi-segment power-law bipartite graph. The class is initialized with a number of parameters including the shard ID, environment, hostname, buffer size, Kafka consumer builder, client ID, and stats receiver. 

During service startup, a number of graph writer threads are submitted, where one of them is a live writer thread and the others are catchup writer threads. All of these threads consume Kafka events from an internal concurrent queue, which is populated by Kafka reader threads. At bootstrap time, the Kafka reader threads look back at the Kafka offset from several hours ago and populate the internal concurrent queue. Each graph writer thread writes to an individual graph segment separately. The catchup writer threads will stop once all events between the current system time at startup and the time in memcache are processed. The live writer thread will continue to write all incoming Kafka events and will live through the entire life cycle of the Recos graph service.

The class has two methods, `addEdgeToGraph` and `addEdgeToSegment`, which are used to add a `RecosHoseMessage` to the graph. The `addEdgeToGraph` method is used by the live writer to insert edges to the current segment, while the `addEdgeToSegment` method is used by catchup writers to insert edges to non-current (old) segments. Both methods check if the action of the `RecosHoseMessage` is either a favorite or a retweet before adding the edge to the graph.

The `getMetaEdge` method is a private helper method that takes a `rightId` and a `cardOption` as input and returns a `Long`. The method checks if the `cardOption` is a photo card, player card, summary card, or promotion card, and returns the corresponding `TweetIDMask` value for the `rightId`. If the `cardOption` is not one of these types, the method returns the `rightId`.

Overall, the `UserTweetGraphWriter` class is an important component of the Recos graph service that handles the writing of incoming Kafka events to a multi-segment power-law bipartite graph.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a class called `UserTweetGraphWriter` that submits a number of graph writer threads to consume Kafka events and write to individual graph segments. It solves the problem of processing and storing user-tweet interactions in a graph format.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.finatra.kafka.consumers.FinagleKafkaConsumerBuilder`, and `com.twitter.graphjet.algorithms.TweetIDMask`.

3. What is the role of the `addEdgeToGraph` and `addEdgeToSegment` methods?
- The `addEdgeToGraph` method is used by the live writer to insert edges to the current graph segment, while the `addEdgeToSegment` method is used by catch-up writers to insert edges to non-current (old) segments. Both methods add a `RecosHoseMessage` to the graph with specific conditions.
