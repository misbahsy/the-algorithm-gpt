The `UserRecentFollowersStore` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to retrieve recent followers of a given user. It takes in a `SocialGraphService` client as a parameter and implements the `ReadableStore` trait with a `get` method that returns a `Future` of an optional sequence of `UserId`s. 

The `get` method takes in a `Query` object that contains the `userId` of the user whose recent followers are to be retrieved, the `maxResults` parameter that specifies the maximum number of recent followers to be returned, and the `maxAge` parameter that specifies the maximum age of the recent followers to be returned. 

Inside the `get` method, an `EdgesRequest` object is created with the `SrcRelationship` set to the given `userId` and `RelationshipType` set to `FollowedBy`. The `PageRequest` is set to the `maxResults` parameter if it is not `None`. 

The `lookbackThresholdMillis` variable is set to the difference between the current time and the `maxAge` parameter if it is not `None`, otherwise it is set to 0. 

The `edges` method of the `sgsClient` is called with the `Seq` of `edgeRequest`s and the result is mapped to a sequence of `UserId`s that are filtered based on the `lookbackThresholdMillis` value. Finally, the result is wrapped in an `Option` and returned as a `Future`. 

This class can be used in the larger project to retrieve recent followers of a user for various purposes such as recommending new users to follow or analyzing user behavior. 

Example usage:
```
val sgsClient = new SocialGraphService.MethodPerEndpoint(...) // create client
val userRecentFollowersStore = new UserRecentFollowersStore(sgsClient) // create store

val query = UserRecentFollowersStore.Query(userId = "12345", maxResults = Some(10), maxAge = Some(Duration.fromMinutes(30)))
val recentFollowersFuture = userRecentFollowersStore.get(query) // retrieve recent followers

recentFollowersFuture.foreach {
  case Some(recentFollowers) => println(recentFollowers)
  case None => println("No recent followers found")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `UserRecentFollowersStore` that implements a `ReadableStore` interface and retrieves recent followers of a user from a social graph service.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common.UserId`, `com.twitter.socialgraph.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.storehaus.ReadableStore`, `com.twitter.util.Duration`, `com.twitter.util.Future`, and `com.twitter.util.Time`.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is an optional sequence of user IDs representing recent followers of a given user, based on the specified query parameters.
