The `FetchRHSTweetsUtil` object in the `com.twitter.recos.user_tweet_graph.util` package contains a single method called `fetchRHSTweets`. This method takes in three parameters: a sequence of user IDs (`userIds`), a `BipartiteGraph` object (`bipartiteGraph`), and a set of allowed actions (`allowedActions`). The purpose of this method is to retrieve the right-hand-side (RHS) tweets associated with the given user IDs.

The method first converts the set of allowed actions into a set of strings (`allowedActionStrings`). It then iterates over the distinct user IDs in the input sequence using the `flatMap` method. For each user ID, it retrieves an iterator of the edges that connect the user to the tweets they have interacted with using the `getLeftNodeEdges` method of the `bipartiteGraph` object. This iterator is of type `MultiSegmentIterator[BipartiteGraphSegment]`, which is a specialized iterator that can traverse multiple segments of a bipartite graph.

The method then initializes an empty `ListBuffer` object called `tweetIds` and checks if the iterator is not null. If it is not null, the method iterates over the edges using a while loop. For each edge, it retrieves the ID of the right-hand-side node (i.e., the tweet ID) using the `nextLong` method of the iterator. It also retrieves the type of the edge using the `currentEdgeType` method of the iterator. If the string representation of the edge type is contained in the set of allowed action strings, the tweet ID is added to the `tweetIds` list.

Finally, the method returns a sequence of distinct tweet IDs by calling the `distinct` method on the `tweetIds` list.

This method is likely used in the larger project to retrieve the tweets that are most relevant to a given set of users based on their interactions with the tweets. For example, this method could be used to power a recommendation engine that suggests tweets to users based on their past behavior. Here is an example usage of this method:

```
val userIds = Seq(123, 456, 789)
val bipartiteGraph = // initialize bipartite graph object
val allowedActions = Set(Action.LIKE, Action.RETWEET)
val rhsTweets = FetchRHSTweetsUtil.fetchRHSTweets(userIds, bipartiteGraph, allowedActions)
println(rhsTweets) // prints a sequence of tweet IDs
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a utility function for fetching tweets from a bipartite graph given a set of user IDs and allowed actions. It likely serves as a helper function for some other part of the project that needs to retrieve tweets for a given set of users.

2. What is the expected format of the input parameters userIds and allowedActions?
- userIds is expected to be a sequence of Long integers representing user IDs. allowedActions is expected to be a set of values from the Action enumeration. It is unclear from this code snippet what specific actions are allowed and how they are defined.

3. What is the purpose of the UserTweetEdgeTypeMask function and how is it used?
- UserTweetEdgeTypeMask is used to extract the edge type from a bipartite graph edge and convert it to a string representation. This string representation is then checked against the set of allowed action strings to determine if the edge should be included in the output. It is unclear from this code snippet how the UserTweetEdgeTypeMask function is defined and what specific edge types it is used to extract.
