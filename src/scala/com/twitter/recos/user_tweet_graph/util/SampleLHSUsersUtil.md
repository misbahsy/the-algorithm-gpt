The `SampleLHSUsersUtil` object in this file contains a single method called `sampleLHSUsers`. This method takes in three parameters: a `maskedTweetId` of type `Long`, an `maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor` of type `Int`, and a `bipartiteGraph` of type `BipartiteGraph`. The purpose of this method is to sample a set of user IDs that have interacted with a given tweet ID in a bipartite graph.

The method first calls the `getRandomRightNodeEdges` method on the `bipartiteGraph` object, passing in the `maskedTweetId`, `maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor`, and a new `Random` object seeded with the current system time. This method returns an iterator over the sampled user IDs that have interacted with the tweet ID.

The method then initializes an empty `ListBuffer` object called `userIds`. It iterates over the sampled user IDs returned by the iterator, checking if the left node (i.e. the user ID) has a degree less than 100 in the bipartite graph. If the degree is less than 100, the user ID is added to the `userIds` list.

Finally, the method returns the `userIds` list as a sequence of `Long` values.

This method can be used in the larger project to sample a set of users who have interacted with a given tweet. This can be useful for various tasks such as recommending similar tweets to these users or analyzing their behavior. Here is an example usage of this method:

```
import com.twitter.recos.user_tweet_graph.util.SampleLHSUsersUtil
import com.twitter.graphjet.bipartite.{BipartiteGraph, LeftIndexedBipartiteGraph}

val bipartiteGraph: BipartiteGraph = new LeftIndexedBipartiteGraph()
// add nodes and edges to bipartiteGraph

val maskedTweetId: Long = 123456789
val maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor: Int = 10

val sampledUserIds: Seq[Long] = SampleLHSUsersUtil.sampleLHSUsers(maskedTweetId, maxNumSamplesPerNeighbor, bipartiteGraph)

// do something with the sampledUserIds
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to sample user nodes from a bipartite graph based on a given masked tweet ID and a maximum number of samples per neighbor.

2. What is the significance of the `100` value in the `if` statement?
- The `100` value is a threshold for the left node degree of a user. If a user has liked more than 100 things, their behavior may be considered spammy and they will not be included in the sampled user IDs.

3. What is the data type of the returned value from the `sampleLHSUsers` function?
- The returned value from the `sampleLHSUsers` function is a sequence of `Long` values representing the sampled user IDs.
