The `UserMass` object in the `com.twitter.graph.batch.job.tweepcred` package is a helper class that calculates the mass of a Twitter user. The mass of a user is a measure of their influence on the platform, and it is used in various algorithms to rank users or identify influential users. The `UserMass` object provides a `getUserMass` method that takes a `CombinedUser` object as input and returns an `Option[UserMassInfo]` object.

The `CombinedUser` object contains information about a Twitter user, including their profile information, extended profile information, and safety status. The `getUserMass` method extracts relevant information from the `CombinedUser` object, such as the user ID, age, number of followers and followings, and safety status. It then calculates the user's mass using a formula that takes into account various factors such as the user's age, device usage, and safety status.

The `UserMass` object defines several constants that are used in the mass calculation formula, such as the threshold values for the number of friends and followers, the weight additives for device usage and age, and the weight multiplicative for restricted users. The mass calculation formula uses these constants to adjust the user's mass based on their profile information.

The `UserMass` object returns an `Option[UserMassInfo]` object, which contains the user ID and their calculated mass. If the user is not valid (e.g., deactivated or suspended), the method returns `None`.

This `UserMass` object is used in the larger project to calculate the mass of Twitter users and rank them based on their influence. The mass calculation is used in various algorithms to identify influential users, recommend users to follow, or detect spam or bot accounts. For example, the mass calculation can be used in a recommendation system to suggest users with high mass to follow, or in a spam detection system to flag users with low mass as suspicious. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.graph.batch.job.tweepcred.UserMass
import com.twitter.twadoop.user.gen.CombinedUser

val combinedUser: CombinedUser = // get a CombinedUser object
val userMassInfoOpt: Option[UserMassInfo] = UserMass.getUserMass(combinedUser)
userMassInfoOpt.foreach { userMassInfo =>
  println(s"User ID: ${userMassInfo.userId}, Mass: ${userMassInfo.mass}")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a helper class used to calculate user mass for a Twitter project.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `getUserMass` function?
- The input is a `CombinedUser` object, and the output is an `Option` of a `UserMassInfo` object.

3. What are the constants and variables used in the calculation of user mass?
- The constants used are `constantDivisionFactorGt_threshFriendsToFollowersRatioUMass`, `threshAbsNumFriendsUMass`, `threshFriendsToFollowersRatioUMass`, `deviceWeightAdditive`, `ageWeightAdditive`, and `restrictedWeightMultiplicative`. The variables used are `userId`, `age`, `isRestricted`, `isSuspended`, `isVerified`, `hasValidDevice`, `numFollowers`, and `numFollowings`.
