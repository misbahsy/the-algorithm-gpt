The `PreparePageRankData` class is responsible for preparing the graph data for page rank calculation and generating the initial page rank as the starting point. It also starts the `WeightedPageRank` job. The class reads either a TSV file for testing or reads the flock edges and real graph input for weights to build the graph. The class has several options, including the working directory, whether to do weighted page rank, whether to restrict the graph to flock edges, and where to put the page rank and tweepcred files. 

The `getFlockEdges` method reads the flock edges, while the `getRealGraphEdges` method reads the real graph edges with weights. The `getFlockRealGraphEdges` method combines the real graph and flock. If `flock_edges_only` is true, only the flock edges are taken; otherwise, edges are either from flock or from the real graph. The edges' weights default to be 1, overwritten by weights from the real graph. 

The `getUserMass` method computes the user mass based on the combined user. The `getGraphData` method reads either flock/real_graph or a given TSV file, groups by the source id, and outputs the node data structure. It merges with the user mass and returns `<'src_id, 'dst_ids, 'weights, 'mass_prior>`. The `generateInitialPagerank` method outputs prior mass or copies the given mass file (merge, normalize) to be used as the starting point. 

The `PreparePageRankData` class is used in the larger project to prepare the graph data for page rank calculation and generate the initial page rank as the starting point. It is a crucial step in the page rank calculation process. The class can be used by calling its constructor and passing the appropriate arguments. For example:

```
val args = Args(Array("--pwd", "/path/to/working/directory", "--weighted", "true"))
val preparePageRankData = new PreparePageRankData(args)
```

This creates a new instance of the `PreparePageRankData` class with the working directory set to `/path/to/working/directory` and `weighted` set to `true`. The `generateInitialPagerank` method will generate the initial page rank, and the `next` method will start the `WeightedPageRank` job.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code prepares graph data for page rank calculation and generates the initial pagerank as the starting point. It can read either a tsv file for testing or read flock edges and real graph input for weights. It also has options for weighted pagerank, restricting the graph to flock edges, and continuing pagerank from a given input pagerank file.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including com.twitter.data.proto.Flock, com.twitter.scalding, com.twitter.pluck.source, com.twitter.pluck.source.combined_user_source.MostRecentCombinedUserSnapshotSource, com.twitter.scalding_internal.dalv2.DAL, and graphstore.common.FlockFollowsJavaDataset.

3. What are the optional arguments for this code and what do they do?
- The optional arguments for this code include input, weighted, flock_edges_only, input_pagerank, output_pagerank, output_tweepcred, maxiterations, jumpprob, threshold, and post_adjust. They allow the user to specify a tsv file for input, choose whether to use weighted pagerank, restrict the graph to flock edges, continue pagerank from a given input pagerank file, specify output files for pagerank and tweepcred, set maximum iterations, set probability of a random jump, set a threshold for early finishing, and choose whether to do post adjust.
