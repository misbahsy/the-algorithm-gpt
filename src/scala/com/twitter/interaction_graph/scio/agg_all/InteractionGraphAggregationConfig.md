The code defines a Scala object called `InteractionGraphScoringConfig` that contains two constant values: `ALPHA` and `ONE_MINUS_ALPHA`. These constants are used to compute a variant of the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for scoring interactions in a social media platform like Twitter.

The EWMA is a statistical method that calculates the average of a series of data points over time, giving more weight to recent data points and less weight to older ones. This is useful for tracking trends and detecting anomalies in time-series data. The formula for computing the EWMA is:

    ewma_{t+1} = x_{t+1} * alpha + ewma_t * (1 - alpha)

where `x_{t+1}` is the value of the data point at time `t+1`, `ewma_t` is the EWMA at time `t`, and `alpha` is a smoothing factor that determines the weight given to the new data point relative to the previous EWMA. A higher value of `alpha` gives more weight to recent data points, while a lower value gives more weight to older ones.

In this case, the code uses a variant of the EWMA where the new data point is added to the previous EWMA without down-weighting it. This means that the EWMA only decays as the data points grow older, but the average value is not computed. The value of `ALPHA` is set to 1.0, which means that the new data point has the same weight as the previous EWMA. The value of `ONE_MINUS_ALPHA` is set to 0.955, which means that the half-life of the weights is 7 days. This means that the weight given to a data point decreases by half every 7 days.

This code is likely used in the larger project to score interactions between users on a social media platform like Twitter. The EWMA is a common method for scoring interactions based on factors like frequency, recency, and relevance. By using a variant of the EWMA with a fixed half-life, the code can assign scores to interactions that decay over time, reflecting the changing nature of social interactions. For example, a retweet or a like may have a high score initially, but its score will decrease over time as newer interactions take place. The constants defined in this code can be used to fine-tune the scoring algorithm based on the specific needs of the platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines two constants, ALPHA and ONE_MINUS_ALPHA, for a variant of the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average used in computing interaction graph scores.

2. How is the value of ALPHA chosen?
- ALPHA is chosen such that the half life of weights is 7 days.

3. Why is x_{t+1} not down-weighted in this variant of EWMA?
- x_{t+1} is not down-weighted because the goal is to decay actions as they grow old, not compute the average value.
