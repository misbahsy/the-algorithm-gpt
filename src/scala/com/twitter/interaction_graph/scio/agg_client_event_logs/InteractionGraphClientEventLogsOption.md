This code defines a trait called InteractionGraphClientEventLogsOption that extends two other traits: DALOptions and DateRangeOptions. The purpose of this trait is to provide options for configuring the Interaction Graph client event logs aggregation job in the larger project.

The DALOptions trait provides options for configuring the Data Access Layer (DAL) used by the job, while the DateRangeOptions trait provides options for specifying a date range for the job to process.

The InteractionGraphClientEventLogsOption trait adds three additional options to the job configuration:
- OutputPath: A required option that specifies the path where the final dataset should be stored.
- DALWriteEnvironment: An optional option that specifies the DAL write environment. The default value is "PROD", but it can be set to "dev" or "stg" for local validation.
- NumberOfShards: An optional option that specifies the number of shards/partitions for saving the final dataset. The default value is 16.

These options can be set using command-line arguments or a configuration file, and they allow the job to be customized for different environments and use cases.

Here is an example of how these options might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import com.twitter.interaction_graph.scio.agg_client_event_logs.InteractionGraphClientEventLogsOption

// Define the job options
val options = PipelineOptionsFactory.fromArgs(args).withValidation().as(classOf[InteractionGraphClientEventLogsOption])

// Set the output path
options.setOutputPath("gs://my-bucket/output")

// Set the DAL write environment to "dev"
options.setDALWriteEnvironment("dev")

// Set the number of shards to 32
options.setNumberOfShards(32)

// Create the pipeline using the options
val pipeline = Pipeline.create(options)
``` 

In this example, we create a new instance of the InteractionGraphClientEventLogsOption trait using command-line arguments, and then we set the output path to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, the DAL write environment to "dev", and the number of shards to 32. Finally, we create a new pipeline using these options.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a trait called `InteractionGraphClientEventLogsOption` which extends two other traits and defines several options for storing and processing data.

2. What are the dependencies for this code?
   - This code depends on `com.twitter.beam.io.dal.DALOptions`, `com.twitter.beam.job.DateRangeOptions`, and `org.apache.beam.sdk.options` packages.

3. What is the significance of the `@Required` and `@Default` annotations in this code?
   - The `@Required` annotation indicates that the `getOutputPath` method must be provided with a value, while the `@Default` annotation sets a default value for the `getDALWriteEnvironment` and `getNumberOfShards` methods if no value is provided.
