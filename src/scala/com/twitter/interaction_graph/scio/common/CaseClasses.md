The code defines several case classes that are used in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of these case classes is to define a common type for edge/vertex feature calculation in the Interaction Graph. 

The `InteractionGraphRawInput` case class has five fields: `src`, `dst`, `name`, `age`, and `featureValue`. `src` and `dst` represent the source and destination IDs of the relationship, `name` represents the name of the feature being calculated, `age` represents the age of the relationship in days, and `featureValue` represents the value to be aggregated. This case class is used to store raw input data for the Interaction Graph.

The `FeatureKey` case class has three fields: `src`, `dest`, and `name`. `src` and `dest` represent the source and destination IDs of the relationship, and `name` represents the name of the feature being calculated. This case class is used as a key for storing and retrieving feature values in the Interaction Graph.

The `Tweepcred` case class has two fields: `userId` and `tweepcred`. `userId` represents the ID of a user, and `tweepcred` represents their Tweepcred score. This case class is used to store Tweepcred scores for users in the Interaction Graph.

Overall, these case classes provide a standardized way to store and retrieve data in the Interaction Graph. For example, to store a new `InteractionGraphRawInput` object, one could simply create a new instance of the case class and add it to a data store. Similarly, to retrieve a feature value for a given `FeatureKey`, one could use the `src`, `dest`, and `name` fields to look up the corresponding value in a data store. 

Example usage:

```scala
val rawInput = InteractionGraphRawInput(123, 456, FeatureName("example_feature"), 7, 3.14)
// store rawInput in a data store

val featureKey = FeatureKey(123, 456, FeatureName("example_feature"))
val featureValue = retrieveFeatureValue(featureKey) // retrieve feature value from a data store
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InteractionGraphRawInput` case class?
   - The `InteractionGraphRawInput` case class defines a common type for edge/vertex feature calculation, with fields for source ID, destination ID, feature name, age of the relationship, and value to be aggregated.
2. What is the significance of the `FeatureKey` case class?
   - The `FeatureKey` case class represents a unique key for a feature, with fields for source ID, destination ID, and feature name.
3. What is the purpose of the `Tweepcred` case class?
   - The `Tweepcred` case class represents a user's "tweepcred" score, with fields for user ID and tweepcred value (a short integer).
