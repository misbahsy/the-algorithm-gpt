The `ConversionUtil` object in the `com.twitter.interaction_graph.scio.common` package provides utility methods for converting data structures used in the Twitter Interaction Graph project. 

The `toRealGraphEdgeFeatureV1` method takes a `TimeSeriesStatistics` object and returns a `RealGraphEdgeFeatureV1` object. This method is used to convert time series statistics for a particular feature into a format that can be used in the Interaction Graph. 

The `hasNegativeFeatures` method checks if a `RealGraphEdgeFeatures` object has any negative interaction features, such as mutes, blocks, report as abuses, or report as spams. This method is used to filter out negative interactions that are not relevant to the UserSession thrift.

The `hasTimelinesRequiredFeatures` method checks if a `RealGraphEdgeFeatures` object has some of the key interaction features required for the Timeline project. This method is used to filter out interactions that are not relevant to the Timeline project.

The `toRealGraphEdgeFeatures` method takes a filter function and an `Edge` object and returns a `RealGraphEdgeFeatures` object if the filter function returns true. This method is used to convert an `Edge` object into a `RealGraphEdgeFeatures` object and filter out unwanted interactions early on during the conversion process.

Overall, the `ConversionUtil` object provides useful utility methods for converting and filtering data structures used in the Twitter Interaction Graph project. These methods can be used in various parts of the project to ensure that only relevant interactions are included in the final output. 

Example usage:

```
val tss = TimeSeriesStatistics(mean = 10.0, ewma = 8.0, m2ForVariance = 20.0, numDaysSinceLast = Some(5), numNonZeroDays = 3, numElapsedDays = 7)
val realGraphEdgeFeatureV1 = ConversionUtil.toRealGraphEdgeFeatureV1(tss)
val edge = Edge(destinationId = 123, weight = Some(0.5), features = Seq(EdgeFeature(name = FeatureName.NumRetweets, tss = tss)))
val realGraphEdgeFeatures = ConversionUtil.toRealGraphEdgeFeatures(ConversionUtil.hasTimelinesRequiredFeatures)(edge)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConversionUtil` object?
- The `ConversionUtil` object provides utility functions for converting data types related to the interaction graph of Twitter.

2. What is the purpose of the `toRealGraphEdgeFeatures` function?
- The `toRealGraphEdgeFeatures` function converts an `Edge` object into a `RealGraphEdgeFeatures` object and returns it if a given filter function is true. This allows for early filtering during the conversion process.

3. What are some examples of key interaction features checked for in the `hasTimelinesRequiredFeatures` function?
- Examples of key interaction features checked for in the `hasTimelinesRequiredFeatures` function include retweets, favorites, mentions, tweet clicks, link clicks, profile views, and follow/mutual follow features.
