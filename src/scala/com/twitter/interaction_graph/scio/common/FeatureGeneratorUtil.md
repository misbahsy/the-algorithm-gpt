The `FeatureGeneratorUtil` object in the `com.twitter.interaction_graph.scio.common` package provides utility functions for generating vertex and edge features from an input graph. The input graph is represented as a collection of `InteractionGraphRawInput` objects, each of which contains information about a directed edge in the graph, including the source and destination user IDs, the name of the feature being represented, the age of the feature (in days), and the value of the feature.

The `getVertexFeature` function takes an input collection of `InteractionGraphRawInput` objects and returns a collection of `Vertex` objects, where each `Vertex` object represents a user in the graph and contains a list of `VertexFeature` objects, each of which represents a feature associated with that user. The `VertexFeature` objects contain information about the feature name, whether the feature is incoming or outgoing, and a `TimeSeriesStatistics` object that summarizes the feature value over time. The `getVertexFeature` function calculates both incoming and outgoing feature values for each user, and aggregates these values across all edges in the graph.

The `getEdgeFeature` function takes an input collection of `InteractionGraphRawInput` objects and returns a collection of `Edge` objects, where each `Edge` object represents a directed edge in the graph and contains a list of `EdgeFeature` objects, each of which represents a feature associated with that edge. The `EdgeFeature` objects contain information about the feature name and a `TimeSeriesStatistics` object that summarizes the feature value over time. The `getEdgeFeature` function excludes non-directional features (e.g., features that are represented as vertex features) from the edge aggregates.

The `combineVertexFeatures` and `combineEdgeFeatures` functions take collections of `Vertex` and `Edge` objects, respectively, and combine features for the same user or edge into a single `Vertex` or `Edge` object. The `combineVertexFeaturesWithDecay` and `combineEdgeFeaturesWithDecay` functions perform a similar operation, but with a decay factor applied to older feature values to give more weight to more recent data.

The `removeStatusFeatures` function removes edge features that represent status information (e.g., flock, address book, or SMS data) from the output, as these features are refreshed on a daily basis. The `edgeWithFeatureOtherThanDwellTime` function checks whether an edge has any features other than dwell time features, which are used to represent the amount of time that users spend interacting with each other.

Overall, the `FeatureGeneratorUtil` object provides a set of utility functions for generating vertex and edge features from an input graph, which can be used as input to machine learning models or other data analysis tasks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FeatureGeneratorUtil` object?
- The `FeatureGeneratorUtil` object is used to generate vertex and edge features from an input graph represented as `InteractionGraphRawInput`.

2. What is the significance of the `DUMMY_USER_ID` constant?
- The `DUMMY_USER_ID` constant is used to represent non-existent users in the input graph. It is used to filter out non-directional features from the edge output.

3. What is the purpose of the `combineVertexFeaturesWithDecay` method?
- The `combineVertexFeaturesWithDecay` method is used to combine vertex features from two different collections (`history` and `daily`) with different weights (`historyWeight` and `dailyWeight`) based on their age. The resulting vertex features are combined using a `VertexFeatureCombiner` object and returned as an `SCollection` of `Vertex`.
