The `UserUtil` object contains utility methods for filtering and processing user data in the context of the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `getValidUsers` method takes an `SCollection` of `CombinedUser` objects and returns an `SCollection` of `Long` user IDs that pass certain validity checks. Specifically, the method filters out users with ID 0 and users with certain safety flags set to true (suspended, deactivated, restricted, nsfwUser, nsfwAdmin, erased). This method may be used to extract a list of valid user IDs for further processing in the project.

The `getValidFlatUsers` method is similar to `getValidUsers`, but takes an `SCollection` of `FlatUser` objects instead. This method filters out users with ID 0 and users with `validUser` set to false. This method may be used to extract a list of valid user IDs from a different type of user data.

The `getInvalidUsers` method takes an `SCollection` of `FlatUser` objects and returns an `SCollection` of `Long` user IDs that have `validUser` set to false. This method may be used to extract a list of invalid user IDs for further processing in the project.

The `filterUsersByIdMapping` method takes an `SCollection` of data objects, an `SCollection` of user IDs to be filtered out, and a function that maps each data object to a user ID. The method returns an `SCollection` of data objects that do not have a user ID in the `usersToBeFiltered` collection. This method may be used to filter out data objects associated with certain users.

The `filterUsersByMultipleIdMappings` method is similar to `filterUsersByIdMapping`, but takes a sequence of user ID mapping functions instead of a single function. The method applies each mapping function in sequence to filter out data objects associated with multiple sets of users. This method may be used to filter out data objects associated with multiple sets of users based on different criteria.

Overall, the `UserUtil` object provides a set of utility methods for filtering and processing user data in the context of The Algorithm from Twitter project. These methods may be used to extract lists of valid or invalid user IDs, filter out data objects associated with certain users, and perform other user-related operations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UserUtil` object?
- The `UserUtil` object contains utility functions for filtering and processing user data.

2. What is the significance of the `DUMMY_USER_ID` constant?
- The `DUMMY_USER_ID` constant is used as a placeholder for representing vertex features with no destination ID. It is only aggregated and saved in the vertex datasets but not the edge datasets.

3. What is the purpose of the `filterUsersByMultipleIdMappings` function?
- The `filterUsersByMultipleIdMappings` function filters an `SCollection` of data by multiple user ID mappings. It takes in an input `SCollection`, an `SCollection` of user IDs to be filtered, and a sequence of functions that map the input data to user IDs. It applies each mapping function to the input data and filters out any data whose user ID is in the `usersToBeFiltered` collection.
