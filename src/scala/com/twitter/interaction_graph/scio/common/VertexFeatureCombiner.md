The `VertexFeatureCombiner` class in this code is responsible for combining multiple Vertex objects, which contain information about a single vertex, into a single Vertex object. This is useful for aggregating user interaction data from Twitter over a period of time. The class provides methods for adding features to the combined Vertex object, with or without decay, and generating the final combined Vertex instance.

The `apply` method in the `VertexFeatureCombiner` object initializes a new instance of the class with a predefined feature map. This map contains various Twitter interaction features, such as retweets, favorites, mentions, and more, along with their corresponding combiner classes (`WeightedAdditiveVertexCombiner` or `ReplacementVertexCombiner`).

The `WeightedAdditiveVertexCombiner` class implements a simple additive combiner with time-weighted (exponential decay) values. It updates the time series statistics (TSS) of the features based on the provided decay factor and day. The `ReplacementVertexCombiner` class, on the other hand, always replaces the old value with the current one, ignoring time-decays.

Here's an example of how the `VertexFeatureCombiner` class can be used:

```scala
val userId: Long = 12345
val combiner = VertexFeatureCombiner(userId)

val vertex1: Vertex = // ... some Vertex object for day 1
val vertex2: Vertex = // ... some Vertex object for day 2

val combinedCombiner = combiner.addFeature(vertex1).addFeature(vertex2, alpha = 0.5, day = 1)
val combinedVertex = combinedCombiner.getCombinedVertex(totalDays = 2)
```

In this example, we first create a `VertexFeatureCombiner` instance for a specific user. Then, we add two Vertex objects (representing user interaction data for two different days) to the combiner. Finally, we generate the combined Vertex instance, which contains the aggregated interaction data for the user.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `VertexFeatureCombiner` class and how does it work with the `VFeatureCombiner` trait?
   **Answer**: The `VertexFeatureCombiner` class is used to combine multiple Vertex thrift objects containing information about a single vertex into a single Vertex protobuf object. It uses the `VFeatureCombiner` trait to define the combination logic for different types of features, such as weighted additive or replacement.

2. **Question**: How does the `WeightedAdditiveVertexCombiner` and `ReplacementVertexCombiner` classes differ in their implementation of the `VFeatureCombiner` trait?
   **Answer**: The `WeightedAdditiveVertexCombiner` class implements the `VFeatureCombiner` trait to perform a weighted addition of features, taking into account time decay. The `ReplacementVertexCombiner` class, on the other hand, always replaces the old value with the current value and ignores time decay.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `InteractionGraphUtils` class and how is it used in the `WeightedAdditiveVertexCombiner` and `ReplacementVertexCombiner` classes?
   **Answer**: The `InteractionGraphUtils` class is not shown in the provided code, but it seems to provide utility functions for updating and adding time series statistics. It is used in both `WeightedAdditiveVertexCombiner` and `ReplacementVertexCombiner` classes to update and add time series statistics for the features being combined.
