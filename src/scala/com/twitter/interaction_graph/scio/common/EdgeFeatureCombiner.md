The `EdgeFeatureCombiner` class in this code is designed to aggregate and combine features of edges in a directed interaction graph, such as Twitter's user interactions. The edges represent interactions between users, and the features are various types of interactions, such as retweets, favorites, mentions, and more. The class can handle two modes of aggregation: additive (for same-day interactions) and time-decayed (for combining multiple days).

The `EdgeFeatureCombiner` class takes an `Edge` object and a `featureMap` as input. The `featureMap` is a mapping of `FeatureName` to `EFeatureCombiner` objects, which define the aggregation logic for each feature. The class provides methods to add features to the combiner, either without decay (for same-day interactions) or with decay (for multiple days). The decay is calculated using an alpha parameter and the number of days from the current day.

The `EFeatureCombiner` trait defines the interface for feature combiners, with methods to update, set, and get the final combined feature. Two implementations are provided: `WeightedAdditiveEdgeCombiner` and `BooleanOrEdgeCombiner`. The former is used for features that require a weighted sum, while the latter is used for features that require a boolean OR operation.

Here's an example of how the `EdgeFeatureCombiner` can be used:

```scala
val combiner = EdgeFeatureCombiner(srcId, destId)
val combinedEdge = combiner.addFeature(edge1).addFeature(edge2, alpha, day).getCombinedEdge(totalDays)
```

In this example, `combiner` is an instance of `EdgeFeatureCombiner` with a specified source and destination user ID. The `addFeature` method is called to add features from `edge1` and `edge2` to the combiner, with the latter using decay. Finally, the `getCombinedEdge` method is called to generate the final combined `Edge` object with the aggregated features.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `EdgeFeatureCombiner` class and how does it work with the different types of `EFeatureCombiner` implementations?
   **Answer:** The `EdgeFeatureCombiner` class is used to combine multiple input Edge thrift objects, which contain information about a single edge, into a single combined Edge protobuf object. It supports two modes of aggregation: one without decay (for the same day) and one with time-decayed values. It works with different `EFeatureCombiner` implementations to handle the actual combination logic for specific types of features, such as `WeightedAdditiveEdgeCombiner` for additive features and `BooleanOrEdgeCombiner` for boolean features.

2. **Question:** How does the `WeightedAdditiveEdgeCombiner` handle time decay when updating features?
   **Answer:** The `WeightedAdditiveEdgeCombiner` handles time decay by updating the `TimeSeriesStatistics` object associated with the feature. It uses the `alpha` parameter for the decay calculation and updates the `ewma` (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) value of the `TimeSeriesStatistics` object accordingly.

3. **Question:** How does the `BooleanOrEdgeCombiner` differ from the `WeightedAdditiveEdgeCombiner` in terms of feature combination logic?
   **Answer:** The `BooleanOrEdgeCombiner` differs from the `WeightedAdditiveEdgeCombiner` in that it ignores time decay and resets the value to 0 if the latest event being combined has a value of 0. It only considers whether the current value or the new feature value is greater than 0, and sets the new value to 1 if either of them is greater than 0, otherwise sets it to 0.
