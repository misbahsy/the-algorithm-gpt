The `DateUtil` object in the `com.twitter.interaction_graph.scio.common` package provides three methods for manipulating Joda-Time `Interval` objects. 

The `embiggen` method takes an `Interval` and a `Duration` and returns a new `Interval` with the start and end dates extended by the number of days specified in the `Duration`. For example, if `dateInterval` is an `Interval` representing the dates from January 1 to January 10, and `duration` is a `Duration` of 3 days, then `embiggen(dateInterval, duration)` will return a new `Interval` representing the dates from December 29 to January 13.

The `subtract` method takes an `Interval` and a `Duration` and returns a new `Interval` with the start and end dates moved back by the number of days specified in the `Duration`. For example, if `dateInterval` is an `Interval` representing the dates from January 1 to January 10, and `duration` is a `Duration` of 3 days, then `subtract(dateInterval, duration)` will return a new `Interval` representing the dates from December 28 to January 7.

The `prependDays` method takes an `Interval` and a `Duration` and returns a new `Interval` with the start date moved back by the number of days specified in the `Duration`. The end date remains the same. For example, if `dateInterval` is an `Interval` representing the dates from January 1 to January 10, and `duration` is a `Duration` of 3 days, then `prependDays(dateInterval, duration)` will return a new `Interval` representing the dates from December 29 to January 10.

These methods may be used in the larger project to manipulate date intervals for various purposes, such as filtering data or calculating time-based metrics. For example, the `embiggen` method could be used to expand a date range for a data query to include additional data points, while the `subtract` method could be used to calculate the duration of an event by subtracting the start and end dates. The `prependDays` method could be used to shift a date range back in time to align with a different time period, such as a fiscal year.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code provides utility functions related to date intervals and durations. It is likely used throughout the project to manipulate and calculate date ranges.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the `com.twitter.util.Duration` and `org.joda.time.Interval` classes, which are likely part of external libraries or dependencies.

3. Are there any potential issues with using this code, such as edge cases or performance concerns?
   - It's difficult to determine without more context, but one potential issue could be that the functions only work with `Interval` objects from the Joda Time library, which may not be compatible with other date/time libraries. Additionally, depending on the size of the date intervals and durations being used, there could be performance concerns with the repeated use of `minusDays` and `plusDays` methods.
