The code defines a Scala object called InteractionGraphUtils that contains two methods: updateTimeSeriesStatistics and addToTimeSeriesStatistics. These methods are used to update and add to a TimeSeriesStatistics object, which is defined in another package. 

The TimeSeriesStatistics object contains several fields, including mean, m2ForVariance, ewma, and numNonZeroDays. These fields are updated in the updateTimeSeriesStatistics method using the current value of the time series, the alpha value, and the previous values of the fields. The method calculates the updated mean, m2ForVariance, and ewma using the current value and the previous values of the fields. The numNonZeroDays field is incremented by 1. The updated values are then used to create a new TimeSeriesStatistics object, which is returned.

The addToTimeSeriesStatistics method is simpler and only adds the current value to the mean and ewma fields of the TimeSeriesStatistics object. 

These methods are likely used in the larger project to analyze time series data, such as user interactions on Twitter. The TimeSeriesStatistics object may be used to store statistics about user interactions over time, such as the mean number of interactions per day, the variance of the number of interactions, and the exponentially weighted moving average of the number of interactions. The updateTimeSeriesStatistics method may be used to update these statistics as new data becomes available, while the addToTimeSeriesStatistics method may be used to add new data to the existing statistics. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.interaction_graph.scio.common.InteractionGraphUtils
import com.twitter.interaction_graph.thriftscala.TimeSeriesStatistics

val stats = TimeSeriesStatistics(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0)
val newValue = 10.0
val alpha = 0.5

val updatedStats = InteractionGraphUtils.updateTimeSeriesStatistics(stats, newValue, alpha)
println(updatedStats.mean) // prints updated mean value
println(updatedStats.ewma) // prints updated ewma value

val addedStats = InteractionGraphUtils.addToTimeSeriesStatistics(stats, newValue)
println(addedStats.mean) // prints updated mean value with new value added
println(addedStats.ewma) // prints updated ewma value with new value added
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InteractionGraphUtils` object?
- The `InteractionGraphUtils` object provides utility functions for updating and adding to time series statistics.

2. What do the constants `MIN_FEATURE_VALUE`, `MAX_DAYS_RETENTION`, and `MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY` represent?
- `MIN_FEATURE_VALUE` represents the minimum value for a feature. `MAX_DAYS_RETENTION` represents the maximum number of days to retain data. `MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY` represents the number of milliseconds in a day.

3. What is the difference between the `updateTimeSeriesStatistics` and `addToTimeSeriesStatistics` functions?
- `updateTimeSeriesStatistics` updates the mean, variance, and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of a time series with a new value and returns the updated statistics. `addToTimeSeriesStatistics` adds a new value to the mean and EWMA of a time series and returns the updated statistics.
