The `InteractionGraphScoreExportJob` object is a Scala class that exports scores from a BigQuery table to two different datasets. The purpose of this code is to read data from a BigQuery table, process it, and write the results to two different datasets. The code is designed to be run as a ScioBeamJob, which is a job that runs on the Google Cloud Dataflow service.

The `InteractionGraphScoreExportJob` object contains two methods: `runPipeline` and `configurePipeline`. The `runPipeline` method is responsible for checking if the data for the specified date is present in the BigQuery table. If the data is not present, it throws a `DataNotFoundException`. If the data is present, it calls the `sc.run()` method to run the pipeline. The `configurePipeline` method is responsible for configuring the pipeline. It reads data from the BigQuery table, processes it, and writes the results to two different datasets.

The `InteractionGraphScoreExportJob` object contains two functions: `parseDateRow` and `parseRow`. The `parseDateRow` function is used to parse the latest date from the BigQuery table. The `parseRow` function is used to parse each row from the BigQuery table. Both functions are implemented as `SerializableFunction` objects.

The `InteractionGraphScoreExportJob` object reads data from a BigQuery table using the `BigQueryIO.read` method. It then processes the data using the `collect`, `groupByKey`, and `map` methods. Finally, it writes the results to two different datasets using the `saveAsCustomOutput` method.

Here is an example of how to use the `InteractionGraphScoreExportJob` object:

```
val sc = ScioContext()
val opts = InteractionGraphScoreExportOption(...)
InteractionGraphScoreExportJob.runPipeline(sc, opts)
```

In this example, `ScioContext` is used to create a new Scio context, and `InteractionGraphScoreExportOption` is used to create a new options object. The `runPipeline` method is then called to run the pipeline.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for exporting scores from a BigQuery table and writing them to two different datasets.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Cloud BigQuery, Spotify Scio, Twitter DAL, and Apache Beam.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The expected input is a BigQuery table with specific fields and a date restriction. The expected output is two datasets containing scored edges sorted by score.
