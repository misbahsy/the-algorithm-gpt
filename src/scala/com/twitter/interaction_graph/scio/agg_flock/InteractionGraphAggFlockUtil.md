The `InteractionGraphAggFlockUtil` object contains two methods that are used to extract features from FlockDB edges and convert them into Interaction Graph inputs. The first method, `getFlockFeatures`, takes in an `SCollection` of `FlockEdge` objects, a `FeatureName` object, and an `Interval` object representing a date range. It then maps over the edges and converts them into `InteractionGraphRawInput` objects. The `InteractionGraphRawInput` object contains information about the source and destination IDs, the feature name, the age of the edge, and a weight of 1.0. The age of the edge is calculated by taking the difference between the start and end dates of the date range and adding 1 to it. This method is used to extract features from FlockDB edges and convert them into Interaction Graph inputs that can be used for further analysis.

The second method, `getMutualFollowFeature`, takes in an `SCollection` of `InteractionGraphRawInput` objects that were generated by the `getFlockFeatures` method. It then maps over the inputs and converts them into tuples of `(Tuple2(Long, Long), Tuple2(Set[Boolean], Min))`. The first element of the tuple is a pair of source and destination IDs, and the second element is a pair of a set of booleans and a `Min` object. The boolean set contains either `true` or `false` depending on whether the source follows the destination or is followed by the destination. The `Min` object contains the minimum age of the edge between the source and destination. The tuples are then summed by key, and the resulting tuples are filtered to only include pairs where the boolean set contains both `true` and `false`. For each of these pairs, two `InteractionGraphRawInput` objects are generated with the same age and weight of 1.0, but with the source and destination IDs swapped. These objects represent the mutual follow relationship between the source and destination IDs. This method is used to extract the mutual follow feature from the FlockDB edges and convert them into Interaction Graph inputs.

Overall, these methods are used to extract features from FlockDB edges and convert them into Interaction Graph inputs that can be used for further analysis. The `getFlockFeatures` method is used to extract features such as the age of the edge, while the `getMutualFollowFeature` method is used to extract the mutual follow feature. These features can then be used to analyze the interaction graph and gain insights into the relationships between users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Scala object that contains two functions for generating interaction graph features from FlockDB edges.

2. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries, including com.spotify.scio, com.twitter.algebird, com.twitter.flockdb, and org.joda.time.

3. What is the input and output of the `getMutualFollowFeature` function?
- The input of the `getMutualFollowFeature` function is an SCollection of InteractionGraphRawInput objects representing FlockDB edges. The output is also an SCollection of InteractionGraphRawInput objects, but with the FeatureName.NumMutualFollows feature added based on the input edges.
