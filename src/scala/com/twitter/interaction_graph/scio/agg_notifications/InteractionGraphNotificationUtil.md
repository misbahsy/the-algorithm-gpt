The `InteractionGraphNotificationUtil` object contains utility methods for extracting information from log events related to push notifications and ntab clicks in the Twitter app. The purpose of this code is to extract tweet IDs and user IDs from log events and count the number of push opens and ntab clicks for each tweet. This information can be used to generate features for the interaction graph, which is a graph-based model of user interactions with tweets.

The `extractTweetIdFromUrl` method takes a URL string and uses regular expressions to extract the tweet ID from the URL. If the URL matches either the `STATUS_ID_REGEX` or `TWEET_ID_REGEX`, the method increments a counter and returns the tweet ID as an `Option[Long]`. This method is used by other methods in the object to extract tweet IDs from log events.

The `getPushNtabEvents` method takes a `LogEvent` object and returns a sequence of tuples containing tweet IDs, user IDs, and feature names. The method first checks if the log event corresponds to a push open or ntab click event. If it is a push open event, the method extracts the tweet ID from the event details using the `extractTweetIdFromUrl` method and returns a tuple with the tweet ID and the `NumPushOpens` feature name. If it is an ntab click event, the method extracts the tweet IDs from the event details and returns a sequence of tuples with the tweet IDs and the `NumNtabClicks` feature name. This method is used to generate features for push opens and ntab clicks in the interaction graph.

The `getNtabEvents` method is similar to `getPushNtabEvents`, but it only returns ntab click events. This method is used to generate features for ntab clicks in the interaction graph.

The `getPushOpenEvents` method is similar to `getPushNtabEvents`, but it only returns push open events and uses the impression ID instead of the tweet ID as the key. This method is used to generate features for push opens in the interaction graph.

Overall, this code provides utility methods for extracting information from log events related to push notifications and ntab clicks in the Twitter app. This information can be used to generate features for the interaction graph, which is a graph-based model of user interactions with tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an object called `InteractionGraphNotificationUtil` that contains methods for extracting tweet IDs and events from log data.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports classes from the `com.spotify.scio` and `com.twitter.clientapp.thriftscala` packages.

3. What metrics are being tracked in this code?
- This code uses the `ScioMetrics` object to track counters for regex matching and different types of events, such as push opens and ntab clicks.
