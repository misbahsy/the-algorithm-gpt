The code provided contains three Scala objects: `ScheduledTimelinesDataExtractionBatch`, `AdhocTimelinesDataExtraction`, and `TimelinesEngagementDataExtractor`. 

`ScheduledTimelinesDataExtractionBatch` is a scheduled job that extracts data from two sources of tweet engagement data from Home Timeline's data: Recap tweets and RecTweets. Recap tweets are tweets and retweets from a user's follow graph, while RecTweets are out-of-network tweets not from a user's follow graph. The extracted data is written to a DAL snapshot execution. 

`AdhocTimelinesDataExtraction` is an ad-hoc version of the job to process a subset of the Timeline data. It is used to catch up with data on a particular day or to generate human-readable data for debugging. It reads the same two sources of tweet engagement data as `ScheduledTimelinesDataExtractionBatch` and writes the extracted data in either plain text in TSV format or compact thrift LZO format. 

`TimelinesEngagementDataExtractor` is a base class that provides functions to parse tweet engagement data from Home Timeline's data. It contains two functions: `readTimelinesRecapTweets` and `readTimelinesRecTweets`. `readTimelinesRecapTweets` returns Recap tweets, while `readTimelinesRecTweets` returns RecTweets. Both functions filter the data based on date range, sample rate, and other criteria, and then extract relevant features from the data. 

Overall, these objects are used to extract tweet engagement data from Home Timeline's data, which can be used for various purposes such as evaluating tweet performance and predicting user behavior. The extracted data can be written to a DAL snapshot execution or in plain text or compact thrift LZO format for human readability or further processing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScheduledTimelinesDataExtractionBatch` object?
- The `ScheduledTimelinesDataExtractionBatch` object is a scheduled job that parses Timelines data for impressed and engaged tweets and writes the output to a DAL snapshot.

2. What is the purpose of the `AdhocTimelinesDataExtraction` object?
- The `AdhocTimelinesDataExtraction` object is an ad-hoc job that processes a subset of the Timeline data, either to catch up with data on a particular day or to generate human-readable data for debugging.

3. What is the purpose of the `TimelinesEngagementDataExtractor` object?
- The `TimelinesEngagementDataExtractor` object provides functions to parse tweet engagement data from Home Timeline's data, specifically for Recap tweets and RecTweets.
