This code is part of a project that evaluates the performance of a recommendation algorithm for Twitter. The main purpose of this code is to provide various evaluation metrics for the algorithm, such as engagement rates, user engagement counts, and label correlations. These metrics help assess the quality of the recommended tweets and compare them with the actual tweets that users engaged with.

The code defines several case classes to store different types of statistics and engagement data. For example, `UserEngagerCounts` stores the number of distinct users who engaged with tweets, while `TweetStats` stores information about the number of tweets, authors, and average scores. The `LabeledTweet` case class is used to store both the reference label engagements and the recommendation algorithm's scores, which is helpful for evaluating joint data.

The `EvaluationMetricHelper` object provides various helper functions to calculate these metrics. For instance, `getUniqueCount` calculates the number of unique elements in a pipe, while `countUniqueEngagedUsersBy` counts the number of unique users who engaged with tweets based on a given condition. The `getEngagementRate` function calculates the engagement rates for likes, retweets, and clicks.

The code also provides functions to calculate evaluation results for candidate tweets and reference tweets. For example, `getEvaluationResultsForCandidates` calculates the metrics for a pipe of `CandidateTweets`, while `getEvaluationResultsForLabeledTweets` calculates the metrics for a pipe of `LabeledTweet`. These functions are used in the `runAllEvaluations` function, which calculates the evaluation metrics for reference tweets, candidate tweets, and their intersection.

Overall, this code is essential for evaluating the performance of the recommendation algorithm and understanding how well it is performing in recommending tweets to users.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `EvaluationMetricHelper` object and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `EvaluationMetricHelper` object is a helper class for evaluating a given candidate tweet set against a reference tweet set. It provides aggregation evaluation metrics such as sum of engagements, rate of engagements, etc. Its methods are used to calculate various statistics and metrics related to tweet engagements, user counts, and correlations.

2. **Question**: How does the `outerJoinReferenceAndCandidate` method work, and what is its output?
   **Answer**: The `outerJoinReferenceAndCandidate` method performs an outer join between the reference tweets and candidate tweets, keyed by (targetUserId, tweetId). It assumes the uniqueness of keys, i.e., (targetId, tweetId). The output is a `CoGrouped` object containing tuples with (targetUserId, tweetId) as keys and (Option[ReferenceTweet], Option[CandidateTweet]) as values.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `runAllEvaluations` method, and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `runAllEvaluations` method is used to calculate and print various evaluation metrics for reference tweets, candidate tweets, and their intersections. It takes `TypedPipe` objects of `ReferenceTweets` and `CandidateTweets` as input. The method returns an `Execution[String]` object containing the formatted results of the evaluation metrics.
