The code provided is a part of the Twitter Algorithm project and contains helper functions and a trait for evaluating the quality of a set of candidate tweets. The trait `CandidateEvaluationBase` provides a basic flow for evaluating the quality of a set of candidate tweets by comparing its engagement rates against a set of reference tweets. The job goes through the following steps:

1. Generate a group of target users on which we measure tweet engagements.
2. Collect tweets impressed by these users and their engagements on tweets from a labeled tweet source (ex. Home Timeline engagement data), and form a reference set.
3. For each candidate tweet, collect the engagement rates from the reference set.
4. Run evaluation calculations (ex. percentage of intersection, engagement rate, etc).

The trait `UserStateBasedEvaluationExecutionBase` is a variation of the evaluation base where target users are sampled by user states. For each user state of interest (e.x. HEAVY_TWEETER), a separate evaluation call is run, and the evaluation results are output per user state. This is helpful when we want to horizontally compare how users in different user states respond to the candidate tweets.

The object `UserStateUserSampler` contains helper functions to provide user samples by sampling across user states. The function `getSampleUsersByUserState` takes a `userStateSource`, `validStates`, and `samplePercentage` as input and returns a `TypedPipe[(UserState, Long)]`. The function `parseUserStates` takes a list of string corresponding to user states and converts them to the `UserState` type. If the input is empty, it defaults to return all available user states.

The code uses the Scalding library for distributed data processing. It imports various classes from the library, such as `TypedPipe`, `TypedText`, `DAL`, and `TwitterExecutionApp`. The code also imports classes from the `thriftscala` package and the `CondensedUserStateScalaDataset` class from the `core_workflows.user_model` package.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for evaluating the quality of candidate tweets by comparing their engagement rates against a set of reference tweets. The variation of the evaluation base where target users are sampled by user states allows for horizontal comparison of user responses to candidate tweets. The helper functions in `UserStateUserSampler` provide user samples by sampling across user states.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UserStateUserSampler` object?
- The `UserStateUserSampler` object provides helper functions to sample user states and get sample users by user state.

2. What is the purpose of the `UserStateBasedEvaluationExecutionBase` trait?
- The `UserStateBasedEvaluationExecutionBase` trait is a variation of the evaluation base where target users are sampled by user states. It runs a separate evaluation call for each user state of interest and outputs the evaluation results per user state.

3. What is the purpose of the `CandidateEvaluationBase` trait?
- The `CandidateEvaluationBase` trait provides a basic flow for evaluating the quality of a set of candidate tweets by comparing its engagement rates against a set of reference tweets. It includes functions to get sampled reference tweets and candidate tweets, and an evaluation function that should be overridden by implementing sub classes to suit individual objectives.
