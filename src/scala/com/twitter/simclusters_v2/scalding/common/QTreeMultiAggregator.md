The QTreeMultiAggregator class is designed to provide multiple percentiles from the same QTree. The class is a part of the Scalding library, which is used for building data processing applications on Hadoop. The QTreeMultiAggregator class is an implementation of the Aggregator trait, which is used to aggregate data in Scalding. 

The class takes a sequence of percentiles and a Numeric type as input parameters. The percentiles must be between 0 and 1. The class extends the QTreeAggregatorLike trait, which provides the implementation of the QTree data structure. The QTree is a binary tree that is used to store data in a sorted manner. It is used to efficiently calculate percentiles of a dataset. 

The QTreeMultiAggregator class overrides the percentile and k methods of the Aggregator trait. The percentile method is not used in this class, but it is needed for the base class. The k method returns the default value of the QTreeAggregator.DefaultK constant. 

The class has a private method called getPercentile, which takes a QTree and a percentile value as input parameters. The method calculates the lower and upper bounds of the percentile using the quantileBounds method of the QTree class. It then returns the average of the lower and upper bounds. 

The present method of the class takes a QTree as input parameter and returns a Map of percentiles and their corresponding values. The method uses the getPercentile method to calculate the percentile values for each percentile in the input sequence. The method returns a Map with the percentile values as the values and the percentile values as the keys. 

Overall, the QTreeMultiAggregator class is a useful implementation of the Aggregator trait that provides multiple percentiles from the same QTree. It can be used in data processing applications to efficiently calculate percentiles of a dataset. 

Example usage:

```
val data = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
val qt = QTreeAggregator.fromIterable(data)
val aggregator = QTreeMultiAggregator(Seq(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
val result = aggregator.present(qt)
println(result) // Map(0.25 -> 3.0, 0.5 -> 5.0, 0.75 -> 7.0)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called QTreeMultiAggregator that allows for multiple percentiles to be obtained from a single QTree, which is more efficient than having one QTree per percentile.

2. What is the input and output of the QTreeMultiAggregator class?
- The input is a sequence of values of type T, and the output is a map of percentile values as strings to their corresponding values as doubles.

3. What is the significance of the `num` parameter and the `percentile` and `k` methods?
- The `num` parameter is an implicit parameter of type Numeric[T] that allows for arithmetic operations to be performed on values of type T. The `percentile` method is overridden to return a default value of 0.0, and the `k` method is overridden to return a default value from the QTreeAggregator.DefaultK constant.
