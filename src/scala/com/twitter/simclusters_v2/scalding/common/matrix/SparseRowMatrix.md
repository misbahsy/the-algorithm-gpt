The `SparseRowMatrix` class represents a row-indexed matrix, backed by a `TypedPipe[(R, Map[C, V])]`. For each row of the `TypedPipe`, it saves the rowId and a map consisting of colIds and their values. This class is optimized for cases where the max number of non-zero values per row is small (e.g., <100K) and the matrix is skinny (i.e., the number of unique colIds is small).

The class provides various methods for matrix operations, such as getting a specific element, row, or column, filtering rows or columns, applying a function to each element, and calculating row and column L2 norms. Additionally, it offers methods for row and column normalization, taking top K elements per row or column, and forcing the matrix to disk.

The `SparseRowMatrix` class also supports matrix multiplication with other matrices, such as multiplying with a `SkinnySparseRowMatrix` or a `DenseRowMatrix`. For example, the `transposeAndMultiplySkinnySparseRowMatrix` method transposes the current matrix and multiplies it with another skinny `SparseRowMatrix`, which is useful for computing the column-wise covariance matrix.

The class provides conversion methods to other matrix representations, such as `toSparseMatrix`, `toTypedPipe`, and `toDenseRowMatrix`. These methods allow for easy conversion between different matrix formats, depending on the requirements of the specific operation or algorithm being used.

Example usage:

```scala
val sparseRowMatrix = SparseRowMatrix(pipe, isSkinnyMatrix = true)
val rowL2Norms = sparseRowMatrix.rowL2Norms
val normalizedMatrix = sparseRowMatrix.rowL2Normalize
val topKElementsPerRow = sparseRowMatrix.sortWithTakePerRow(k = 5)(ordering)
val denseRowMatrix = sparseRowMatrix.toDenseRowMatrix(numCols, colToIndexFunction)
```

Overall, the `SparseRowMatrix` class provides an efficient and flexible representation of sparse row-indexed matrices, with various methods for matrix operations and conversions, making it a valuable component in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `isSkinnyMatrix` parameter in the `SparseRowMatrix` class?
   **Answer**: The `isSkinnyMatrix` parameter is used to indicate if the matrix is skinny (i.e., the number of unique column IDs is small). This information is used to optimize certain operations, such as column-wise normalization and matrix multiplication, for skinny matrices.

2. **Question**: How does the `transposeAndMultiplySkinnySparseRowMatrix` method work, and what are its limitations?
   **Answer**: The `transposeAndMultiplySkinnySparseRowMatrix` method transposes the current matrix and multiplies it with another skinny `SparseRowMatrix`. It is optimized to avoid unnecessary flattening and grouping operations. However, it requires the input matrix to be a skinny `SparseRowMatrix`, otherwise, it may cause out-of-memory issues.

3. **Question**: How does the `toDenseRowMatrix` method work, and what are its requirements?
   **Answer**: The `toDenseRowMatrix` method converts the current `SparseRowMatrix` to a `DenseRowMatrix`. It requires the number of columns in the dense matrix (`numCols`) and a function (`colToIndexFunction`) to convert column IDs to column indices in the dense matrix. The method creates an array for each row and populates it with the non-zero values from the sparse matrix, using the provided function to determine the correct index for each value.
