The `DenseRowMatrix` class represents a row-indexed dense matrix, backed by a `TypedPipe[(R, Array[Double])]`. Each row of the `TypedPipe` contains an array of values. This class should only be used when the number of columns is small (less than 100K). 

The class has several methods for converting the matrix to different formats. The `toSparseMatrix` method converts the matrix to a `SparseMatrix` format, while the `toSparseRowMatrix` method converts it to a `SparseRowMatrix` format. The `toTypedPipe` method simply returns the underlying `TypedPipe`. 

The `filterRows` method allows the user to filter the matrix based on a subset of rows. It takes a `TypedPipe` of rows as input and returns a new `DenseRowMatrix` with only the specified rows. 

The `rowL2Norms` method calculates the L2 norm for each row of the matrix. It returns a `TypedPipe` of `(R, Double)` pairs, where `R` is the row type and `Double` is the L2 norm. This method does not trigger a shuffle. 

The `rowL2Normalize` method normalizes the matrix to ensure that each row has unit norm. It returns a new `DenseRowMatrix` with the normalized values. 

Overall, this class provides a way to represent and manipulate dense matrices in a distributed environment using Scalding and Algebird libraries. It can be used in larger projects that require matrix operations, such as machine learning algorithms or graph processing. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.scalding._

// create a TypedPipe of (Int, Array[Double]) pairs
val data: TypedPipe[(Int, Array[Double])] = ...

// create a DenseRowMatrix from the TypedPipe
val matrix = DenseRowMatrix(data)

// filter the matrix based on a subset of rows
val filteredMatrix = matrix.filterRows(TypedPipe.from(Seq(1, 3, 5)))

// calculate the L2 norm for each row
val rowNorms = matrix.rowL2Norms

// normalize the matrix
val normalizedMatrix = matrix.rowL2Normalize
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used?
- This class represents a row-indexed dense matrix and is backed by a TypedPipe. It is used to store arrays of values for each row. It should only be used when the number of columns is small.
 
2. What is the difference between a SparseMatrix and a SparseRowMatrix?
- A SparseMatrix is a matrix where most of the elements are zero, while a SparseRowMatrix is a matrix where most of the elements in each row are zero. The toSparseMatrix method converts the DenseRowMatrix to a SparseMatrix, while the toSparseRowMatrix method converts it to a SparseRowMatrix.

3. What does the rowL2Normalize method do?
- The rowL2Normalize method normalizes the matrix to ensure that each row has a unit norm. It does this by dividing each value in a row by the L2 norm of that row.
