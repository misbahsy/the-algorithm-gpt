The `SparseMatrix` class represents a sparse matrix backed by a `TypedPipe[(R, C, V)]`, where `R` is the row type, `C` is the column type, and `V` is the value type. The matrix assumes that there is no more than one value per (row, col) and all input values are non-zero. The class provides various operations on the matrix, such as normalization, multiplication, transposition, and filtering.

For example, to create a sparse matrix `a` and normalize its rows, you can use the following code:

```scala
val a = SparseMatrix(TypedPipe.from(Seq((1,1,1.0), (2,2,2.0), (3,3,3.0))))
val b = a.rowL2Normalize // get a new matrix that has unit-norm each row.
```

The class also provides methods to multiply the matrix with other matrices, such as `multiplySparseMatrix`, `multiplySkinnySparseRowMatrix`, and `multiplyDenseRowMatrix`. These methods return a new matrix that is the result of the multiplication.

Additionally, the `SparseMatrix` class provides methods to filter the matrix based on certain conditions, such as `filterRowsByMinSum` and `filterRowsByMaxSum`. These methods return a new matrix that meets the specified conditions.

The `SparseMatrix` class can be used in the larger project to perform various matrix operations, such as finding similarities between users or items, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SparseMatrix` case class and how does it work with the TypedPipe?

   **Answer**: The `SparseMatrix` case class represents a sparse matrix backed by a TypedPipe[(R, C, V)]. It provides various operations on the matrix, such as row and column normalization, matrix multiplication, transposition, and filtering. The TypedPipe is used as the underlying data structure to store the matrix elements and their indices.

2. **Question**: How does the `multiplySparseMatrix` function work, and what are its requirements?

   **Answer**: The `multiplySparseMatrix` function multiplies the current matrix with another SparseMatrix. The only requirement is that the column type of the current matrix should be the same as the row type of the other matrix. It uses a sketch join to perform the multiplication efficiently and returns a new SparseMatrix as the result.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `filterRowsByMinSum` and `filterRowsByMaxSum` functions, and how do they work?

   **Answer**: The `filterRowsByMinSum` function removes entries whose sum over rows does not meet the minimum sum (minSum), while the `filterRowsByMaxSum` function removes entries whose sum over rows exceeds the maximum sum (maxSum). Both functions work by applying the `filterIter` function on the rowAsKeys group, which filters the rows based on the given threshold and condition (min or max).
