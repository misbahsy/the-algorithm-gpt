The `Util` object in the `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.scalding.common` package provides a set of utility functions for working with Scalding, a Scala library for building data processing pipelines. 

The `Util` object contains the following functions:

- `getCustomCounters`: This function takes an `Execution` object and returns a map of custom counters. It filters the counters to only include those with a group name of "Scalding Custom".
- `getCustomCountersString`: This function takes an `Execution` object and returns a string representation of the custom counters. It uses the `getCustomCounters` function to get the counters and formats them as a string.
- `printCounters`: This function takes an `Execution` object and prints the custom counters to the console. It uses the `getCustomCountersString` function to get the counters and prints the resulting string.
- `printSummaryOfNumericColumn`: This function takes a `TypedPipe` of numeric values and prints some basic statistics about the column. It uses the Algebird library to compute the statistics, including the size, max, min, sum, average, standard deviation, skewness, and percentiles of the column.
- `printSummaryOfCategoricalColumn`: This function takes a `TypedPipe` of categorical values and prints some basic statistics about the column. It uses the Algebird library to compute the statistics, including the size, number of unique values, and heavy hitters (i.e., the most common values).
- `reservoirSamplerMonoidForPairs`: This function returns a `PriorityQueueMonoid` that can be used to sample pairs of values. It takes a sample size and an ordering for the keys.
- `reservoirSamplerMonoid`: This function returns a `PriorityQueueMonoid` that can be used to sample values. It takes a sample size, a function to convert the values to a comparable type, and an ordering for the comparable type.
- `hashToLong`: This function takes two `Long` values and returns a hash code as a `Long`.
- `computeCorrelation`: This function takes an iterator of pairs of `Double` values and computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two columns.
- `cosineSimilarity`: This function takes an iterator of pairs of `Double` values and computes the cosine similarity between the two columns.
- `distributionFromArray`: This function takes an array of `Double` values and computes basic statistics about the distribution, including the average, standard deviation, and percentiles.
- `CumulativeStat`: This class represents a cumulative frequency distribution. It takes a key and a sequence of bucket thresholds and provides a method to increment the count for each bucket based on a given value.
- `sendEmail`: This function takes a string of text, a subject, and an email address and sends an email with the text as the body and the subject to the specified address. It uses the `mail` command-line utility to send the email.

Overall, the `Util` object provides a set of useful functions for working with data processing pipelines in Scalding. These functions can be used to compute statistics, sample data, and send notifications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Util` object?
- The `Util` object contains various utility functions for working with Scalding and Algebird libraries, such as printing custom counters, computing summary statistics for numeric and categorical columns, and sending emails.

2. What is the purpose of the `printSummaryOfNumericColumn` function?
- The `printSummaryOfNumericColumn` function takes a `TypedPipe` of numeric values and computes summary statistics such as size, max, min, sum, and percentiles. It returns an `Execution` that outputs a JSON-formatted string summarizing the statistics.

3. What is the purpose of the `sendEmail` function?
- The `sendEmail` function takes a string `text`, a string `subject`, and a string `toAddress`, and sends an email with the given text and subject to the given address using the `mail` command. It returns the output of the `mail` command as a string.
