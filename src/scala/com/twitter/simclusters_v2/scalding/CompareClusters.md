The `CompareClusters` object contains methods for comparing two sets of cluster assignments and generating statistics on the changes in cluster assignments. The `compareClusterAssignments` method takes two sets of known-for data and generates statistics on the changes in cluster assignments. The method uses the `outerJoin` method to join the two sets of data and then maps over the resulting tuples to calculate the statistics. The statistics include the number of users who had no assignment to some cluster, the number of users who had some assignment but no cluster, the number of users who had no assignment and no cluster, the number of users who remained in the same cluster, and the number of users who moved to a different cluster. The method returns a string representation of the statistics.

The `compare` method takes two sets of cluster assignments and compares them in terms of cosine similarity of corresponding clusters. The method excludes clusters that are too small. The method uses the `outerJoin` method to join the two sets of data and then maps over the resulting tuples to calculate the cosine similarity of the corresponding clusters. The method returns a `TypedPipe` of tuples containing the cluster ID and the cosine similarity.

The `summarize` method takes a `TypedPipe` of tuples containing the cluster ID and the cosine similarity and summarizes the cosine similarity distribution using the `Util.distributionFromArray` method. The method returns an `Execution` of an optional `Distribution`.

The `CompareClustersAdhoc` object is a Scalding job that reads two sets of known-for data, compares them using the `compare` method, and writes the results to a TSV file. The job takes two arguments: the paths to the two sets of known-for data and the path to the output directory. The job uses the `KnownForSources` object to read the known-for data and the `TypedTsv` class to write the results to a TSV file.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompareClusters` object?
- The `CompareClusters` object contains methods for comparing cluster assignments and calculating cosine similarity between clusters.

2. What is the significance of the `minSizeOfBiggerCluster` parameter in the `compare` method?
- The `minSizeOfBiggerCluster` parameter is used to exclude clusters that are too small from the comparison. Clusters with fewer members than this parameter will not be compared.

3. What is the purpose of the `CompareClustersAdhoc` object?
- The `CompareClustersAdhoc` object is a Scalding job that reads in two sets of cluster assignments and compares them using the `CompareClusters` methods. The results are written to an output file.
