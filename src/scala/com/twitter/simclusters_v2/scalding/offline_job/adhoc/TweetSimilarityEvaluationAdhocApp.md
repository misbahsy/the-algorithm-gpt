This code consists of two main components: `TweetSimilarityEvaluationSamplingAdhocApp` and `TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp`. Both components are part of a larger project that aims to evaluate the performance of an approximate nearest neighbor search method for finding similar tweets based on their embeddings.

`TweetSimilarityEvaluationSamplingAdhocApp` is responsible for sampling tweets for evaluation. It buckets tweets based on the logarithm of the number of favorites plus one and randomly selects 1000 tweets from each bucket for evaluation. The output is a list of sampled tweets with their bucket and bucket size information.

`TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp` evaluates the performance of the approximate nearest neighbor search method by comparing it with a brute force method. It first computes the ground truth set G of similar tweets for each sampled tweet using the brute force method, considering only tweets with cosine similarity score greater than 0.8 and taking up to the top 100 neighbors. Then, it computes the prediction set P of similar tweets for each sampled tweet using the approximate nearest neighbor search method. The precision and recall are calculated as follows:

- Precision = |P ∩ G| / |P|
- Recall = |P ∩ G| / |G|

The evaluation results are outputted along with some sample results for manual inspection.

To use these components, the user needs to run the `TweetSimilarityEvaluationSamplingAdhocApp` first to generate the sampled tweets, and then run the `TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp` to evaluate the performance of the approximate nearest neighbor search method.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetSimilarityEvaluationSamplingAdhocApp` object and how does it work?
   
   **Answer**: The `TweetSimilarityEvaluationSamplingAdhocApp` object is a job to sample some tweets for evaluation. It buckets tweets by the log(# of fav + 1) and randomly picks 1000 tweets for each bucket for evaluation. The job reads timeline favorite data, filters tweets with more than 10 favorites, and writes the output to a specified path.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp` object and how does it work?

   **Answer**: The `TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp` object is a job for evaluating the performance of an approximate nearest neighbor search method with a brute force method. It computes the nearest neighbors for the sampled tweets using the brute force method and the approximate nearest neighbor search, then evaluates the precision and recall. The output is written to a specified path.

3. **Question**: How are the precision and recall calculated in the `TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp` object?

   **Answer**: Precision and recall are calculated by comparing the ground-truth top similar tweets and the approximate top similar tweets for each sampled tweet. Precision is calculated as the size of the intersection between the ground-truth and predicted sets divided by the size of the predicted set. Recall is calculated as the size of the intersection between the ground-truth and predicted sets divided by the size of the ground-truth set.
