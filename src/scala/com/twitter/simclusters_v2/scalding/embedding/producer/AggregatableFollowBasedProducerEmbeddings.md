This code implements a new Producer SimClusters Embeddings for the Twitter project. The purpose of this code is to create embeddings that can be used to represent users and clusters in a graph. The embeddings are created using follow scores in the user-producer graph and user-simclusters graph. The differences with existing producer embeddings are that the embedding scores are not normalized, so that one can aggregate multiple producer embeddings by adding them. 

The code contains three objects: `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020ScheduledApp`, `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020AdhocApp`, and `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddingsBaseApp`. The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020ScheduledApp` object is used for production jobs, while the `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020AdhocApp` object is used for adhoc jobs. The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddingsBaseApp` object is a trait that provides common functionality for both the production and adhoc jobs.

The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020ScheduledApp` object writes the embeddings to HDFS in two formats: Scala and Thrift. The Scala format is written using the `DALWrite` library, while the Thrift format is written using the `FixedPathLzoScrooge` library. The embeddings are written to different paths depending on whether the job is running in adhoc or production mode. The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020ScheduledApp` object also specifies the model version, batch increment, and first time for the job.

The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020AdhocApp` object writes the embeddings to HDFS in TSV and Thrift formats. The TSV format is used for easier debugging of the adhoc job. The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020AdhocApp` object also specifies the model version and output paths for the job.

The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddingsBaseApp` trait provides common functionality for both the production and adhoc jobs. It specifies the scoring functions for user-to-producer and user-to-cluster relationships, as well as the embedding type.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Twitter project as it creates embeddings that can be used to represent users and clusters in a graph. The embeddings are created using follow scores in the user-producer graph and user-simclusters graph, and can be aggregated by adding them. The code provides functionality for both production and adhoc jobs, and writes the embeddings to HDFS in different formats depending on the job type.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code implements a new Producer SimClusters Embeddings that aggregates multiple producer embeddings by adding them, using follow scores in the user-producer graph and user-simclusters graph.
2. What is the difference between the `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020ScheduledApp` and `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020AdhocApp` objects?
- `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020ScheduledApp` is a scheduled production job that writes to both Scala and Thrift datasets, while `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddings2020AdhocApp` is an adhoc job that writes to a TSV file for easier debugging.
3. What is the purpose of the `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddingsBaseApp` trait and what does it contain?
- The `AggregatableFollowBasedProducerEmbeddingsBaseApp` trait contains methods and variables that are used by both the scheduled and adhoc apps, such as the scoring functions for user-to-producer and user-to-cluster, and the embedding type.
