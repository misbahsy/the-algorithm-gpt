The `SingleSideInteractionTransformation` object contains methods for building a SimCluster representation of interaction signals to model negative behavior like abuse and blocks. This is a "SingleSide" representation because only one side of the interaction graph is considered to build these features. The purpose of this job is to keep track of which SimClusters are most likely to get reported for abuse regardless of who reported it. Another job will be responsible for building the SimCluster to SimCluster interaction matrix as described in the documentation.

The `computeClusterFeatures` method computes a score for every SimCluster. The SimCluster score is a count of the number of interactions for each SimCluster. For a user that has many SimClusters, each of their interactions is distributed across all of these SimClusters. The method takes a sparse matrix of User-SimCluster scores and a graph of interactions as input and returns SingleSideClusterFeatures for each SimCluster that has a user with an interaction.

The `computeUserFeaturesFromClusters` method takes a sparse matrix of User-SimCluster scores and SimCluster features as input and returns SingleSideAbuseFeatures for each user with the SimClusters and scores for this. The method computes a representation of the user so that the new SimCluster scores are an estimate of the interactions for this user.

The `pairScores` method combines all the different SimClustersEmbedding for a user into one AdhocSingleSideClusterScores. The input is a map where the key is an identifier for the embedding type, and the typed pipe will have embeddings of only that type of embedding. The method returns a typed pipe with one AdhocSingleSideClusterScores per user.

The `clusterScoresFromGraphs` method takes a sparse matrix of User-SimCluster scores and a graph of interactions as input and returns SimClustersEmbedding for all users in the given SimCluster graphs. The method uses the `computeClusterFeatures` and `computeUserFeaturesFromClusters` methods to compute the SimCluster features and user features.

Overall, this code provides the logic for building a SimCluster representation of interaction signals to model negative behavior like abuse and blocks. It can be used in a larger project to identify and prevent abusive behavior on a social media platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- The purpose of this code is to build a SimCluster representation of interaction signals to model negative behavior like abuse and blocks. It computes a score for every SimCluster and creates a representation of the user so that the new SimCluster scores are an estimate of the interactions for this user.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `computeClusterFeatures` function?
- The inputs of the `computeClusterFeatures` function are a sparse matrix of User-SimCluster scores and a graph of interactions. The sparse matrix should already be L2 normalized. The output is a TypedPipe of SingleSideClusterFeatures for each SimCluster that has a user with an interaction.

3. What is the purpose of the `pairScores` function and what does it return?
- The purpose of the `pairScores` function is to combine all the different SimClustersEmbedding for a user into one AdhocSingleSideClusterScores. It takes a map of interaction types and their corresponding user interaction features and returns a TypedPipe with one AdhocSingleSideClusterScores per user.
