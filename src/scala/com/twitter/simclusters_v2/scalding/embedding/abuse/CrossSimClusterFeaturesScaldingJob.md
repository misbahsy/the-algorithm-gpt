The code defines two objects: `CrossSimClusterFeaturesUtil` and `CrossSimClusterFeaturesScaldingJob`. 

The `CrossSimClusterFeaturesUtil` object contains a single method, `getCrossClusterScores`, which takes two sparse matrices as input: `userClusterMatrix` and `userInteractionMatrix`. The method computes the interaction score for two simclusters `c1` and `c2` for all cluster combinations `(I)`. It does this by first computing the matrix product of the transpose of `userClusterMatrix` and `userInteractionMatrix`, which results in an intermediate matrix. It then computes the matrix product of the intermediate matrix and `userClusterMatrix`, which results in the final matrix of cross-cluster scores. The method returns this final matrix.

The `CrossSimClusterFeaturesScaldingJob` object defines a Scalding job that generates cross-simcluster interaction scores for two types of interactions: negative user-user interactions (block interactions) and positive user-user interactions (fav interactions). The job takes two arguments: `date` and `dalEnvironment`. It uses these arguments to generate the paths for the output files that will contain the cross-simcluster interaction scores.

The job first calls the `getUserInterestedInTruncatedKMatrix` method to get a sparse matrix of user interestedIn simclusters. It then normalizes this matrix by row using the `rowL2Normalize` method. 

Next, the job calls the `getFlockBlocksSparseMatrix` method to get a sparse matrix of negative user-user interactions (block interactions). It then calls the `getCrossClusterScores` method to compute the cross-simcluster interaction scores for block interactions. The job uses the resulting matrix to generate a `TypedPipe` of `AdhocCrossSimClusterInteractionScores` objects, which contain the cross-simcluster interaction scores for block interactions.

The job then calls the `ExternalDataSources.getFavEdges` method to get a sparse matrix of positive user-user interactions (fav interactions). It then calls the `getCrossClusterScores` method to compute the cross-simcluster interaction scores for fav interactions. The job uses the resulting matrix to generate another `TypedPipe` of `AdhocCrossSimClusterInteractionScores` objects, which contain the cross-simcluster interaction scores for fav interactions.

Finally, the job writes both the block and fav interaction matrices to HDFS in thrift format using the `writeDALSnapshotExecution` method. 

Overall, this code generates cross-simcluster interaction scores for two types of interactions and writes them to HDFS. These scores can be used in downstream applications to identify patterns of interaction between simclusters and to make recommendations based on those patterns.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `getCrossClusterScores` function?
- The `getCrossClusterScores` function is used to generate the interaction score for two simclusters for all cluster combinations by computing the product of three matrices.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `getCrossClusterScores` function?
- The inputs of the `getCrossClusterScores` function are two sparse matrices: `userClusterMatrix` and `userInteractionMatrix`. The output of the function is also a sparse matrix of type `SparseMatrix[ClusterId, ClusterId, Double]`.

3. What is the purpose of the `CrossSimClusterFeaturesScaldingJob` object?
- The `CrossSimClusterFeaturesScaldingJob` object is used to run an adhoc Scalding job that generates cross-simcluster interaction scores for two types of user interactions (positive and negative) and writes the results to HDFS in thrift format.
