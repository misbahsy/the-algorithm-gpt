This code defines a Scalding job that generates user topic embeddings based on the Topic-Follow-Graph (TFG) and user engagement data. The purpose of this job is to create a new set of embeddings that represent user interests in various topics, weighted by their engagement (favorites) with those topics.

The main logic of the job is implemented in the `prepareUserToTopicEmbedding` function, which takes two input datasets: `favTfgTopicEmbeddings` (topic embeddings from the TFG) and `userTopicEngagementCount` (user engagement data). The function first filters the top K topics for each user based on their engagement count. Then, it normalizes the engagement count for each user and computes the weighted sum of the TFG embeddings for each user, resulting in a new set of user topic embeddings.

The `writeOutput` function is responsible for writing the generated user topic embeddings to the specified output paths in both KeyVal and Parquet formats. The output data includes the user ID, the language, and the weighted embedding map for each user.

The `runOnDateRange` function orchestrates the entire process by reading the input datasets, preparing the user topic embeddings, and writing the output. It also defines various statistics to monitor the progress of the job, such as the number of user topic engagements, user languages, and TFG embeddings.

This job can be run in two modes: ad-hoc and scheduled. The `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsAdhocJob` object is used for running the job in ad-hoc mode, while the `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsScheduleJob` object is used for running the job in scheduled mode. Both modes share the same base logic implemented in the `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsBaseJob` trait.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsBaseJob` trait and how is it used in the code?

   **Answer:** The `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsBaseJob` trait defines the common functionality for generating engagement-weighted Topic-Follow-Graph (TFG) topic embeddings. It is used as a mixin for the `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsAdhocJob` and `EngagementWeightedTfgBasedTopicEmbeddingsScheduleJob` objects, which are the ad-hoc and scheduled versions of the job, respectively.

2. **Question:** How are the top K topics selected for each user in the `prepareUserToTopicEmbedding` function?

   **Answer:** The top K topics for each user are selected by first grouping the user topic engagement data by the user and language, then sorting the topics in descending order of their favorite count, and finally taking the top K topics using the `sortedReverseTake` function.

3. **Question:** How is the output data written in the `writeOutput` function and what are the output formats?

   **Answer:** The output data is written in two formats: KeyVal and Parquet. The KeyVal output is written using the `writeDALVersionedKeyValExecution` function, while the Parquet output is written using the `writeDALSnapshotExecution` function. Both outputs are written to the specified output paths, with the KeyVal output being written to `outputPath` and the Parquet output being written to `parquetOutputPath`.
