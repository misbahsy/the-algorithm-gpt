The `GlobalSimClustersLanguageEmbeddingBatchApp` is a Scala object that contains the implementation of a batch application that generates embeddings for SimClusters. SimClusters is a Twitter project that clusters users based on their interests. The embeddings generated by this application are used to represent the interests of users in different languages. The embeddings are generated by computing the average score of each cluster that a user is interested in, weighted by the user's engagement with tweets related to that cluster. The application reads data from different sources, including a snapshot of the most recent user interests, user-tweet engagement history, and user language information. The application then processes this data to generate embeddings for each language. The embeddings are written to two different datasets, one as a key-value dataset and the other as a thrift dataset.

The `runOnDateRange` method is the entry point of the application. It takes an argument of type `Args` and returns an `Execution` object. The `runOnDateRange` method reads the most recent user interests snapshot from the past 21 days, user-tweet engagement history from the past 2 days, and user language information. It then calls the `getGlobalSimClustersEmbeddingPerLanguage` method to generate embeddings for each language. The `getGlobalSimClustersEmbeddingPerLanguage` method takes three arguments: flattened and filtered user interests, user-tweet engagement history, and user language information. It then computes the embeddings for each language by computing the average score of each cluster that a user is interested in, weighted by the user's engagement with tweets related to that cluster. The embeddings are then written to two different datasets, one as a key-value dataset and the other as a thrift dataset.

The `GlobalSimClustersLanguageEmbeddingBatchApp` object also contains several constants and helper methods. The `outputHdfsDirectory` and `outputThriftHdfsDirectory` constants specify the HDFS directories where the embeddings will be written. The `numOfClustersPerLanguage` constant specifies the number of clusters to include in the embeddings for each language. The `getInterestedInFn` method returns a function that takes a date range and a time zone and returns a `TypedPipe` of user interests. The `flattenAndFilterUserInterestedIn` method takes a `TypedPipe` of user interests and returns a flattened and filtered `TypedPipe` of user interests. The `getGlobalSimClustersEmbeddingPerLanguage` method takes three arguments and returns a `TypedPipe` of embeddings for each language.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code generates SimClusters embeddings per language based on user-tweet engagements and user interests.
2. What external data sources are being used in this code?
- The code uses InterestedInSources, ExternalDataSources.userTweetFavoritesSource, and ExternalDataSources.userSource.
3. What is the output format of the results and where are they stored?
- The results are stored as both a key-val dataset and a thrift dataset, and they are stored in the HDFS directories specified by outputHdfsDirectory and outputThriftHdfsDirectory, respectively.
