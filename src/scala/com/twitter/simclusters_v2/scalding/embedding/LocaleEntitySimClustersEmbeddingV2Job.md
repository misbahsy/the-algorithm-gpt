This code defines a Scalding job that generates topic embeddings per locale based on Entity Real Graph (ERG). The job is designed to run in production and is scheduled to run daily. The embeddings are generated using a log transform of the ERG favScores and the SimCluster InterestedIn scores. The resulting embeddings are written to two index files: noun-to-cluster and cluster-to-noun. These index files are used to look up the most relevant clusters for a given noun and vice versa.

The `LocaleEntitySimClustersEmbeddingV2ScheduledApp` object is the main entry point for the scheduled job. It extends the `LocaleEntitySimClustersEmbeddingV2Job` trait, which defines the core logic for generating the embeddings. The `LocaleEntitySimClustersEmbeddingV2AdhocApp` object is used for ad-hoc runs of the job.

The `LocaleEntitySimClustersEmbeddingV2Job` trait defines two methods for writing the noun-to-cluster and cluster-to-noun index files. These methods take a `TypedPipe` of `(LocaleEntity, Seq[(ClusterId, Double)])` and `(ClusterId, Seq[(LocaleEntity, Double)])`, respectively. The `LocaleEntity` type is a tuple of `(String, String)`, where the first string is an entity ID and the second string is a language code. The `ClusterId` type is a string that uniquely identifies a cluster.

The `prepareNounToUserMatrix` method is used to prepare the input matrix for generating the embeddings. It reads data from the ERG and user sources and returns a `SparseMatrix` of `(LocaleEntity, UserId, Double)`. The `prepareUserToClusterMatrix` method is used to prepare the output matrix for generating the embeddings. It reads data from the SimCluster source and returns a `SparseRowMatrix` of `(UserId, ClusterId, Double)`.

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project for generating topic embeddings based on ERG and SimCluster data. The resulting embeddings can be used for various applications, such as content recommendation and search.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code generates topic embeddings per locale based on Entity Real Graph using log transform of the ERG favScores and the SimCluster InterestedIn scores.
2. What are the input and output data formats for this code?
- The input data format is a combination of SemanticCoreEntity and EntityRealGraph data sources, while the output data format is SimClustersEmbedding.
3. What are the parameters and configurations that can be adjusted in this code?
- The numClustersPerNoun, numNounsPerClusters, and thresholdForEmbeddingScores parameters can be adjusted, as well as the numReducersOpt configuration. Additionally, the code can be run as a scheduled production job or an adhoc execution job.
