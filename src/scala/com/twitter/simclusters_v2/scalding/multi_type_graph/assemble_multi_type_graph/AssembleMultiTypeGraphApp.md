This code defines two objects, `AssembleMultiTypeGraphAdhocApp` and `AssembleMultiTypeGraphBatchApp`, which are used to assemble a multi-type graph from various data sources. The purpose of the multi-type graph is to represent relationships between different types of entities, such as users, tweets, and hashtags, in a single graph structure. The graph is constructed using data stored in various datasets, including `TruncatedMultiTypeGraphAdhocScalaDataset`, `TopKRightNounsAdhocScalaDataset`, and `FullMultiTypeGraphAdhocScalaDataset`.

The `AssembleMultiTypeGraphAdhocApp` object is used for ad-hoc execution of the graph assembly process, while the `AssembleMultiTypeGraphBatchApp` object is used for scheduled execution. Both objects extend the `AssembleMultiTypeGraphBaseApp` trait, which defines common functionality for assembling the graph.

The `AssembleMultiTypeGraphAdhocApp` object defines several properties that are used to configure the assembly process, including the output paths for the truncated and full multi-type graphs, and the datasets used to store the truncated graph and top K right nouns. It also sets the `isAdhoc` property to `true`, indicating that this is an ad-hoc execution.

The `AssembleMultiTypeGraphBatchApp` object is similar to the `AssembleMultiTypeGraphAdhocApp` object, but is used for scheduled execution. It sets the `isAdhoc` property to `false`, and defines additional properties for scheduling the execution, including the `firstTime` and `batchIncrement` properties.

Overall, these objects provide a way to assemble a multi-type graph from various data sources, and can be used as part of a larger project to analyze relationships between different types of entities on Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and appears to be related to assembling a multi-type graph. It imports various libraries and defines two objects, `AssembleMultiTypeGraphAdhocApp` and `AssembleMultiTypeGraphBatchApp`, which extend `AssembleMultiTypeGraphBaseApp` and implement different execution modes (adhoc and batch).
2. What are the input and output formats for this code?
- It is unclear from this code what the input and output formats are, as the code mainly defines objects and their properties. However, there are references to various datasets and output paths, which suggest that the input and output formats may involve key-value pairs, Thrift, and/or HDFS.
3. What are the dependencies required to run this code?
- This code has several dependencies, including libraries such as `com.twitter.scalding`, `com.twitter.dal`, and `com.twitter.simclusters_v2`, as well as other components such as `AdhocExecutionApp` and `ScheduledExecutionApp`. It is also designed to be run remotely using Scalding.
