The `AssembleMultiTypeGraph` object in this code is responsible for constructing a multi-type graph based on various user interactions on Twitter. The graph is composed of left nodes representing users and right nodes representing different types of interactions, such as tweets, favorites, follows, blocks, etc. The edges between the nodes have associated weights that indicate the strength of the interaction.

The code provides several methods to create subgraphs based on different types of interactions:

- `getUserTweetInteractionGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on tweet interactions (favorites, replies, retweets).
- `getUserFavGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user-to-user favorite interactions.
- `getUserFollowGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user-to-user follow interactions.
- `getUserBlockGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user-to-user block interactions.
- `getUserAbuseReportGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user-to-user abuse report interactions.
- `getUserSpamReportGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user-to-user spam report interactions.
- `getUserSignUpCountryGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user sign-up country information.
- `getUserConsumedLanguagesGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user consumed language information.
- `getUserTopicFollowGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user-to-topic follow interactions.
- `getMagicRecsNotifOpenOrClickTweetsGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user interactions with Magic Recs notifications.
- `getSearchGraph`: Creates a subgraph based on user search query interactions.

The `getFullGraph` method combines all these subgraphs into a single graph. Additionally, the code provides methods to filter out invalid users, truncate the graph based on top K right nodes, and build an employee graph for analysis purposes.

This multi-type graph can be used in the larger project for various purposes, such as user clustering, recommendation systems, or analyzing user behavior patterns on the platform.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `AssembleMultiTypeGraph` object and its functions?
   **Answer**: The `AssembleMultiTypeGraph` object is responsible for assembling a multi-type graph from various data sources such as tweet interactions, user-user relationships, user-topic relationships, and user-search queries. It contains several functions to process and filter the data, and then combine them into a single graph representation.

2. **Question**: How does the `getUserTweetInteractionGraph` function work and what is its output?
   **Answer**: The `getUserTweetInteractionGraph` function takes a `TypedPipe[InteractionEvent]` as input, which represents tweet interaction events. It processes these events to extract user-tweet interactions such as favorites, replies, and retweets. The output is a `TypedPipe[(LeftNode, RightNodeWithEdgeWeight)]`, which represents the user-tweet interaction graph with edge weights.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `filterInvalidUsers` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `filterInvalidUsers` function is used to filter out invalid user relationships from the input `TypedPipe[(UserId, UserId)]`, which represents user-user relationships such as follows, blocks, or abuse reports. It takes a `TypedPipe[UserId]` of valid users as input and filters the relationships to only include those where both the source and destination users are valid. The output is a `TypedPipe[(UserId, UserId)]` containing only valid user relationships.
