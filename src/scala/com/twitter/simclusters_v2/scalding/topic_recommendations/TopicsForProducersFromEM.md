This code computes the top topics for a producer to be shown on the Topics To Follow Module on Profile Pages using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. The high-level purpose of this code is to provide personalized topic recommendations to users based on their interests and activities. 

The code takes in various inputs such as user-user normalized graph, followed topics to users, user source, user languages, minimum active followers for a producer, minimum topic follows threshold, lambda, and number of EM steps. It then obtains the background model distribution of the number of followers for a topic and the domain model distribution of the number of producer's followers who follow a topic. 

Iteratively, the code uses the Expectation-Maximization approach to get the best estimate of the domain model's topic distribution for a producer. For each producer, it only keeps its top K topics with the highest weights in the domain model's topic distribution after the EM step. The code also stores the locale info for each producer along with the topics. 

The code has two main objects: TopicsForProducersFromEMAdhocApp and TopicsForProducersFromEMBatchApp. TopicsForProducersFromEMAdhocApp is used for ad-hoc execution, while TopicsForProducersFromEMBatchApp is used for scheduled execution. Both objects call the same functions to obtain the top topics for producers. 

The function getTopLocaleTopicsForProducersFromEM takes in various inputs such as user-user graph, followed topics to users, user source, user languages, minimum active followers for a producer, minimum topic follows threshold, lambda, and number of EM steps. It then obtains the producer to users matrix and users to topics with locales matrix. The domain input probability distribution is the Map(topics->followers) per producer locale, and the background model is the Map(topics -> Expected value of the number of users who follow the topic). The function then estimates the domain model using the EM approach and returns the scored topics for each producer per locale. 

The function sortAndGetTopLocaleTopicsPerProducer takes in the producer to topics map and generates the sorted and truncated top locale topics ranked list for each producer. 

Overall, this code is an essential part of the larger project as it provides personalized topic recommendations to users, which can improve user engagement and satisfaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- The purpose of this code is to compute the top topics for a producer to be shown on the Topics To Follow Module on Profile Pages using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. It solves the problem of recommending relevant topics to producers based on their followers' interests.

2. What are the input data sources for this code?
- The input data sources for this code include user-user normalized graph, followed topics to users, user source, and inferred user consumed language source.

3. What is the output of this code and where is it stored?
- The output of this code is a list of top topics for each producer with their corresponding scores and locale information. It is stored in a TSV file located at the specified output directory. Additionally, the output is also stored in a DAL versioned key-value dataset.
