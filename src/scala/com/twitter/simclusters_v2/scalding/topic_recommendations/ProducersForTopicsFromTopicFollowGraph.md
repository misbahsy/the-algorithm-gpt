This code computes the top producers for a topic from the Topic Follow Graph. The purpose of this code is to generate a list of top producers for each topic locale. The code works as follows:

1. Producer embedding: List of users who follow the producer's profile and follow at least one topic.
2. Topic embedding: List of users who follow the topic.
3. Score(producer, topic) = cosine similarity of the producer and topic embedding as defined above.
4. The code computes the top producers for each topic locale.

The code consists of three objects: `ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphAdhocApp`, `ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphBatchApp`, and `ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraph`. 

`ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphAdhocApp` is an AdhocExecutionApp that runs on a given date range and computes the top producers for each topic locale. It takes the following arguments: `output_dir_producers_per_topic`, `minActiveFollowers`, `maxProducersPerTopic`, and `minTopicFollows`. It then calls the `sortAndGetTopProducersPerLocaleTopic` function to sort and truncate the top producers ranked list for each locale topic.

`ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphBatchApp` is a ScheduledExecutionApp that runs on a given date range and computes the top producers for each topic locale. It takes the same arguments as `ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphAdhocApp`. It then calls the `sortAndGetTopProducersPerLocaleTopic` function to sort and truncate the top producers ranked list for each locale topic. Finally, it writes the result to a DAL versioned key-value store.

`ProducersForTopicsFromTopicFollowGraph` contains the `sortAndGetTopProducersPerLocaleTopic` and `getTopicsFromProducersFollowers` functions. The `sortAndGetTopProducersPerLocaleTopic` function takes the producer to topics map and generates the sorted and truncated top producers ranked list for each locale topic. The `getTopicsFromProducersFollowers` function takes the user-user graph, followed topics to users, user source, user languages, minimum active followers for producer, and minimum topic follows as input. It then computes the producer to locale topics matrix and returns it as output.

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project as it helps to identify the top producers for each topic locale. This information can be used to recommend relevant content to users based on their interests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code computes the top producers for a topic from the Topic Follow Graph by using cosine similarity of producer and topic embeddings. It solves the problem of identifying the most relevant producers for a given topic.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of this code?
- The inputs are user and topic data sources, as well as various parameters such as minimum active followers for producers and minimum topic follows. The output is a list of top producers for each topic locale, written to a specified output directory.

3. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries such as Scalding, Bijection, and Twitter Reco's ThriftScala. It also uses various internal libraries and data sources specific to Twitter, such as the Topic Follow Graph and inferred user consumed language source.
