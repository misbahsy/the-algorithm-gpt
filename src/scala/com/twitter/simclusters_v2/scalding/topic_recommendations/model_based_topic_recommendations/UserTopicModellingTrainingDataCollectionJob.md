This code is part of a project that aims to generate topic recommendations for users based on their interests and preferences. The main purpose of this code is to obtain the training and test data for the model-based approach to topic recommendations. The code reads data from various sources, processes it, and generates DataRecords for training and testing.

The `UserTopicModellingJobUtils` object contains the main functions for processing the data. The `run` function takes various TypedPipes as input, such as `topicFollowGraphSource`, `notInterestedTopicsSource`, `userSource`, `userInterestedInData`, and `topicPerLanguageEmbeddings`. It processes these inputs and returns a tuple containing training data samples, testing data samples, and a sorted vocabulary of topics.

The `splitByUser` function splits the data samples into training and testing sets based on the user_id, ensuring that the same user's data records are not part of both sets. The `getTargetTopicsFromTFG` function obtains the target topic for each training data sample for a user from the TopicFollowGraph. The `getFeaturesIntermediateJoin` function performs intermediate join operations between a user's followed, not-interested, interestedIn, country, and language TypedPipes, read from different sources.

The `getDataSamplesFromTrainingData` function generates the `UserTopicTrainingSample` for each DataRecord by aggregating user's followed topics, not-interested topics, country, language, and other features. The `getTrainTestExec` function writes the train and test data to the specified output paths.

The `UserTopicFeatureHydrationAdhocApp` and `UserTopicFeatureHydrationScheduledApp` objects are used to run the code on a specified date range, either as an ad-hoc execution or as a scheduled execution. They call the `UserTopicModellingJobUtils.run` function and write the resulting training and testing data to the specified output directories.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `UserTopicFeatureHydrationAdhocApp` and `UserTopicFeatureHydrationScheduledApp` objects in this code?
   
   **Answer**: The `UserTopicFeatureHydrationAdhocApp` object is used to run the job for obtaining the training and test data for the model-based approach to topic recommendations in an ad-hoc manner. The `UserTopicFeatureHydrationScheduledApp` object is used to run the same job in a scheduled manner, with a specified batch increment and start time.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `splitByUser` function in the `UserTopicModellingJobUtils` object?

   **Answer**: The `splitByUser` function is used to split the data samples based on user_id into train and test data. This ensures that the same user's data records are not part of both train and test data, preventing data leakage.

3. **Question**: How are the average embeddings for followed and not-interested topics calculated in the `getDataSamplesFromTrainingData` function?

   **Answer**: The average embeddings for followed and not-interested topics are calculated by summing up the simcluster embeddings for each topic in the respective sets (followed or not-interested) and then dividing the sum by the size of the respective sets.
