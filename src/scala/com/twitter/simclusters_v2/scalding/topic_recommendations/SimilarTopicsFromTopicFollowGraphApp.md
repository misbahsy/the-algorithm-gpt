The code in this file computes the similarities between topics based on how often they are co-followed by users. The high-level purpose of this code is to recommend similar topics to users based on their interests. 

The code works as follows:
1. It first reads the dataset of user to topics follow graph and constructs a sparse matrix M with N rows and K columns, where N is the number of users, and K is the number of topics. In the matrix, M(u,i) = 1 if user u follows topic i; otherwise, it is 0. In the sparse matrix, only non-zero elements are saved.
2. L2-normalization is done for each column of the matrix M to get a normalized version M'.
3. Topic-topic similarity matrix S = M'.transpose.multiply(M') is obtained. The resulting matrix will contain the similarities between all topics, i.e., S(i,j) is the similarity mentioned above.
4. For each topic, only its K similar topics with the largest similarity scores are kept, while not including those with scores lower than a threshold.

The `computeSimilarTopics` function takes four arguments: `userTopicsFollowGraph`, `followableTopics`, `numSimilarTopics`, and `scoreThreshold`. `userTopicsFollowGraph` is a `TypedPipe` of `(UserId, Map[SemanticCoreEntityId, Double])` tuples that represent the user to topics follow graph. `followableTopics` is a `TypedPipe` of `SemanticCoreEntityId` that represents the followable topics. `numSimilarTopics` is an integer that represents the number of similar topics to keep for each topic. `scoreThreshold` is a double that represents the threshold for the similarity score.

The `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphScheduledApp` and `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphAdhocApp` objects are used to run the code in a scheduled and ad-hoc manner, respectively. The `firstTime` and `batchIncrement` methods in `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphScheduledApp` are used to specify the start date and batch increment for the scheduled execution. The `runOnDateRange` method in both objects is used to execute the `computeSimilarTopics` function and write the results to a DAL versioned key-value store or a TSV file, respectively.

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project that recommends similar topics to users based on their interests. It uses a user to topics follow graph to compute the similarities between topics and recommends similar topics to users based on these similarities.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code computes the similarities between topics based on how often they are co-followed by users. It solves the problem of recommending similar topics to users based on their interests.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies such as Scalding, Escherbird, interests_ds, and recos.

3. What is the difference between the `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphScheduledApp` and `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphAdhocApp` objects?
- `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphScheduledApp` is a scheduled execution app that runs on a specific date range and writes the output to a DAL versioned key-value store. On the other hand, `SimilarTopicsFromTopicFollowGraphAdhocApp` is an adhoc execution app that takes command-line arguments and writes the output to a typed TSV file.
