The `MultiTypeGraphStore` object contains methods for retrieving various types of data from a Manhattan key-value store. The purpose of this code is to provide access to different types of data that are used in the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The object contains several implicit conversions that use the `CompactScalaCodec` to convert different types of objects to and from byte arrays. These conversions are used to store and retrieve data from the Manhattan key-value store. 

The methods in the object are used to retrieve different types of data from the Manhattan key-value store. For example, `getTruncatedMultiTypeGraphRightNodesForUser` retrieves a `ReadableStore` of `LeftNode` and `RightNodeWithEdgeWeightList` pairs. Similarly, `getTopKNounsForRightNodeType` retrieves a `ReadableStore` of `RightNodeTypeStruct` and `NounWithFrequencyList` pairs. 

Other methods in the object retrieve `ReadableStore`s of `SimilarRightNodes`, `CandidateTweetsList`, `TopKTweetsWithScores`, and `ClustersUserIsInterestedIn` objects. These methods are used to retrieve data that is used in different parts of the larger project. 

Overall, the `MultiTypeGraphStore` object provides a convenient way to retrieve different types of data from the Manhattan key-value store. The implicit conversions and `ReadableStore` methods make it easy to work with the data in the larger project. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.storage.client.manhattan.kv.ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams

// create ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams object
val mhMtlsParams = ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams()

// retrieve a ReadableStore of LeftNode and RightNodeWithEdgeWeightList pairs
val truncatedGraphStore = MultiTypeGraphStore.getTruncatedMultiTypeGraphRightNodesForUser(mhMtlsParams)

// retrieve a ReadableStore of RightNodeTypeStruct and NounWithFrequencyList pairs
val topKNounsStore = MultiTypeGraphStore.getTopKNounsForRightNodeType(mhMtlsParams)

// retrieve a ReadableStore of FullClusterId and TopKTweetsWithScores pairs
val videoViewBasedStore = MultiTypeGraphStore.getVideoViewBasedClusterTopKTweets(mhMtlsParams)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines an object called MultiTypeGraphStore that contains methods for retrieving various types of data from a Manhattan key-value store. The data includes information about clusters, tweets, and user interests.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries, including com.twitter.bijection, com.twitter.simclusters_v2, com.twitter.storage.client.manhattan.kv, com.twitter.storehaus, com.twitter.storehaus_internal.manhattan, and com.twitter.scalding_internal.multiformat.format.keyval.

3. What types of data can be retrieved using the methods in this object?
- The methods in this object can be used to retrieve several types of data, including truncated multi-type graph right nodes for a user, top-k nouns for a right node type, top-k similar right nodes, candidate tweets, and top-k tweets with scores for various types of clusters. The object also includes a method for retrieving global simclusters language embeddings.
