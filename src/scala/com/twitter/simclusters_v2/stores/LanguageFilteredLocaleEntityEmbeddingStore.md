The `LanguageFilteredLocaleEntityEmbeddingStore` class is designed to transfer a `SimClustersEmbedding` to a language-filtered embedding. The new embedding only contains clusters whose main language is the same as the language field in the `SimClustersEmbeddingId`. This store is specifically designed for Topic Tweet and Topic Follow Prompt and only supports new Ids whose `internalId` is `LocaleEntityId`.

The class takes in three parameters: `underlyingStore`, `clusterDetailsStore`, and `composeKeyMapping`. `underlyingStore` is a `ReadableStore` that stores `SimClustersEmbeddingId` and `SimClustersEmbedding`. `clusterDetailsStore` is a `ReadableStore` that stores `(ModelVersion, ClusterId)` and `ClusterDetails`. `composeKeyMapping` is a function that maps `SimClustersEmbeddingId` to `SimClustersEmbeddingId`.

The `get` method takes a `SimClustersEmbeddingId` as input and returns a `Future` of an optional `SimClustersEmbedding`. It first gets the `SimClustersEmbedding` from the `underlyingStore` using the `composeKeyMapping` function. If the `SimClustersEmbedding` is found, it filters the clusters based on the language of the `SimClustersEmbeddingId` using the `embeddingsLanguageFilter` method. If the `SimClustersEmbedding` is not found, it returns `Future.None`.

The `embeddingsLanguageFilter` method takes a `SimClustersEmbeddingId` and a `SimClustersEmbedding` as input and returns a `Future` of a `SimClustersEmbedding`. It first gets the language and model version from the `SimClustersEmbeddingId`. It then gets the cluster detail keys from the `SimClustersEmbedding` and retrieves the corresponding `ClusterDetails` from the `clusterDetailsStore`. It filters the embedding based on the dominant language of each cluster using the `isDominantLanguage` method. Finally, it returns a new `SimClustersEmbedding` with the filtered clusters.

The `isDominantLanguage` method takes a language and a `ClusterDetails` as input and returns a boolean. It first gets the dominant language of the `ClusterDetails`. It then checks if the dominant language is the same as the requested language.

The `getLanguage` method takes a `SimClustersEmbeddingId` as input and returns a string representing the language of the `SimClustersEmbeddingId`. It extracts the language from the `LocaleEntityId` of the `SimClustersEmbeddingId`.

Overall, this class is used to filter a `SimClustersEmbedding` based on the language of the `SimClustersEmbeddingId`. It is designed for Topic Tweet and Topic Follow Prompt and only supports new Ids whose `internalId` is `LocaleEntityId`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a deprecated store that filters a SimClustersEmbedding to only contain clusters whose main language matches the language field in the SimClustersEmbeddingId. It is designed for Topic Tweet and Topic Follow Prompt and only supports new Ids whose internalId is LocaleEntityId.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including ClusterId, SimClustersEmbedding, ClusterDetails, InternalId, ModelVersion, SimClustersEmbeddingId, ReadableStore, and Future.

3. What is the meaning of the @deprecated annotation and why is it used here?
- The @deprecated annotation indicates that this code is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It is used here to indicate that this store is no longer supported and should not be used going forward.
