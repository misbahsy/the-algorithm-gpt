The `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` class is a facade for all SimClusters Embedding Stores. It provides a uniform access layer for all kinds of SimClusters Embedding. The class takes a map of `(EmbeddingType, ModelVersion)` to `ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding]` as input. The `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` class extends the `ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding]` trait, which requires the implementation of two methods: `get` and `multiGet`. 

The `get` method takes a `SimClustersEmbeddingId` as input and returns a `Future` of an `Option[SimClustersEmbedding]`. The method looks up the store that corresponds to the `SimClustersEmbeddingId` and returns the result of calling `get` on that store. If the store is not found, the method returns `Future.None`.

The `multiGet` method takes a set of `SimClustersEmbeddingId` as input and returns a map of `SimClustersEmbeddingId` to `Future[Option[SimClustersEmbedding]]`. The method groups the input `SimClustersEmbeddingId` by `(EmbeddingType, ModelVersion)` and looks up the corresponding store for each group. If a store is found, the method calls `multiGet` on that store with the corresponding `SimClustersEmbeddingId`. If a store is not found, the method returns a map of `SimClustersEmbeddingId` to `Future.None`.

The `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` class also has a private method `findStore` that takes a `SimClustersEmbeddingId` as input and returns the corresponding store. The method looks up the store that corresponds to the `SimClustersEmbeddingId` and returns it. If the store is not found, the method returns `None`.

The `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` object has a `buildWithDecider` method that takes a map of `(EmbeddingType, ModelVersion)` to `ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding]`, a `Decider`, and a `StatsReceiver` as input. The method wraps all stores in a `DeciderableReadableStore` and returns a `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` instance. The `DeciderableReadableStore` is created using the `DeciderGateBuilderWithIdHashing` class, which allows for lazy adding of decider config to enable/disable stores. The `DeciderableReadableStore` is created with the `ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding]` instance, a gate, and a `StatsReceiver`. The `gate` is created using the `DeciderKeyEnum` class, which is a set of `Value` instances that correspond to the `(EmbeddingType, ModelVersion)` keys in the input map. The `StatsReceiver` is created using the `embeddingType.name` and `modelVersion.name` as the scope. The `buildWithDecider` method returns a `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` instance that wraps all stores in `DeciderableReadableStore`. 

Overall, the `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` class provides a uniform access layer for all kinds of SimClusters Embedding. The `buildWithDecider` method allows for the creation of a `SimClustersEmbeddingStore` instance that wraps all stores in `DeciderableReadableStore`. This allows for the lazy adding of decider config to enable/disable stores.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a uniform access layer for all kinds of SimClusters Embedding, which is a type of data structure used for clustering similar items together. It solves the problem of having to access different stores for different types of embeddings.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.decider`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, `com.twitter.hermit.store.common`, `com.twitter.servo.decider`, and `com.twitter.storehaus`.

3. How does this code handle batch processing of multiple requests?
- This code overrides the `multiGet` method to handle batch processing of multiple requests for better performance. It checks if all the requests are for the same type and version of embedding, and if so, it queries the corresponding store for all the requests at once. Otherwise, it groups the requests by type and version, and queries each group separately.
