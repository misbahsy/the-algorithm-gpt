The `WtfMbcgStore` object in the `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.stores` package provides a method for retrieving a `ReadableStore` object that can be used to read data from a Manhattan key-value store. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to access a specific Manhattan key-value store that contains data related to the `CandidateSeq` type from the `com.twitter.wtf.candidate.thriftscala` package.

The `getWtfMbcgStore` method takes two parameters: `mhMtlsParams`, which is an instance of `ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams` that contains the necessary parameters for connecting to the Manhattan key-value store, and `datasetName`, which is a string that specifies the name of the dataset to read from. The method returns a `ReadableStore[Long, CandidateSeq]` object that can be used to read data from the specified Manhattan key-value store.

The `keyInj` and `valInj` implicit values are used to specify how the keys and values in the Manhattan key-value store should be serialized and deserialized. In this case, the keys are `Long` values that are serialized as big-endian byte arrays using the `Long2BigEndian` injection, and the values are `CandidateSeq` objects that are serialized using the `ScalaBinaryThrift` injection.

The `appId` value is a string that specifies the application ID to use when connecting to the Manhattan key-value store. This value is used in the `ManhattanROConfig` object that is passed to the `ManhattanRO.getReadableStoreWithMtls` method to specify the configuration for the Manhattan key-value store.

Overall, this code provides a simple way to retrieve a `ReadableStore` object that can be used to read data from a specific Manhattan key-value store that contains data related to the `CandidateSeq` type. This can be useful in a larger project that needs to access this data for various purposes, such as machine learning or recommendation systems. An example usage of this code might look like:

```
val mhMtlsParams = ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams(...)
val store = WtfMbcgStore.getWtfMbcgStore(mhMtlsParams, "my_dataset")
val data = store.get(1234L) // read data for key 1234
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines an object called WtfMbcgStore that provides a method for getting a ReadableStore of CandidateSeq objects from a Manhattan key-value store. It solves the problem of accessing and reading data from a Manhattan key-value store.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and what do they do?
- This code depends on several libraries including Scalding, Manhattan, and Thrift. Scalding is a Scala library for data processing, Manhattan is a key-value store, and Thrift is a serialization framework. The specific dependencies used in this code provide functionality for injecting keys and values into the Manhattan store and reading data from it.

3. What is the expected input and output of the getWtfMbcgStore method?
- The getWtfMbcgStore method expects a ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams object and a datasetName string as input. It returns a ReadableStore object that contains Long keys and CandidateSeq values. The ReadableStore can be used to read data from the Manhattan key-value store.
