The `CosineSimilarityUtil` object provides a set of utility functions for normalizing and calculating dot products between sparse vectors. These functions are useful for calculating cosine similarity between two vectors, which is a common measure of similarity used in information retrieval and recommendation systems.

The object contains several functions for calculating different types of norms for a given vector. These include `norm`, `logNorm`, and `expScaledNorm`, which calculate the L2 norm, log norm, and exponentially scaled norm of a vector, respectively. There are also corresponding functions for calculating these norms for an array of doubles. The `l1Norm` function calculates the L1 norm of a vector, which is the sum of the absolute values of its elements.

The `applyNorm` functions divide a vector by its norm to normalize it. The `normalize` functions normalize a vector and return a new vector with the same keys and values, but with a norm of 1. If the input vector is empty or its norm is 0, the original vector is returned. There are corresponding functions for normalizing an array of doubles.

The `dotProduct` functions calculate the dot product of two sparse vectors. The `dotProduct` function takes two maps from keys to values, while `dotProductForSortedClusterAndScores` takes four arrays of cluster ids and scores, sorted in ascending order by cluster id. The latter function is useful when the vectors are represented as arrays, as is often the case in large-scale machine learning applications.

Overall, the `CosineSimilarityUtil` object provides a set of useful utility functions for normalizing and calculating dot products between sparse vectors. These functions are used extensively in the larger project to calculate cosine similarity between different entities, such as users and items in a recommendation system.
