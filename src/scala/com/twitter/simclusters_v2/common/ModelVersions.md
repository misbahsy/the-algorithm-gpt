The `ModelVersions` object is a utility that provides functionality to convert SimClusters Model versions into different forms. This is required to register any new SimClusters Model version. The purpose of this object is to provide a centralized location for managing and accessing different versions of the SimClusters Model.

The object contains three constants that represent different versions of the SimClusters Model. These constants are used to identify the different versions of the model throughout the codebase. The object also contains an enumeration that is used for feature switching. The enumeration contains two values, `Model20M145K2020` and `Model20M145KUpdated`, which are used to identify the two most recent versions of the model. The enumeration also contains a map that maps the enumeration values to the corresponding `ModelVersion` values.

The object also contains two maps that are used to convert between different representations of the SimClusters Model version. The `StringToThriftModelVersions` map maps the string representation of the model version to the corresponding `ModelVersion` value. The `ThriftModelVersionToStrings` map maps the `ModelVersion` value to the corresponding string representation.

The object provides three methods for converting between different representations of the SimClusters Model version. The `toModelVersionOption` method takes a string representation of the model version and returns an `Option[ModelVersion]`. If the string representation is a valid model version, the method returns `Some(ModelVersion)`. Otherwise, it returns `None`. The `toModelVersion` method takes a string representation of the model version and returns the corresponding `ModelVersion` value. The `toKnownForModelVersion` method takes a `ModelVersion` value and returns the corresponding string representation.

Overall, the `ModelVersions` object provides a centralized location for managing and accessing different versions of the SimClusters Model. It provides functionality for converting between different representations of the model version, which is useful for feature switching and other purposes. The object can be used throughout the codebase to identify and work with different versions of the SimClusters Model. For example, the `AllModelVersions` constant can be used to get a set of all available model versions, and the `toModelVersion` method can be used to convert a string representation of the model version to the corresponding `ModelVersion` value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines utility functions to convert SimClusters Model versions into different forms and register new versions.

2. What are the available SimClusters Model versions?
   - The available SimClusters Model versions are Model20M145KDec11, Model20M145KUpdated, and Model20M145K2020.

3. How are the SimClusters Model versions represented in this code?
   - The SimClusters Model versions are represented as a Map of String to ModelVersion and a Set of Strings, and there are utility functions to convert between them.
