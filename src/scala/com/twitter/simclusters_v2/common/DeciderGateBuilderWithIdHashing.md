The code above defines a class called `DeciderGateBuilderWithIdHashing` that extends `DeciderGateBuilder`. This class is used to create a `Gate` object that can be used to control access to a resource based on a decider's availability. 

The `Decider` class is imported from the `com.twitter.decider` package, and the `DeciderGateBuilder` and `DeciderKeyName` classes are imported from the `com.twitter.servo.decider` package. The `Gate` class is imported from the `com.twitter.servo.util` package.

The `idGateWithHashing` method takes a `DeciderKeyName` object as a parameter and returns a `Gate` object. The `convertToHash` function is defined to convert an object of type `T` to a `Long` value. If the decider's availability is either fully on or off, the availability value is returned. Otherwise, the object's hash code is returned. 

The `idGate` method is called with the `key` parameter to get a `Gate` object. The `contramap` method is called on the `idGate` object with the `convertToHash` function as a parameter. This creates a new `Gate` object that maps the input values to their corresponding hash codes. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to control access to resources based on a decider's availability. The `Gate` object created by the `idGateWithHashing` method can be used to allow or deny access to a resource based on the hash code of the input value. This can be useful in situations where the decider's availability changes frequently and the resource needs to be accessed by multiple clients. 

Example usage:

```
val decider = new Decider()
val builder = new DeciderGateBuilderWithIdHashing(decider)
val key = new DeciderKeyName("my_key")
val gate = builder.idGateWithHashing[String](key)
if (gate.isOpen("my_value")) {
  // allow access to resource
} else {
  // deny access to resource
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a class called `DeciderGateBuilderWithIdHashing` that extends `DeciderGateBuilder` from the `com.twitter.servo.decider` package. It provides a method called `idGateWithHashing` that returns a `Gate` object with hashing applied to its input. It likely serves as a utility for some other part of the project that needs to use `Gate` objects with hashed input.

2. What is the `Decider` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `Decider` class is imported from the `com.twitter.decider` package and is passed as a parameter to the `DeciderGateBuilderWithIdHashing` class. It is not used directly in this code, but is likely used by the `DeciderGateBuilder` class that `DeciderGateBuilderWithIdHashing` extends.

3. What is the purpose of the `convertToHash` function and how does it work?
- The `convertToHash` function takes an object of type `T` and returns a `Long` value that is either the object's hash code or the availability value of a feature associated with a `DeciderKeyName`, depending on the availability value. This function is used to apply hashing to the input of a `Gate` object returned by the `idGateWithHashing` method.
