The `SimClustersEmbeddingId` object defines methods for building embedding IDs for different types of entities in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. Embedding IDs are used to represent high-dimensional vectors that encode semantic information about entities such as tweets, users, and topics. These vectors are used for various tasks such as content recommendation and similarity search.

The object defines several sets of `EmbeddingType`s, which are used to specify the type of embedding to build. For example, `TweetEmbeddingTypes` contains a set of `EmbeddingType`s that are used for building tweet embeddings. Similarly, `UserInterestedInEmbeddingTypes` contains a set of `EmbeddingType`s that are used for building user interest embeddings. Each set also defines a default `EmbeddingType` that is used if no type is specified.

The object provides several methods for building embedding IDs for different types of entities. For example, `buildTweetId` builds an embedding ID for a tweet given its ID, embedding type, and model version. Similarly, `buildUserInterestedInId` builds an embedding ID for a user interest given the user ID, embedding type, and model version. The other methods are `buildProducerId` for building producer embeddings, `buildLocaleEntityId` for building locale entity embeddings, and `buildTopicId` for building topic embeddings.

The object also defines two extractor objects, `LongInternalId` and `LongSimClustersEmbeddingId`, which are used to extract the long value from an `InternalId` or `ThriftSimClustersEmbeddingId` object, respectively. These are used for debugging purposes.

Finally, the object defines an `Ordering` for `InternalId` and `ThriftSimClustersEmbeddingId` objects, which is used for sorting and comparison. It also defines an `Enumeration` object `TopicEnum` that is used for feature switching.

Overall, the `SimClustersEmbeddingId` object provides a convenient way to build embedding IDs for different types of entities in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. These IDs are used extensively throughout the project for various tasks such as content recommendation and similarity search.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines an object called `SimClustersEmbeddingId` that contains methods for building different types of embedding IDs used in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. These embedding IDs are used to represent different types of data (e.g. tweets, users, topics) in a machine learning model.

2. What embedding types are available and what are their default values?
- The code defines several sets of embedding types for different types of data (e.g. tweets, users, topics) and their default values. For example, the default embedding type for tweets is `LogFavLongestL2EmbeddingTweet`.

3. What is the purpose of the `LongSimClustersEmbeddingId` object?
- The `LongSimClustersEmbeddingId` object is an extractor object that can be used to extract the `Long` value from an `InternalId` object that wraps a `Long`. This is used in the `simClustersEmbeddingIdOrdering` method to order `ThriftSimClustersEmbeddingId` objects based on their internal `Long` values.
