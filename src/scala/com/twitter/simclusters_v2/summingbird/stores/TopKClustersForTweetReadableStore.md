The code defines a set of classes and methods that are used to store and retrieve top K clusters for tweets. The `TopKClustersForTweetReadableStore` class is a `ReadableStore` that maps `TweetKey` objects to sequences of `(Int, Double)` tuples representing the top K clusters for the tweet. The `TweetKey` class is a case class that encapsulates the tweet ID, model version, embedding type, and half-life duration. The `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` class is a wrapper around a map of `ReadableStore` objects that maps `(EmbeddingType, String)` tuples to `ReadableStore` objects that store the top K clusters for tweets. The `defaultProxyMap` method returns a map of `ReadableStore` objects that use the production cache by default. The `defaultStore` method returns a `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` object that uses the default proxy map and half-life duration, and the `overrideLimitDefaultStore` method returns a `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` object that uses the default proxy map and half-life duration, but limits the number of results returned to a specified maximum.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and retrieve the top K clusters for tweets. This functionality is used in the larger project to provide recommendations for users based on their tweets and the tweets of other users. By storing the top K clusters for each tweet, the system can quickly retrieve the most relevant clusters for a given tweet and use them to make recommendations. The `TopKClustersForTweetReadableStore` class is used to store the top K clusters for each tweet, and the `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` class is used to retrieve them. The `defaultStore` and `overrideLimitDefaultStore` methods provide convenient ways to create instances of the `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` class with default or overridden parameters. Overall, this code provides an important piece of functionality for the larger project by enabling the efficient storage and retrieval of top K clusters for tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a set of classes and functions for storing and retrieving top K clusters for tweets in a readable store. It solves the problem of efficiently retrieving the most relevant clusters for a given tweet based on its embedding and model version.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Finagle, Summingbird, Thrift, and Storehaus. It also depends on internal libraries for SimClusters and ModelVersions.

3. What is the default behavior of the `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` and how can it be overridden?
- The default behavior of `TopKClustersForTweetKeyReadableStore` is to retrieve the top clusters for a tweet based on its favorite cluster normalized score. This can be overridden by passing a custom function to the constructor. Additionally, the maximum number of results can be limited by passing an integer to the constructor.
