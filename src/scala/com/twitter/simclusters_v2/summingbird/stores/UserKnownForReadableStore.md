The code defines a Scala object called `UserKnownForReadableStore` that provides a way to read data from three different versions of a key-value store. The key-value store contains information about clusters of users who are known for certain topics. The `UserKnownForReadableStore` object has two methods: `get` and `getDefaultStore`. 

The `get` method takes two arguments: an application ID and a set of ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams. It returns a new instance of `UserKnownForReadableStore` that is initialized with three different `ReadableStore` objects. Each `ReadableStore` object is created by calling the `buildForModelVersion` method, which takes an application ID, a store name, and a set of ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams. The `buildForModelVersion` method returns a `ReadableStore` object that can be used to read data from the key-value store. 

The `getDefaultStore` method takes a set of ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams and returns a new instance of `UserKnownForReadableStore` that is initialized with three different `ReadableStore` objects. The `getDefaultStore` method calls the `get` method with a default application ID of "simclusters_v2". 

The `UserKnownForReadableStore` case class takes three `ReadableStore` objects as arguments and implements the `ReadableStore` trait. The `ReadableStore` trait requires that the `get` method be implemented. The `get` method takes a `Query` object as an argument and returns a `Future` that contains an optional `ClustersUserIsKnownFor` object. The `Query` case class takes a user ID and a model version as arguments. The `get` method uses pattern matching to determine which `ReadableStore` object to use based on the model version specified in the `Query` object. If the model version is not recognized, an exception is thrown. 

This code is part of a larger project that likely involves processing data about Twitter users and their interests. The `UserKnownForReadableStore` object provides a way to read data from a key-value store that contains information about clusters of users who are known for certain topics. The `Query` case class provides a way to specify which user and which model version to retrieve data for. This code may be used in conjunction with other code that processes the data retrieved from the key-value store.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a ReadableStore for fetching clusters that a user is known for across different model versions.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including `com.twitter.bijection`, `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala`, and `com.twitter.storage.client.manhattan.kv`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `get` method in `UserKnownForReadableStore`?
- The `get` method in `UserKnownForReadableStore` expects a `Query` object containing a `userId` and `modelVersion`, and returns a `Future` containing an optional `ClustersUserIsKnownFor` object.
