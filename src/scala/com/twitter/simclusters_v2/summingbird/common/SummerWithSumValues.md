The code defines an implicit class called `SummerWithSumValues` that extends the `Summer` class from the Summingbird library. The purpose of this class is to provide a more convenient way to aggregate values in a store and continue processing with the aggregated value. 

The `sumValues` method defined in the `SummerWithSumValues` class takes a `Monoid` instance and returns a `KeyedProducer` instance. The `Monoid` instance is used to combine the existing value in the store with the delta value. The `KeyedProducer` instance is used to continue processing with the aggregated value.

The `sumValues` method is useful because the `sumByKeys` method in the Summingbird library returns the existing value from the store and the delta separately, leaving the user to manually combine them. The `sumValues` method simplifies this process by automatically combining the existing value and the delta using the `Monoid` instance.

Here is an example of how the `sumValues` method can be used:

```
import com.twitter.algebird._
import com.twitter.summingbird._

val score = "score"
val monoid = implicitly[Monoid[Int]]

val someKeyedProducer: KeyedProducer[Storm, String, Int] = ???

someKeyedProducer
  .sumByKeys(score)(monoid)
  .sumValues(monoid)
  .map {
    case (key, value) =>
      // `value` is the same as what was written to the store
  }
```

In this example, `score` is the name of the key used to aggregate the values, and `monoid` is an instance of the `Monoid` class that defines how to combine the values. The `someKeyedProducer` instance is a `KeyedProducer` that produces key-value pairs. The `sumByKeys` method is used to aggregate the values by key using the `score` key and the `monoid` instance. The `sumValues` method is then used to combine the existing value and the delta using the `monoid` instance. Finally, the `map` method is used to continue processing with the aggregated value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides an extension method `sumValues` for the `Summer` class in the Summingbird library, which simplifies the process of aggregating values in a store.

2. What is the `Monoid` class used for in this code?
    
    The `Monoid` class is used to combine values of the same type, which is necessary for aggregating values in the `sumValues` method.

3. How does the `sumValues` method differ from the `sumByKeys` method?
    
    The `sumValues` method combines the existing value in the store with the delta value, whereas the `sumByKeys` method returns them separately and requires manual combination.
