The `SimClustersHashUtil` object provides a hash function that maps an integer cluster ID to a bucket number. This function is used to batch together cluster IDs for processing. The `clusterIdToBucket` method takes an integer cluster ID as input and returns the corresponding bucket number. The bucket number is calculated by taking the modulo of the cluster ID with the total number of buckets, which is defined as a constant `numBuckets`. 

The `numBuckets` constant is set to 200, which means that there are 200 buckets available for clustering. This value can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the project. 

The `getAllBuckets` value is a sequence of integers that represents all the available buckets. It is generated using the `until` method, which creates a range of integers from 0 to `numBuckets - 1`. This sequence can be used to iterate over all the available buckets for processing. 

Overall, this code provides a simple hash function for clustering integer IDs into buckets. It can be used in conjunction with other algorithms and data structures to perform more complex clustering tasks. 

Example usage:

```scala
val clusterId = 12345
val bucket = SimClustersHashUtil.clusterIdToBucket(clusterId)
println(s"Cluster ID $clusterId is in bucket $bucket")
// Output: Cluster ID 12345 is in bucket 145
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code provides a hash function for mapping clusterIds to buckets and is used for batching clusterIds together in the SimClusters_v2 project.
   
2. What is the significance of the `numBuckets` variable and how was it determined?
   - The `numBuckets` variable represents the number of buckets that clusterIds will be mapped to. It was determined to be 200 in this implementation, but it's unclear how this value was chosen without further context.

3. Are there any potential issues with the hash function used in this code?
   - It's difficult to determine without more information about the specific use case, but one potential issue could be collisions where multiple clusterIds are mapped to the same bucket.
