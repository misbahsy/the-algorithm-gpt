This code is part of a larger project that deals with clustering and scoring of tweets. The main purpose of this code is to define various monoids that are used in the EntityJob. Monoids are algebraic structures that are used to combine values in a specific way. They are useful in distributed systems for aggregating data in a parallel and efficient manner.

The code defines several monoids for different purposes:

1. `ScoresMonoid`: This monoid is used to combine `Scores` objects, which contain two optional `ThriftDecayedValue` fields representing the favorite and follow cluster scores with an 8-hour half-life normalization. The monoid combines these scores by adding their respective values.

2. `ClustersWithScoresMonoid`: This monoid is used to combine `ClustersWithScores` objects, which contain a map of cluster IDs to their corresponding scores. The monoid combines these maps by adding the scores for each cluster ID.

3. `MultiModelClustersWithScoresMonoid`: This monoid is used to combine `MultiModelClustersWithScores` objects, which contain a map of model versions to their corresponding `ClustersWithScores`. The monoid combines these maps by using the `ClustersWithScoresMonoid` to add the scores for each model version.

4. `TopKClustersWithScoresMonoid`: This monoid is used to combine `TopKClustersWithScores` objects, which contain two maps of cluster IDs to their corresponding scores for favorite and follow clusters. The monoid combines these maps by merging the top K scores for each cluster ID, considering a given threshold.

5. `TopKTweetsWithScoresMonoid`: This monoid is used to combine `TopKTweetsWithScores` objects, which contain a map of tweet IDs to their corresponding scores for favorite clusters. The monoid combines these maps by merging the top K scores for each tweet ID, considering a given threshold and tweet age threshold.

6. `MultiModelTopKTweetsWithScoresMonoid`: This monoid is used to combine `MultiModelTopKTweetsWithScores` objects, which contain a map of model versions to their corresponding `TopKTweetsWithScores`. The monoid combines these maps by using the `TopKTweetsWithScoresMonoid` to add the scores for each model version.

7. `PersistentSimClustersEmbeddingMonoid` and `MultiModelPersistentSimClustersEmbeddingMonoid`: These monoids are used to combine `PersistentSimClustersEmbedding` and `MultiModelPersistentSimClustersEmbedding` objects, respectively. They merge the embeddings based on the latest update time or the longest L2 norm, depending on the specific monoid used.

The code also provides utility functions for merging top K scores with decayed values and for merging multi-model maps. These functions are used by the monoids to combine the data efficiently. Overall, this code plays a crucial role in aggregating and processing the clustering and scoring data in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Monoids` object and its various classes?
   **Answer**: The `Monoids` object contains various monoid classes used in the EntityJob. These monoid classes are used to combine different data structures like Scores, ClustersWithScores, MultiModelClustersWithScores, etc., in a specific way defined by their respective `plus` methods.

2. **Question**: How does the `TopKScoresUtils.mergeTwoTopKMapWithDecayedValues` function work?
   **Answer**: The `mergeTwoTopKMapWithDecayedValues` function merges two TopK maps with decayed values. It first decays all the values to the latest scaled timestamp to make them comparable. Then, it compares and merges the values based on their keys and values, keeping only the values larger than the threshold. Finally, if the merged map size is larger than TopK, it keeps only the topK largest values.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `MultiModelUtils.mergeTwoMultiModelMaps` function?
   **Answer**: The `mergeTwoMultiModelMaps` function is used to merge two MultiModel maps by using the Monoid for the value to combine the maps. It takes two maps and a monoid as input and returns a new map with the combined values according to the monoid's `plus` method.
