This code is a Bash script that deploys a Storm job called `tweet-simclusters-storm-job` to a Continuous Integration (CI) environment. The script takes two optional arguments: `--env` and `--dc`. The `--env` argument specifies the environment to deploy to, which can be either `devel` or `prod`. The `--dc` argument specifies the data center to deploy to, which can be either `atla` or `pdxa`. If no arguments are provided, the script will print a usage message and exit.

The script first changes the current directory to the root of the Git repository using the `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` command. It then sources a shell script called `source-sh-setup` located in the `devprod` directory of the repository. This script likely contains environment variables and other configuration settings needed to deploy the job.

The script then uses a `while` loop to parse the command-line arguments. If the `--dc` argument is provided, its value is stored in the `CLUSTER` variable. If the `--env` argument is provided, its value is stored in the `ENV` variable. Any other arguments are ignored.

The script then creates a tar archive of the `tweet-simclusters-storm-job` using the `bazel bundle` command. The resulting archive is stored in the `dist` directory of the repository.

The script then sets the `AURORA_PATH` variable to a string in the format `<dc>/<user>/<env>`, where `<dc>` is the data center specified by the `--dc` argument (or the default value), `<user>` is the username `cassowary`, and `<env>` is the environment specified by the `--env` argument (or the default value). The script then sets the `AURORA_JOB_KEY` variable to a string in the format `<AURORA_PATH>/summingbird_simclusters_v2_tweet_alt_job_<ENV>`, where `<AURORA_PATH>` is the value of the `AURORA_PATH` variable, and `<ENV>` is the value of the `ENV` variable.

The script then uses the `heron kill` command to stop any running instances of the job. It waits for 5 seconds to ensure that the job has stopped. Finally, it uses the `heron submit` command to start a new instance of the job, passing in the values of the `ENV` and `CLUSTER` variables as command-line arguments.

Overall, this script automates the deployment of the `tweet-simclusters-storm-job` to a CI environment, making it easier for developers to test and debug the job.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to deploy a simcluster storm job to CI.

2. What are the valid values for the `--dc` and `--env` options?
   
   The `--dc` option can be set to either "atla" or "pdxa", while the `--env` option can be set to either "devel" or "prod".

3. What is the `heron` command doing?
   
   The `heron` command is being used to kill a previously running job, wait for it to stop, and then submit a new job with the specified parameters.
