This is a Bash script that deploys a persistent storm job for the SimClusters project to a Continuous Integration (CI) environment. The script takes command-line arguments for the environment (`devel` or `prod`) and the data center (`atla` or `pdxa`). It uses the `git` command to navigate to the root directory of the project and sources a shell setup script. 

The script defines a `usage` function that prints out the expected command-line arguments. If the script is called with fewer than one argument, it calls the `usage` function and exits with an error code. 

The script then sets some variables for the data center, environment, and user (`cassowary`). It bundles the `persistent-tweet-simclusters-storm-job` using the `bazel` build tool and saves it as a `.tar` file. It then initializes the Aurora path for a Heron job, which is a distributed stream processing engine. The Aurora path is set to `<dc>/<role>/<env>`, where `<env>` can only be `devel` or `prod`. The script then kills any existing Heron job with the same name and waits for 5 seconds to ensure it is dead. Finally, it submits the bundled `.tar` file to Heron using the `heron submit` command, passing in the environment and data center as arguments.

This script is used to automate the deployment of the SimClusters persistent storm job to a CI environment. It can be run manually or as part of a larger deployment pipeline. Here is an example of how the script might be called:

```
./deploy-simclusters.sh --env prod --dc atla
```

This would deploy the SimClusters persistent storm job to the `prod` environment in the `atla` data center.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to deploy a persistent storm job to CI for the SimClusters project at Twitter.

2. What are the valid values for the `--env` and `--dc` options?
   
   The `--env` option can be set to either `devel` or `prod`, while the `--dc` option can be set to either `atla` or `pdxa`.

3. What is the significance of the `heron kill` command in this script?
   
   The `heron kill` command is used to stop any existing instances of the persistent storm job before starting a new one.
