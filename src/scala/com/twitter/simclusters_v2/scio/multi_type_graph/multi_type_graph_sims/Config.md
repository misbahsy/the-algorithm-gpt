The code defines a Scala object called `Config` that contains configuration settings for two different jobs related to multi-type graph similarity calculations. The first job is called `RightNodeSimHashScioBaseApp` and the second job is called `RightNodeCosineSimilarityScioBaseApp`.

For the `RightNodeSimHashScioBaseApp` job, the configuration settings include the number of hashes to generate in the sketch (`numHashes`), the maximum number of followers per user that each reducer should process to reduce skew (`maxNumNeighborsPerReducers`), and the output directory for the job (`simsHashJobOutputDirectory`).

For the `RightNodeCosineSimilarityScioBaseApp` job, the configuration settings include the number of similarities to calculate (`numSims`), the minimum cosine similarity threshold (`minCosineSimilarityThreshold`), the maximum out-degree for each node (`maxOutDegree`), and the output directory for the job (`cosineSimJobOutputDirectory`).

These configuration settings are used to control the behavior of the two jobs, which are responsible for calculating similarity scores between nodes in a multi-type graph. The `RightNodeSimHashScioBaseApp` job uses SimHash, a locality-sensitive hashing algorithm, to generate sketches for each node in the graph. These sketches are then used to calculate similarity scores between nodes based on their Jaccard similarity. The `RightNodeCosineSimilarityScioBaseApp` job uses cosine similarity to calculate similarity scores between nodes based on their feature vectors.

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project that aims to provide similarity scores between nodes in a multi-type graph. The configuration settings defined in this code allow for customization of the similarity calculation process to fit the specific needs of the project. For example, the `numHashes` setting can be adjusted to trade off between accuracy and computational efficiency, while the `maxNumNeighborsPerReducers` setting can be adjusted to balance workload across reducers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines configuration settings for two different jobs related to simulating similarity between nodes in a multi-type graph.

2. What is the significance of the values assigned to `numHashes` and `maxNumNeighborsPerReducers`?
- `numHashes` determines the number of hashes generated in a sketch, which affects the size of the uncompressed sketch per user. `maxNumNeighborsPerReducers` limits the number of followers per user that each reducer processes, reducing skew.

3. What are the output directories for the two different jobs?
- The output directory for the `RightNodeSimHashScioBaseApp` job is "right_node/sims/sim_hash", while the output directory for the `RightNodeCosineSimilarityScioBaseApp` job is "right_node/sims/cosine_similarity".
