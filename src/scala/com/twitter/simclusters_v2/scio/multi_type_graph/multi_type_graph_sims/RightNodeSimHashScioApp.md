This code defines two Scala objects, `RightNodeSimHashScioAdhocApp` and `RightNodeSimHashScioBatchApp`, which are used to run a batch or adhoc job for computing right node similarity hashes for a multi-type graph. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to generate similarity hashes for nodes in a graph, which can be used for various graph-based machine learning tasks such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems.

The code imports several libraries, including `SnapshotDALDataset` and `RightNodeSimHashScioScalaDataset`, which are used to read and write data to and from HDFS. The `RightNodeSimHashScioScalaDataset` is used to read the input data, which is a multi-type graph, and compute the similarity hashes for each node in the graph. The resulting hashes are then written to HDFS using the `SnapshotDALDataset` library.

The `RightNodeSimHashScioAdhocApp` and `RightNodeSimHashScioBatchApp` objects are used to run the similarity hash computation job in either adhoc or batch mode. The `isAdhoc` flag is used to determine whether the job is being run in adhoc or batch mode. If `isAdhoc` is set to `true`, the job is run in adhoc mode, and if it is set to `false`, the job is run in batch mode. The `rightNodeSimHashSnapshotDataset` variable is used to specify the input data source for the job, which is either the adhoc or batch dataset depending on the mode.

To run the job, the user can either build the job using Bazel and run it using the `bin/d6w create` command for adhoc mode or the `bin/d6w schedule` command for batch mode. The user can specify various parameters such as the project name, user name, date, and machine type using the `--bind` flag.

Example usage:

```scala
// Run the job in adhoc mode
RightNodeSimHashScioAdhocApp.run()

// Run the job in batch mode
RightNodeSimHashScioBatchApp.run()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and appears to be related to simhashing for multi-type graphs. It includes two objects, `RightNodeSimHashScioAdhocApp` and `RightNodeSimHashScioBatchApp`, which seem to be used for adhoc and batch runs respectively.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several dependencies from other packages, including `SnapshotDALDataset` from `com.twitter.dal.client.dataset`, `RightNodeSimHashScioScalaDataset` from `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.hdfs_sources`, and `RightNodeSimHashSketch` from `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala`.

3. How can this code be built and deployed?
- The code can be built using `bazel bundle` and deployed using `bin/d6w create` for adhoc runs and `bin/d6w schedule` for batch runs. The commands include several arguments that need to be bound, such as the project name, user name, date, and machine.
