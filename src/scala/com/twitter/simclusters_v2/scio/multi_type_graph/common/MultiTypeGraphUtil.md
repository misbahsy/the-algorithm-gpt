The `MultiTypeGraphUtil` object provides utility functions for working with a multi-type graph. The purpose of this code is to define an ordering for the different types of nodes and edges in the graph, and to provide a function for reading a truncated version of the graph from a data source.

The `nounOrdering` value defines an ordering for the different types of nodes in the graph. The ordering is based on the order in which the different types are defined in the `simclusters_v2/multi_type_graph.thrift` file. The `rightNodeTypeOrdering` value defines an ordering for the different types of edges in the graph. The `rightNodeOrdering` value defines an ordering for the combination of edge type and node type.

The `getTruncatedMultiTypeGraph` function reads a truncated version of the multi-type graph from a data source. The function takes an optional parameter `noOlderThan` which specifies the maximum age of the snapshot to read. The function returns an `SCollection` of tuples, where each tuple contains a user ID, a right node, and an edge weight. The right node is a node that is connected to the user by an edge, and the edge weight is a measure of the strength of the connection.

This code is likely used in the larger project to provide a way to read a truncated version of the multi-type graph from a data source. The ordering functions may be used to sort nodes and edges in the graph for display or analysis purposes. The `getTruncatedMultiTypeGraph` function may be used to extract a subset of the graph for further analysis or processing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines utility functions for working with a multi-type graph in the context of the Twitter Algorithm project.

2. What is the significance of the `RootMHPath`, `RootThriftPath`, and `AdhocRootPath` variables?
- These variables define the root paths for different types of data sources used in the project, such as Manhattan sequence files and Thrift files.

3. What is the `getTruncatedMultiTypeGraph` function doing?
- This function retrieves a truncated version of a multi-type graph from a data source, filtering out nodes that are older than a specified duration. It returns an SCollection of tuples representing edges in the graph, where each tuple contains a user ID, a right node, and an edge weight.
