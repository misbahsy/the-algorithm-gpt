[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/src/scala/com/twitter/simclusters_v2/scio/multi_type_graph/assemble_multi_type_graph/Config.scala)

The code defines a Scala object called `Config` that contains various constants used in assembling a multi-type graph for the Twitter platform. The purpose of the multi-type graph is to represent relationships between different types of entities on the platform, such as users, tweets, and topics. The constants defined in `Config` are used to specify file paths, output directories, and other parameters that are used in the graph assembly process.

For example, `RootMHPath` and `RootThriftPath` specify the root directories for the Manhattan sequence files and Thrift files that contain the data used to build the graph. `truncatedMultiTypeGraphMHOutputDir` and `truncatedMultiTypeGraphThriftOutputDir` specify the output directories for truncated versions of the graph in Manhattan and Thrift formats, respectively. `TopKConfig` is a map that specifies the number of top entities to include for each engagement type in the graph.

The constants in `Config` are used throughout the multi-type graph assembly process to ensure consistency and facilitate customization. For example, the `TopKConfig` map is used to determine the number of top entities to include for each engagement type, which can be adjusted depending on the specific needs of the project. Similarly, the `SampledEmployeeIds` set can be used to specify a subset of employee IDs to include in the graph for testing or other purposes.

Overall, the `Config` object plays an important role in the multi-type graph assembly process by providing a centralized location for specifying key parameters and ensuring consistency across different parts of the codebase. By adjusting the constants in `Config`, developers can customize the graph assembly process to meet the specific needs of their project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a Scala object called `Config` that contains various string and integer constants used in assembling a multi-type graph for Twitter data.

2. What is the significance of the `TopKConfig` map?
- The `TopKConfig` map specifies the top K most frequent nouns for each engagement type in the multi-type graph. This information is used to weight the edges between nodes in the graph.

3. What is the purpose of the `SampledEmployeeIds` set?
- The `SampledEmployeeIds` set is currently empty, but it may be used to specify a set of employee IDs to sample from when testing or debugging the multi-type graph assembly process.
