This code defines two Scala objects, `AssembleMultiTypeGraphScioAdhocApp` and `AssembleMultiTypeGraphScioBatchApp`, which are used to run and deploy a Scio job for assembling a multi-type graph. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to build and deploy the Scio job for assembling a multi-type graph, which is a key component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The `AssembleMultiTypeGraphScioAdhocApp` object is used to kick off an adhoc run of the Scio job, while the `AssembleMultiTypeGraphScioBatchApp` object is used to deploy the job. Both objects extend the `AssembleMultiTypeGraphScioBaseApp` trait, which provides common functionality for the two objects.

The `isAdhoc` field in both objects is used to determine whether the job is being run adhoc or deployed as a batch job. The `rootMHPath` and `rootThriftPath` fields are used to specify the root paths for the multi-hop and Thrift data, respectively. These paths are set differently depending on whether the job is being run adhoc or deployed as a batch job.

The code also includes comments that provide instructions for building, running, and deploying the Scio job using the `bazel` and `d6w` tools. These instructions include specifying various configuration options such as the GCP project name, user name, date, and machine type.

Overall, this code provides a way to build and deploy the Scio job for assembling a multi-type graph, which is a key component of The Algorithm from Twitter project. By providing clear instructions and configuration options, this code makes it easy to run and deploy the job in different environments.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and contains two objects that extend a base app. One object is for adhoc runs and the other is for batch runs. The purpose of the code is to assemble a multi-type graph using Scio.
2. What are the dependencies required to run this code?
   - It is not clear from the code what dependencies are required to run it. However, based on the comments, it seems that the code requires Bazel and D6W to build and run the app respectively.
3. What is the configuration required to run this code?
   - The code requires configuration parameters such as the GCP project name, user name, date, and machine. These parameters are passed as arguments to the D6W command when running the app. It is not clear from the code what other configuration parameters are required.
