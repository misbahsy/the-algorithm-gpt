This code is part of a larger project that generates tweet recommendations for users based on their interests and preferences. The main purpose of this code is to create a series of Scio jobs that read consumer embeddings, generate tweet embeddings, and produce tweet recommendations using Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms. The recommendations are then saved to BigQuery tables and KeyValSnapshotDatasets for further analysis and usage.

The `TweetsANNJob` trait serves as the base for various Scio jobs with different configurations. It defines common configurations, such as `projectId`, `environment`, and methods like `configurePipeline` that sets up the pipeline for reading consumer embeddings, generating tweet embeddings, and producing tweet recommendations.

Several Scio jobs are defined, each with different configurations for generating tweet recommendations:

1. `IIKF2020TweetsANNBQAdhocJob`: Ad-hoc job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset.
2. `IIKF2020Hl8El50TweetsANNBQAdhocJob`: Ad-hoc job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset with half-life of 8 hours and embedding length of 50.
3. `MTSConsumerEmbeddingsTweetsANNBQAdhocJob`: Ad-hoc job for tweet recommendations from MTS Consumer Embeddings dataset.
4. `IIKF2020TweetsANNBQBatchJob`: Batch job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset.
5. `IIKF2020Hl0El15TweetsANNBQBatchJob`: Batch job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset with no decay and embedding length of 15.
6. `IIKF2020Hl2El15TweetsANNBQBatchJob`: Batch job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset with half-life of 2 hours and embedding length of 15.
7. `IIKF2020Hl2El50TweetsANNBQBatchJob`: Batch job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset with half-life of 2 hours and embedding length of 50.
8. `IIKF2020Hl8El50TweetsANNBQBatchJob`: Batch job for tweet recommendations from Interested In 2020 dataset with half-life of 8 hours and embedding length of 50.
9. `MTSConsumerEmbeddingsTweetsANNBQBatchJob`: Batch job for tweet recommendations from MTS Consumer Embeddings dataset.

Each job reads consumer embeddings using SQL functions like `getInterestedIn2020SQL` and `getMTSConsumerEmbeddingsFav90P20MSQL`. The recommendations are saved to BigQuery tables using the `BigQueryIO` writer and to KeyValSnapshotDatasets using the `DAL.writeVersionedKeyVal` method.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `TweetsANNJob` trait and how is it used in the different Scio jobs defined in this file?
   **Answer:** The `TweetsANNJob` trait defines a common structure and functionality for generating tweet recommendations using different configurations and input data. It is extended by various Scio jobs in this file, each with their own specific configurations and settings, such as ad-hoc or batch runs, different consumer embeddings, and output tables.

2. **Question:** How are the different Scio jobs scheduled and what are the differences between ad-hoc and batch jobs in this code?
   **Answer:** The scheduling of Scio jobs is not explicitly defined in this code, but it is mentioned in some comments that the schedule command needs to be run only if there is any change in the config. Ad-hoc jobs are meant for one-time runs or testing purposes, while batch jobs are meant for regular, scheduled runs in a production environment.

3. **Question:** What are the different types of consumer embeddings used in this code and how are they fetched using SQL functions?
   **Answer:** There are two types of consumer embeddings used in this code: Interested In 2020 (IIKF 2020) and MTS Consumer Embeddings. They are fetched using SQL functions `getInterestedIn2020SQL` and `getMTSConsumerEmbeddingsFav90P20MSQL`, respectively. These functions take a DateTime and an integer as input and return a SQL query string to fetch the corresponding consumer embeddings.
