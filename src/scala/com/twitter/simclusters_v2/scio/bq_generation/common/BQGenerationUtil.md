The `BQGenerationUtil` object provides utility functions for generating SQL queries to read data from BigQuery tables. The object contains several functions that generate SQL queries for different purposes, such as retrieving user and tweet engagement events, retrieving tweets and their favorite counts, and filtering tweets based on media type or NSFW status. 

One of the main functions is `getInterestedIn2020SQL`, which generates a SQL query to read user embeddings from a specific BigQuery table. The function takes a query date and a look-back period as input and returns a SQL query that retrieves user embeddings from the specified table for the given time period. The retrieved embeddings are filtered based on a minimum score threshold. 

Another important function is `getMTSConsumerEmbeddingsFav90P20MSQL`, which generates a SQL query to read consumer embeddings from a specific BigQuery table. The function takes a query date and a look-back period as input and returns a SQL query that retrieves consumer embeddings from the specified table for the given time period. The retrieved embeddings are filtered based on a minimum score threshold. 

The object also contains functions for retrieving tweet engagement events, retrieving tweets and their favorite counts, and filtering tweets based on media type or NSFW status. These functions generate SQL queries that read data from different BigQuery tables and return the results in a specific format. 

Overall, the `BQGenerationUtil` object provides a set of utility functions for generating SQL queries to read data from BigQuery tables. These functions are used in the larger project to retrieve and process data for various purposes, such as generating recommendations for users based on their interests and engagement history. 

Example usage:

```
val queryDate = DateTime.now()
val lookBackDays = 7
val sql = BQGenerationUtil.getInterestedIn2020SQL(queryDate, lookBackDays)
// Execute the SQL query using a BigQuery client library
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides utility functions for generating SQL queries to retrieve data from specific BigQuery tables related to Twitter's SimClusters_v2 project. It solves the problem of having to manually write SQL queries to retrieve data from these tables.

2. What are the input parameters for each of the utility functions?
- The input parameters vary depending on the function, but generally include a start and end time for the time window of interest, as well as any additional filters or template variables needed for the specific SQL query being generated.

3. What is the structure of the output SQL queries generated by these utility functions?
- The output SQL queries are in string format and include a combination of hardcoded SQL paths, table details, and template variables that are filled in based on the input parameters. The queries generally include SELECT statements with specific column names and table joins, as well as WHERE clauses with various filters based on the input parameters.
