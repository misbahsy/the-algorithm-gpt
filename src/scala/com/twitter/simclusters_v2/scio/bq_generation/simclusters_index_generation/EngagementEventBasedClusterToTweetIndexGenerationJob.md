This code is responsible for generating various types of SimClusters cluster-to-tweet indices based on different engagement events such as favorites, retweets, replies, video views, and ad engagements. These indices are used to recommend relevant tweets to users based on their interests and engagement patterns.

The code defines several jobs for generating indices, each extending the `EngagementEventBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationJob` trait. These jobs include `FavBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationAdhocJob`, `VideoViewBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationAdhocJob`, `RetweetBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationAdhocJob`, and others. Each job has its own specific configurations, such as the contributing action types, undo action types, and output table details.

The main method `configurePipeline` reads consumer embeddings SQL, generates the SimClusters cluster-to-tweet index using the `getTopKTweetsForClusterKeyBQ` method, and saves the index to a BigQuery table and a KeyValSnapshotDataset. The BigQuery table is configured with time partitioning and ingestion time.

For example, the `FavBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationAdhocJob` job generates a SimClusters index based on favorite events. It uses the `getInterestedIn2020SQL` function to get consumer embeddings and sets the contributing action types to `ActionType.ServerTweetFav.name`. The output table is set to "simclusters_fav_based_cluster_to_tweet_index".

The code also provides utility methods for converting action types to strings and building SQL queries for user tweet engagement events.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**

   This code is for generating SimClusters cluster-to-tweet index using different engagement events (e.g., favorites, retweets, video views, etc.) from Twitter data. The generated index is saved to a BigQuery table and as a KeyValSnapshotDataset.

2. **How are the different engagement events handled in this code?**

   The code defines different jobs for each engagement event type (e.g., FavBased, VideoViewBased, RetweetBased, etc.) by extending the `EngagementEventBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationJob` trait. Each job specifies its own configurations, such as contributing action types, undo action types, and output table details.

3. **How can I configure the code to run for a specific engagement event type?**

   To run the code for a specific engagement event type, you need to use the corresponding job object (e.g., `FavBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationAdhocJob`, `VideoViewBasedClusterToTweetIndexGenerationAdhocJob`, etc.). Each job object has its own configurations and output settings, which can be further customized if needed.
