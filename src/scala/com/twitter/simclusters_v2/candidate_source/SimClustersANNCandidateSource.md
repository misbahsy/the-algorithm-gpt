This code defines a class `SimClustersANNCandidateSource` that retrieves tweet candidates with high similarity to a given source tweet. The core algorithm used is approximate cosine similarity. The process consists of the following steps:

1. Retrieve the SimClusters Embedding by the SimClustersEmbeddingId.
2. Fetch top N clusters' top tweets from the clusterTweetCandidatesStore (TopTweetsPerCluster index).
3. Calculate all the tweet candidates' dot-product or approximate cosine similarity to source tweets.
4. Take top M tweet candidates by the step 3's score.
5. Calculate the similarity score between source and candidates.
6. Return top N candidates by the step 5's score.

The class takes several parameters, such as `clusterTweetCandidatesStore`, `simClustersEmbeddingStore`, `heavyRanker`, and `configs`. It also has a method `get` that takes a query and returns a `Future[Option[Seq[SimClustersTweetCandidate]]]`. The query contains the source embedding ID and an optional override configuration.

The `fetchCandidates` method retrieves the candidates based on the source embedding and configuration. It filters out candidates based on their age and calculates their scores. The `reranking` method re-ranks the candidates based on their similarity scores and returns the top N candidates.

The `SimClustersANNCandidateSource` object contains several default configurations for different embedding types, such as `DefaultConfigMappings` and `LookbackMediaTweetConfig`. These configurations can be used to customize the behavior of the candidate source.

Overall, this code is used to find tweet candidates that are similar to a given source tweet, which can be useful in various applications like recommendation systems or content discovery.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SimClustersANNCandidateSource` class and how does it work?
   
   **Answer**: The `SimClustersANNCandidateSource` class is responsible for finding tweets whose similarity is close to a given source `SimClustersEmbeddingId`. It uses approximate cosine similarity as the core algorithm and follows a series of steps to fetch, rank, and rerank tweet candidates based on their similarity scores to the source tweet.

2. **Question**: How are the configurations for each `EmbeddingType` defined and used in the `SimClustersANNCandidateSource`?

   **Answer**: The configurations for each `EmbeddingType` are defined in the `SimClustersANNConfig` case class and its companion object. These configurations are used to customize the behavior of the `SimClustersANNCandidateSource` for different embedding types, such as setting the maximum number of results, candidate age, and ranking algorithm.

3. **Question**: What is the role of the `HeavyRanker` in the `SimClustersANNCandidateSource` class?

   **Answer**: The `HeavyRanker` is used for reranking the tweet candidates based on their similarity scores to the source tweet. It is an optional step controlled by the `enableHeavyRanking` configuration flag. If enabled, the `HeavyRanker` will be used to rank the candidates using the specified ranking algorithm before returning the top N candidates.
