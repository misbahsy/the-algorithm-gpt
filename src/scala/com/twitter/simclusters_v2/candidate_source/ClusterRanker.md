The `ClusterRanker` object in the `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.candidate_source` package provides a set of ranking schemes for clusters of users based on their scores. The object extends the `Enumeration` class and defines five ranking schemes as values of the `ClusterRanker` type. These ranking schemes are `RankByNormalizedFavScore`, `RankByFavScore`, `RankByFollowScore`, `RankByLogFavScore`, and `RankByNormalizedLogFavScore`.

The `getTopKClustersByScore` method takes a map of clusters with their scores, a ranking scheme, and a value `topK` that specifies the number of top-scoring clusters to return. The method returns a map of the top `topK` clusters with their scores. The method first maps the input map of clusters to a new map of clusters with their scores transformed according to the specified ranking scheme. The transformed scores are then sorted in ascending order, and the top `topK` clusters are selected. Finally, the method maps the selected clusters to a new map with their scores adjusted to a minimum value of `1e-4`.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves clustering Twitter users based on their interests. The `UserToInterestedInClusterScores` class is likely used to store the scores of users in each cluster. The `ClusterRanker` object provides a set of ranking schemes that can be used to sort the clusters based on their scores. The `getTopKClustersByScore` method can be used to select the top-scoring clusters according to a specified ranking scheme. This functionality can be useful in various applications, such as recommending users to follow or targeting ads to users based on their interests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ClusterRanker` object?
- The `ClusterRanker` object is an enumeration that defines different ranking schemes for clusters based on their scores.

2. What is the input and output of the `getTopKClustersByScore` method?
- The input is a map of clusters with their scores, a ranking scheme, and an integer `topK` that specifies the number of top scoring clusters to return. The output is a map of the top `topK` clusters with their scores.

3. How are the clusters sorted and filtered in the `getTopKClustersByScore` method?
- The clusters are sorted in ascending order based on their scores according to the specified ranking scheme. The top `topK` clusters are then selected and their scores are mapped to a new map, where the minimum score is set to `1e-4`.
