The `EntityEmbeddingsSources` object contains methods and constants related to retrieving and filtering entity embeddings from various datasets. These embeddings are used in the larger project to represent entities (such as hashtags and semantic core entities) in a vector space, allowing for similarity calculations and clustering.

The object contains constants for various datasets, each representing a different type of entity embedding. For example, `SemanticCoreSimClustersEmbeddingsDec11Dataset` represents embeddings for semantic core entities from December 2011. These constants are used in the methods to retrieve the appropriate dataset based on the desired model version.

The `getSemanticCoreEntityEmbeddingsSource` method takes an embedding type, model version, and date range as input, and returns a `TypedPipe` of `(Long, SimClustersEmbedding)` tuples representing the entity ID and corresponding embedding. The method retrieves the appropriate dataset based on the input parameters and filters the embeddings by the specified type.

Similarly, the `getReverseIndexedSemanticCoreEntityEmbeddingsSource` method returns a `TypedPipe` of `(ClusterId, Seq[SemanticCoreEntityWithScore])` tuples representing the cluster ID and the entities within that cluster, along with their scores. This method retrieves the appropriate dataset and filters the embeddings by type.

The object also contains methods for retrieving the raw DAL dataset references for entity embeddings, which can be used for writing to DAL.

Overall, this object provides a convenient interface for retrieving and filtering entity embeddings from various datasets, which are used in the larger project for similarity calculations and clustering.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides access to various datasets containing embeddings for different types of entities (e.g. hashtags, semantic core entities) and different embedding types (e.g. fav-based, follow-based). It allows developers to retrieve these embeddings for a given date range and model version.

2. What are the valid embedding types for the Semantic Core entity datasets?
- The valid embedding types for the Semantic Core entity datasets are FavBasedSematicCoreEntity and FollowBasedSematicCoreEntity.

3. What is the difference between the FavTfgTopicEmbeddingsDataset and the FavInferredLanguageTfgTopicEmbeddingsDataset?
- The FavTfgTopicEmbeddingsDataset is built from user device languages, while the FavInferredLanguageTfgTopicEmbeddingsDataset is built from inferred user consumed languages. Both are keyed by SimClustersEmbeddingId with different InternalId types.
