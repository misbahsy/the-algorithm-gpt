The code above defines two KeyValInjection objects for serializing and deserializing data in the SimClustersInferredEntities format. The SimClustersInferredEntities format is a Thrift-serialized format used to represent inferred entities in the SimClusters algorithm. 

The first KeyValInjection object, InferredEntityInjection, takes a Long key and a SimClustersInferredEntities value and serializes them using the BigEndian encoding for the Long key and the ScalaCompactThrift serialization for the SimClustersInferredEntities value. This object can be used to write inferred entities to a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) in a format that can be read by other parts of the SimClusters algorithm.

The second KeyValInjection object, InferredEntityKeyedByClusterInjection, takes an Int key and a SimClustersInferredEntities value and serializes them using the BigEndian encoding for the Int key and the ScalaCompactThrift serialization for the SimClustersInferredEntities value. This object can be used to write inferred entities to a HDFS in a format that is keyed by cluster ID. 

Both KeyValInjection objects are defined in the InferredEntitiesInjections object, which is located in the com.twitter.simclusters_v2.hdfs_sources.injections package. These objects can be imported and used in other parts of the SimClusters algorithm to read and write inferred entities to and from HDFS. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.simclusters_v2.hdfs_sources.injections.InferredEntitiesInjections.InferredEntityInjection

val inferredEntities: SimClustersInferredEntities = // some inferred entities
val key: Long = // some Long key

// Serialize inferred entities and key using InferredEntityInjection
val serialized: Array[Byte] = InferredEntityInjection.apply(key, inferredEntities)

// Deserialize inferred entities and key using InferredEntityInjection
val (deserializedKey, deserializedEntities) = InferredEntityInjection.extract(serialized)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines two KeyValInjection objects for converting between Long/Int keys and SimClustersInferredEntities objects. It is likely used for serialization and deserialization of data in the project's Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) sources.

2. What is the significance of the SimClustersInferredEntities class?
- SimClustersInferredEntities is likely a data class used in the project to represent inferred entities in a similarity clustering algorithm. It is used as the value type in the KeyValInjection objects defined in this code.

3. Are there any other dependencies or imports required for this code to function properly?
- Yes, this code relies on imports from the com.twitter.scalding_internal.multiformat.format.keyval package and the com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala package. It is possible that other dependencies are required elsewhere in the project.
