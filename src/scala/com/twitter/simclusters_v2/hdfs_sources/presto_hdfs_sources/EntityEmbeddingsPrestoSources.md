This code defines two constants, `SemanticCorePerLanguageSimClustersEmbeddingsDataset` and `ReverseIndexSemanticCorePerLanguageSimClustersEmbeddingsDataset`, both of which are assigned values from other classes in the `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.hdfs_sources.presto_hdfs_sources` package. 

The purpose of these constants is to provide access to specific datasets containing entity embeddings for use in the larger project. Entity embeddings are a way of representing entities (such as words or phrases) as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar entities are represented by vectors that are closer together. These embeddings can be used in a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text classification or information retrieval.

The `SemanticCorePerLanguageSimClustersEmbeddingsDataset` constant provides access to a dataset containing entity embeddings for semantic cores (i.e. the most important words or phrases) in different languages, while the `ReverseIndexSemanticCorePerLanguageSimClustersEmbeddingsDataset` constant provides access to a dataset containing the same embeddings, but indexed by the entities themselves rather than the semantic cores.

These constants can be used throughout the larger project to access and manipulate the entity embeddings as needed. For example, a method in another class might use the `SemanticCorePerLanguageSimClustersEmbeddingsDataset` constant to retrieve the embeddings for a particular language and perform some operation on them. 

Overall, this code plays an important role in providing access to key data resources for the larger project, and helps to facilitate the use of entity embeddings in natural language processing tasks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines two final values for datasets related to semantic core and reverse index semantic core per language simclusters embeddings in Presto.

2. What is the significance of the "object" keyword at the beginning of the code?
   - The "object" keyword in Scala is used to define a singleton object, which is a class that can only have one instance and is used to encapsulate related functionality.

3. What other files or dependencies are required for this code to work properly?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet what other files or dependencies are required for this code to work properly.
