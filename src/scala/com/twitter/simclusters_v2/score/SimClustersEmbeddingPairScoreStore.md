The `SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreStore` object contains several methods for building different types of pair score stores based on similarity metrics between pairs of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects. These similarity metrics include dot product, cosine similarity, log-normalized cosine similarity, exponential scaled cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance. 

Each method takes in a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects and returns a `PairScoreStore` that can be used to compute scores between pairs of embeddings. The `PairScoreStore` is a trait that defines methods for retrieving the underlying stores of embeddings and computing scores between pairs of embeddings. 

The `SimClustersEmbeddingInternalPairScoreStore` case class is an implementation of the `PairScoreStore` trait that takes in a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects and a function for computing scores between pairs of embeddings. This implementation defines methods for retrieving the underlying stores of embeddings and computing scores between pairs of embeddings using the provided function. 

For example, the `buildCosineSimilarityStore` method takes in a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects and returns a `PairScoreStore` that computes cosine similarity scores between pairs of embeddings. The implementation of the `cosineSimilarity` function is provided as an argument to the `SimClustersEmbeddingInternalPairScoreStore` constructor. 

Overall, this code provides a flexible way to compute similarity scores between pairs of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects using different similarity metrics. It can be used as a building block for larger projects that require similarity-based computations. 

Example usage:

```
val embeddingStore: ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding] = ...
val cosineSimilarityStore = SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreStore.buildCosineSimilarityStore(embeddingStore)
val embedding1: SimClustersEmbedding = ...
val embedding2: SimClustersEmbedding = ...
val scoreId = SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId(embedding1.id, embedding2.id)
val scoreFuture: Future[Option[Double]] = cosineSimilarityStore.getScore(scoreId)
```
