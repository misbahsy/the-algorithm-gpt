The `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreStore` is a Scala class that provides a generic store wrapper to aggregate the scores of N underlying stores in a weighted fashion. It is used to combine the scores from multiple sources into a single score. The class takes a sequence of `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreParameter` objects as input, which define the parameters for each underlying score. The `get` method of the class takes a `ThriftScoreId` object as input and returns a `Future` that resolves to an optional `ThriftScore` object.

The `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreParameter` case class defines the parameters for each underlying score. It takes the following parameters:
- `scoreAlgorithm`: the name of the underlying score algorithm.
- `weight`: the contribution to the weighted sum of this sub-score.
- `idTransform`: a function that transforms the source `ScoreInternalId` to the underlying score `InternalId`.
- `scoreTransform`: a function to apply to the sub-score before adding it to the weighted sum.

The `SameTypeScoreInternalIdTransform` and `identityScoreTransform` functions are provided as defaults for the `idTransform` and `scoreTransform` parameters, respectively.

The `genericPairScoreIdToSimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId` function is used to convert a `GenericPairScoreId` object to a `SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId` object. It takes the following parameters:
- `embeddingType1`: the type of the first embedding.
- `embeddingType2`: the type of the second embedding.
- `modelVersion`: the version of the model.

The `simClustersEmbeddingPairScoreIdToGenericPairScoreId` function is used to convert a `SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId` object to a `GenericPairScoreId` object.

The `get` method of the `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreStore` class retrieves the scores from each underlying store using the `scoreFacadeStore` object. It then applies the `scoreTransform` function to each sub-score and multiplies it by the `weight` parameter. The resulting scores are then summed and returned as a `ThriftScore` object. If all of the underlying scores are `None`, then `None` is returned.

Overall, the `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreStore` class is a useful tool for aggregating scores from multiple sources into a single score. It provides a flexible and extensible way to combine scores from different algorithms and models.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a generic store wrapper that aggregates the scores of N underlying stores in a weighted fashion. It is part of the scoring module of the SimClusters_v2 project from Twitter.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `get` method?
- The `get` method takes a `ThriftScoreId` as input and returns a `Future` that resolves to an optional `ThriftScore`. The `ThriftScoreId` is transformed using the `idTransform` function specified in the `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreParameter` for each underlying store, and the resulting scores are aggregated using the weights specified in the same parameters.

3. What are some examples of the `idTransform` and `scoreTransform` functions that can be used in the `WeightedSumAggregatedScoreParameter`?
- The `idTransform` function can be used to transform the `ScoreInternalId` of the input `ThriftScoreId` to the `ScoreInternalId` used by the underlying store. For example, the `genericPairScoreIdToSimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId` function converts a `GenericPairScoreId` to a `SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId`. The `scoreTransform` function can be used to apply a transformation to the score returned by the underlying store before it is added to the weighted sum. The default transformation is the identity function.
