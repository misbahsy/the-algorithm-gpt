The code defines two traits: `ScoreStore` and `PairScoreStore`. These traits are used to define a readable store for scores and a pairwise score store respectively. 

The `ScoreStore` trait extends the `ReadableStore` trait and requires a `ScoreId` as the key and a `Score` as the value. It also requires an algorithm type to be included. The `fromThriftScoreId` method is used to convert a `ThriftScoreId` to a `ScoreId`. The `toThriftStore` method is used to convert the `ScoreStore` to a `ReadableStore` with `ThriftScoreId` as the key and `ThriftScore` as the value.

The `PairScoreStore` trait extends the `ScoreStore` trait and requires a `PairScoreId` as the key. It also requires two composite keys, `compositeKey1` and `compositeKey2`, which are used to hydrate the left and right side features respectively. The `underlyingStore1` and `underlyingStore2` methods are used to hydrate the left and right side features respectively. The `score` method is used to calculate the score for a given pair of left and right side features. The `get` method is used to get the score for a given `PairScoreId`. The `multiGet` method is used to get the scores for multiple `PairScoreId`s.

These traits are used to define a readable store for scores and a pairwise score store respectively. The `ScoreStore` trait can be used to define a readable store for scores, while the `PairScoreStore` trait can be used to define a pairwise score store. These traits can be used in the larger project to store and retrieve scores and pairwise scores. For example, the `ScoreStore` trait can be used to store and retrieve scores for a given algorithm type, while the `PairScoreStore` trait can be used to store and retrieve pairwise scores for a given algorithm type and left and right side features. 

Example usage of `ScoreStore`:
```scala
class MyScoreStore extends ScoreStore[MyScoreId] {
  override def fromThriftScoreId: ThriftScoreId => MyScoreId = ???
  override def get(k: MyScoreId): Future[Option[Score]] = ???
}
```

Example usage of `PairScoreStore`:
```scala
class MyPairScoreStore extends PairScoreStore[MyPairScoreId, MyCompositeKey1, MyCompositeKey2, MyValue1, MyValue2] {
  override def compositeKey1: MyPairScoreId => MyCompositeKey1 = ???
  override def compositeKey2: MyPairScoreId => MyCompositeKey2 = ???
  override def underlyingStore1: ReadableStore[MyCompositeKey1, MyValue1] = ???
  override def underlyingStore2: ReadableStore[MyCompositeKey2, MyValue2] = ???
  override def score: (MyValue1, MyValue2) => Future[Option[Double]] = ???
  override def fromThriftScoreId: ThriftScoreId => MyPairScoreId = ???
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScoreStore` trait and how is it used in the application?
- The `ScoreStore` trait is a `ReadableStore` with `ScoreId` as the key and `Score` as the value, and it needs to include the algorithm type. It is used as a base trait for other score stores in the application.

2. What is the purpose of the `PairScoreStore` trait and how is it different from the `ScoreStore` trait?
- The `PairScoreStore` trait is a generic pairwise score store that requires both left and right side feature hydration. It extends the `ScoreStore` trait and adds methods for left and right side feature hydration, as well as a `score` method that takes two values and returns a `Future` of an optional `Double` score.

3. What is the purpose of the `toThriftStore` method in the `ScoreStore` trait?
- The `toThriftStore` method converts the `ScoreStore` to a `ReadableStore` with `ThriftScoreId` as the key and `ThriftScore` as the value. It does this by mapping the keys using the `fromThriftScoreId` method and converting the values to their Thrift versions.
