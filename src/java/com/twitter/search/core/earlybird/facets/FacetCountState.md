The `FacetCountState` class is a utility class that maintains the internal state during one facet count request. It is used to keep track of the fields to be counted, the number of results requested, and the results found. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to add a facet to be counted in a request, and to check whether or not there is a field to be counted for which no skip list is stored.

The `FacetCountState` class has a constructor that takes a `Schema` object and an integer `minNumFacetResults`. The `Schema` object is used to get the facet field by facet name, and the `minNumFacetResults` is used to set the minimum number of facet results to be returned.

The `addFacet` method is used to add a facet to be counted in this request. It takes a `facetName` string and an integer `numResultsRequested`. The `facetfieldResults` map is used to store the facet field results, and the `fieldsToCount` set is used to store the fields to be counted.

The `hasFieldToCountWithoutSkipList` method is used to check whether or not there is a field to be counted for which no skip list is stored. It iterates over the `fieldsToCount` set and checks whether or not the field type is set to store the facet skip list.

The `getFacetFieldsToCountWithSkipLists` method is used to get the facet fields to count with skip lists. It uses the `Sets.filter` method from the Google Guava library to filter the `fieldsToCount` set based on whether or not the field type is set to store the facet skip list.

The `isCountField` method is used to check whether or not a given field is a count field. It takes a `Schema.FieldInfo` object and checks whether or not it is contained in the `fieldsToCount` set.

The `getFacetFieldResultsIterator` method is used to get an iterator over the facet field results. It returns an iterator over the values of the `facetfieldResults` map.

The `FacetFieldResults` class is a nested class that is used to store the facet field results. It has a constructor that takes a `facetName` string and an integer `numResultsRequested`. It also has a `results` field that is used to store the results found, a `numResultsFound` field that is used to store the number of results found, and a `finished` field that is used to indicate whether or not the facet field results are finished. The `isFinished` method is used to check whether or not the facet field results are finished. It returns true if the `finished` field is true or if the `results` field is not null and the `numResultsFound` field is greater than or equal to the `numResultsRequested` field.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a class called `FacetCountState` that maintains internal state during one facet count request. It is used to add facets to be counted, get information about the fields to count, and get facet field results. The purpose of this code is to provide functionality for counting facets in a search application.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the `com.google.common.collect.Sets` library for filtering a set of facet fields to count with skip lists.

3. What is the significance of the `minNumFacetResults` parameter in the constructor?
- The `minNumFacetResults` parameter is used to set the minimum number of facet results to be returned for a given facet. If the number of results requested for a facet is less than this minimum, the minimum is used instead. This ensures that a minimum number of results are always returned for each facet.
