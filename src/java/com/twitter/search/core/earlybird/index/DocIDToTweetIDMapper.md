The `DocIDToTweetIDMapper` interface provides a way to map document IDs in an index to corresponding tweet IDs. This interface defines several methods that can be used to retrieve tweet IDs, document IDs, and other information related to the mapping.

The `getTweetID` method takes a document ID as input and returns the corresponding tweet ID. The `getDocID` method takes a tweet ID as input and returns the corresponding document ID. If the tweet ID cannot be found in the index, the method returns `ID_NOT_FOUND`.

The `getNextDocID` and `getPreviousDocID` methods return the next and previous valid document IDs, respectively, given a current document ID. If no such document ID exists, `ID_NOT_FOUND` is returned.

The `getNumDocs` method returns the total number of documents stored in the mapper.

The `addMapping` method adds a mapping for a given tweet ID and returns the assigned document ID. If a document ID cannot be assigned to the tweet ID, the method returns `ID_NOT_FOUND`.

Finally, the `optimize` method converts the current `DocIDToTweetIDMapper` instance to an optimized instance with the same tweet IDs. This method should be called when an earlybird segment is being optimized, right before flushing it to disk.

Overall, this interface provides a way to map document IDs to tweet IDs and vice versa, which is useful for indexing and searching tweets. The methods defined in this interface can be used to retrieve tweet IDs, document IDs, and other information related to the mapping.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this interface?
- This interface is used for mapping the doc IDs in indexes to the corresponding tweet IDs.

2. What is the significance of the constant ID_NOT_FOUND?
- ID_NOT_FOUND is a constant indicating that a doc ID was not found in the mapper.

3. What is the purpose of the optimize() method?
- The optimize() method converts the current DocIDToTweetIDMapper to an optimized instance with the same tweet IDs, which should be called when an earlybird segment is being optimized, right before flushing it to disk.
