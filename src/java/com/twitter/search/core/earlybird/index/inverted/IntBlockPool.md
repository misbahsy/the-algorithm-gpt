The `IntBlockPool` class is a data structure used for storing and managing arrays of integers. It is modeled after the `TwitterCharBlockPool` class and is used in the larger project called "The Algorithm from Twitter". 

The purpose of this class is to provide a pool of blocks, where each block is an array of integers. The blocks are allocated as needed and can be accessed using an index. The class provides methods for adding, getting, and setting integers at specific indices. 

The `IntBlockPool` class is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment, so it uses synchronization to ensure thread safety. It also provides a `Flushable` interface, which allows it to be serialized and deserialized for storage or transmission. 

The `IntBlockPool` class has several important fields and methods. The `pool` field is an instance of the `Pool` class, which contains an array of integer arrays. The `currBlockIndex` field is an index into the `blocks` array, indicating the current block being used. The `currBlock` field is a reference to the current block being used. The `currBlockOffset` field is an index into the current block, indicating the next available position for adding an integer. 

The `add` method adds an integer to the current block and returns its overall index. If the current block is full, a new block is allocated. The `get` method retrieves an integer from the specified index. The `set` method sets an integer value at the specified index. The `length` method returns the number of integers in the pool. 

The `FlushHandler` class is an inner class that provides serialization and deserialization functionality for the `IntBlockPool` class. It writes the current block index, current block offset, and pool name to the output stream, along with the blocks array. It reads these values from the input stream and constructs a new `IntBlockPool` object. 

Overall, the `IntBlockPool` class provides a simple and efficient way to manage arrays of integers in a multi-threaded environment. It is used in the larger project to store and manipulate data for various algorithms.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the overall project?
- This code is an implementation of an integer block pool used for indexing in the Earlybird search engine. It is used to store and retrieve integer values efficiently.

2. What is the significance of the BLOCK_SHIFT and BLOCK_SIZE constants?
- BLOCK_SHIFT is used to determine the number of bits used to represent the block offset, while BLOCK_SIZE is the size of each block in the pool. These constants are used to calculate the index of a value in the pool.

3. What is the purpose of the FlushHandler class and how is it used?
- The FlushHandler class is used to serialize and deserialize the IntBlockPool object for storage and retrieval. It is used to write the current state of the pool to disk and read it back in when needed.
