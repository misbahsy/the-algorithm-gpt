The `DeletedDocs` class is a Lucene utility class that provides a way to delete documents from an index. It is an abstract class that provides an interface for deleting documents, getting a view of the deleted documents, and optimizing the deleted documents. The `DeletedDocs` class has two implementations: `Default` and `NO_DELETES`.

The `Default` implementation of `DeletedDocs` provides a way to delete documents and get a view of the deleted documents. It uses an `Int2IntOpenHashMap` to store the deleted documents, where the key is the document ID and the value is a unique, consecutively-increasing sequence ID. The `deleteDoc` method adds the document ID to the map if it doesn't already exist and returns true, otherwise it returns false. The `getView` method returns a `View` object that provides methods to check if a document is deleted, if there are any deleted documents, and to get a `Bits` object where all deleted documents have their bit set to 0 and all non-deleted documents have their bits set to 1. The `optimize` method returns a new `DeletedDocs` instance that has the same deleted tweet IDs, but mapped to the doc IDs in the `optimizedTweetIdMapper`.

The `NO_DELETES` implementation of `DeletedDocs` provides a way to get a view of the deleted documents when there are no deleted documents. It returns a `View` object that always returns false for `isDeleted`, false for `hasDeletions`, and null for `getLiveDocs`.

The `DeletedDocs` class is used in the larger project to delete documents from an index and to get a view of the deleted documents. It is used in conjunction with other Lucene utility classes to create and manage the index. Here is an example of how to use the `DeletedDocs` class to delete a document:

```
DeletedDocs deletedDocs = new DeletedDocs.Default(indexReader.maxDoc());
deletedDocs.deleteDoc(docID);
indexWriter.deleteDocuments(deletedDocs.getView().getLiveDocs());
```

In this example, `indexReader` is an instance of `IndexReader` and `indexWriter` is an instance of `IndexWriter`. The `DeletedDocs.Default` constructor is called with the maximum number of documents in the index. The `deleteDoc` method is called with the document ID to delete. The `getView` method is called to get a view of the deleted documents, and the `getLiveDocs` method is called to get a `Bits` object that is passed to the `deleteDocuments` method of the `IndexWriter`. This deletes the document from the index.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a part of the Earlybird search engine project from Twitter and specifically deals with indexing and deleting documents. It is used to create and manage a list of deleted documents.

2. What is the difference between the `Default` and `NO_DELETES` classes?
- The `Default` class is used to manage a list of deleted documents, while the `NO_DELETES` class is a placeholder for when there are no deleted documents. The `NO_DELETES` class returns null or false for all methods related to deleted documents.

3. What is the purpose of the `optimize` method and how is it used?
- The `optimize` method takes two `DocIDToTweetIDMapper` instances and returns a new `DeletedDocs` instance that has the same deleted tweet IDs, but mapped to the doc IDs in the `optimizedTweetIdMapper`. This is used to optimize the deleted document list for better performance.
