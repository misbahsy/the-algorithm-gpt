The `ColumnStrideFieldDocValues` class is a NumericDocValues implementation that uses an `AllDocsIterator` to iterate through all documents and gets its values from a `ColumnStrideFieldIndex` instance. This class is used to retrieve numeric values from a Lucene index.

The `ColumnStrideFieldIndex` instance is passed to the constructor of `ColumnStrideFieldDocValues` along with a `LeafReader` instance. The `AllDocsIterator` is created using the `LeafReader` instance. The `ColumnStrideFieldIndex` instance is used to retrieve the numeric value for the current document ID.

The `longValue()` method returns the numeric value for the current document ID. The `docID()` method returns the current document ID. The `nextDoc()` method moves the iterator to the next document and returns its document ID. The `advance(int target)` method moves the iterator to the document with the given document ID and returns its document ID. The `advanceExact(int target)` method moves the iterator to the document with the given document ID and returns true if the document ID exists and has a value, false otherwise. The `cost()` method returns the cost of iterating through all documents.

This class is used in the larger project to retrieve numeric values from a Lucene index. It is used in conjunction with other classes to perform search operations on the index. For example, a search query may use this class to retrieve the numeric values for a field and then use those values to perform a range query. 

Example usage:

```
ColumnStrideFieldIndex csf = new ColumnStrideFieldIndex("fieldName", values);
LeafReader reader = ... // create a LeafReader instance
ColumnStrideFieldDocValues docValues = new ColumnStrideFieldDocValues(csf, reader);
int docId = docValues.nextDoc();
while (docId != DocIdSetIterator.NO_MORE_DOCS) {
  long value = docValues.longValue();
  // do something with the value
  docId = docValues.nextDoc();
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a NumericDocValues implementation that uses an AllDocsIterator to iterate through all docs and gets its values from a ColumnStrideFieldIndex instance. It is likely part of a larger search or indexing functionality within the project.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the Guava library and the Lucene library.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The expected input is a ColumnStrideFieldIndex instance and a LeafReader instance, and the output is a NumericDocValues instance that can return the long value of a given doc ID. The code also includes methods for iterating through the docs and advancing to a specific target doc ID.
