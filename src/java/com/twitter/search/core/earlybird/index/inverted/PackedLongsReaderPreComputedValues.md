The `PackedLongsReaderPreComputedValues` class is used to pre-compute shifts, masks, and start int indices that are used by the `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class to decode packed values from the `IntBlockPool`. The purpose of this class is to improve decoding efficiency and speed. 

The class contains a constructor that takes in the maximum possible number of bits of packed values that will be decoded, the maximum number of values that are encoded back to back, the maximum number of ints used to store packed values, and a boolean flag indicating whether start int indices are needed for optimization. The constructor initializes 2D int arrays containing pre-computed start int indices, shifts, and masks for each possible bits per packed value. 

The `compute` method is used to compute the masks, shifts, and start indices for each possible bits per packed value. For each possible bits per packed value, the method computes the start int indices, low bits right shift, middle bits left shift, middle bits mask, high bits left shift, and high bits mask for each packed value. 

The class also contains getters for the pre-computed values. These getters return the pre-computed values, which should never be modified. 

This class is used in the larger project to improve the decoding efficiency and speed of packed values from the `IntBlockPool`. It is used by the `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class, which is used by other classes in the project, such as `HighDFPackedIntsDocsEnum` and `HighDFPackedIntsDocsAndPositionsEnum`. 

Example usage of this class can be found in the documentation of `HighDFPackedIntsDocsEnum` and `HighDFPackedIntsDocsAndPositionsEnum`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the project?
   - This class provides pre-computed shifts, masks, and start int indices for decoding packed values from IntBlockPool. It is used for decoding efficiency and speed.
2. What are the different situations when a packed value spans 1, 2, and 3 ints?
   - A packed value spans 1 int when it is stored from high bits to low bits in an int. A packed value spans 2 ints when the data is stored as low_bits_of_packed_value | other_data in one int and other_data | high_bits_of_packed_value in the next int. A packed value spans 3 ints when the data is stored as low_bits_of_packed_value | other_data in one int, ... middle_bits_of_packed_value ... in the next int, and other_data | high_bits_of_packed_value in the third int.
3. What are the parameters of the constructor and what is the purpose of each parameter?
   - The constructor takes in the max possible number of bits of packed values that will be decoded, the max number of values that are encoded back to back, the max number of ints that are used to store packed values, and a boolean flag indicating whether start int indices are needed for optimization. The purpose of each parameter is to set the maximum limits for the pre-computed values and to determine whether start int indices need to be computed.
