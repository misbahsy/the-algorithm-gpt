The QueryCostTracker class is a part of the Earlybird project from Twitter, which is a search engine that is optimized for real-time search. This class is responsible for tracking the cost of executing a query in terms of the number of posting list blocks accessed during the lifetime of the query. 

The class implements the QueryCostProvider interface, which defines a method called getTotalCost() that returns the total cost of executing a query. The class has a static method called getTracker() that returns an instance of the QueryCostTracker class. This method uses a CloseableThreadLocal object to ensure that each thread has its own instance of the QueryCostTracker class. 

The class has an enum called CostType that defines two types of costs: LOAD_REALTIME_POSTING_BLOCK and LOAD_OPTIMIZED_POSTING_BLOCK. Each cost type has a cost associated with it, which is defined in the constructor of the enum. 

The class has a method called track() that takes a CostType object as a parameter and adds the cost associated with the CostType object to the total cost of the query. The class also has a method called reset() that resets the total cost of the query to zero. 

This class is used in the Earlybird project to track the cost of executing a query and to optimize the search engine accordingly. For example, if a query is accessing a large number of posting list blocks, the search engine may decide to optimize the index to reduce the number of posting list blocks that need to be accessed. 

Example usage:

QueryCostTracker tracker = QueryCostTracker.getTracker();
tracker.track(QueryCostTracker.CostType.LOAD_REALTIME_POSTING_BLOCK);
double totalCost = tracker.getTotalCost(); // returns the total cost of the query
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code is a QueryCostTracker class that implements the QueryCostProvider interface. It tracks the cost of executing a Lucene query and is likely used in the search functionality of the project.
2. What is the significance of the CostType enum and how are its values used?
   - The CostType enum defines two types of costs associated with executing a query: LOAD_REALTIME_POSTING_BLOCK and LOAD_OPTIMIZED_POSTING_BLOCK. These values are used to calculate the total cost of executing a query by adding up the cost of each type of block accessed during the query.
3. What is the purpose of the CloseableThreadLocal class and how is it used in this code?
   - The CloseableThreadLocal class is used to create a thread-local instance of the QueryCostTracker class. This allows each thread to have its own instance of the tracker, which is important for multi-threaded applications where multiple threads may be executing queries simultaneously. The initialValue() method is called to create a new instance of the tracker for each thread that accesses it.
