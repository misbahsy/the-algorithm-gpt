The TimeMapper interface is a part of the Earlybird indexing system used by Twitter to index tweets and other documents. The purpose of this interface is to map timestamps to the document IDs assigned to the indexed documents. It provides methods to retrieve the time of the newest and oldest tweet in the index, as well as the timestamp of a document mapped to a given doc ID. Additionally, it provides a method to find the doc ID of the first indexed document with a timestamp equal to or greater than a given timestamp.

The findFirstDocId() method returns the doc ID of the first indexed document with a timestamp equal to or greater than the given timestamp. If the given timestamp is larger than the max timestamp in the mapper, the smallestDocID is returned. If the given timestamp is smaller than the min timestamp in the mapper, the largest docID is returned. However, when tweets are indexed out of order, this method might return the doc ID of a tweet with a timestamp greater than the given timestamp, even if there's a tweet with a timestamp of the given timestamp. Therefore, callers of this method should have a check that the traversed doc IDs have a timestamp in the desired range.

The optimize() method is used to optimize the time mapper at segment optimization time. When the doc IDs assigned to the documents in a segment change, the doc IDs stored in the time mapper for that segment need to be remapped accordingly. This method takes two DocIDToTweetIDMapper objects as parameters, one for the original doc ID mapper used by the segment before it was optimized, and one for the optimized doc ID mapper used by the segment after it was optimized. It returns an optimized TimeMapper with the same tweet IDs.

Overall, the TimeMapper interface is an important part of the Earlybird indexing system used by Twitter to index tweets and other documents. It provides methods to map timestamps to document IDs and retrieve information about the indexed documents. It is used in conjunction with other components of the Earlybird indexing system to provide a fast and efficient way to index and search tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines an interface for mapping timestamps to document IDs in an index used for searching tweets and users on Twitter. It is likely part of a larger search or indexing system for Twitter.

2. What is the significance of the ILLEGAL_TIME constant and how is it used?
- The ILLEGAL_TIME constant is set to the minimum integer value and is used as a default return value for the getTime method when the mapper does not know about a given document ID. This allows callers to handle the case where a document ID is not found in the mapper.

3. How does the findFirstDocId method handle tweets that are indexed out of order?
- The findFirstDocId method may return the doc ID of a tweet with a timestamp greater than the given time boundary, even if there is a tweet with a timestamp equal to the boundary. Callers of this method should use the returned doc ID as a starting point for iteration purposes, but should also check that the traversed doc IDs have a timestamp in the desired range.
