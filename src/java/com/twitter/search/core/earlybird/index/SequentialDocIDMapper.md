The `SequentialDocIDMapper` class is a doc ID mapper that assigns doc IDs sequentially in decreasing order, starting with the given max ID. This class is used by Expertsearch, which doesn't index tweets. 

The `SequentialDocIDMapper` class implements the `DocIDToTweetIDMapper` interface, which defines methods for mapping between tweet IDs and doc IDs. The `SequentialDocIDMapper` class has a constructor that takes a `maxSegmentSize` parameter, which is the maximum number of documents that can be indexed in a segment. The `lastAssignedDocId` field keeps track of the last doc ID that was assigned.

The `getTweetID` method takes a doc ID as input and returns the corresponding tweet ID. If the doc ID is outside the range of doc IDs assigned by this mapper, the method returns `ID_NOT_FOUND`. The `getDocID` method takes a tweet ID as input and returns the corresponding doc ID. If the tweet ID is outside the range of tweet IDs assigned by this mapper, the method returns `ID_NOT_FOUND`. The `getNumDocs` method returns the number of documents that have been assigned doc IDs by this mapper. The `getNextDocID` method takes a doc ID as input and returns the next doc ID that can be assigned by this mapper. The `getPreviousDocID` method takes a doc ID as input and returns the previous doc ID that was assigned by this mapper. The `addMapping` method takes a tweet ID as input and assigns a new doc ID to it. The new doc ID is one less than the last assigned doc ID.

The `SequentialDocIDMapper` class is used by Expertsearch to assign doc IDs to documents that are not tweets. The class is not used for indexing tweets because tweets are indexed using a different doc ID mapper. The `SequentialDocIDMapper` class is also used in tests to verify that doc IDs and tweet IDs are mapped correctly. 

Example usage:

```
SequentialDocIDMapper mapper = new SequentialDocIDMapper(1000);
int docId = mapper.addMapping(1234567890L);
long tweetId = mapper.getTweetID(docId);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a doc ID mapper that assigns doc IDs sequentially in decreasing order, starting with the given max ID. It is used by Expertsearch, which doesn't index tweets.

2. What is the significance of the `maxSegmentSize` parameter?
- The `maxSegmentSize` parameter is used to determine the upper bound of the range of doc IDs that can be assigned by this mapper.

3. What is the purpose of the `optimize()` method and why is it unsupported?
- The `optimize()` method is used to optimize segments that use this DocIDToTweetIDMapper, but it is unsupported because segments that use this mapper should never be optimized.
