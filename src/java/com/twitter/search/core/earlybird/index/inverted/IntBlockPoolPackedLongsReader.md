The `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class is responsible for reading packed values (int/long) written in `IntBlockPool`. This class is used in the larger project called "The Algorithm from Twitter". 

The class has two constructors, one with `queryCostTracker` and `queryCostType` set to null, and the other with these parameters as optional. The `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class has a `jumpToInt` method that sets the reader to start reading at the given int block pool pointer. The method updates shifts, masks, and start int indices based on the given number of bits per packed value. The `readPackedLong` method reads the next packed value as a long. The `getPackedValueIndex` method is a simple getter of `packedValueIndex`. The `setPackedValueIndex` method sets the `packedValueIndex` and also sets the correct `indexInCurrentBlock` based on `packedValueStartIndices`.

The `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class has several private helper methods. The `loadNextBlock` method loads a new int block from `intBlockPool`. If `queryCostTracker` is given, query cost with type `queryCostType` will be tracked as well. The `loadInt` method loads an int from `currentBlock`. If the `currentBlock` is used up, the next block will be automatically loaded.

In summary, the `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class reads packed values (int/long) written in `IntBlockPool`. It is used in the larger project called "The Algorithm from Twitter". The class has methods to set the reader to start reading at the given int block pool pointer and to read the next packed value as a long. The class also has private helper methods to load a new int block and to load an int from `currentBlock`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code is a packed ints reader for reading packed values (int/long) written in IntBlockPool. It is used to decode packed values and read them as longs. It is used in the project for various purposes such as in HighDFPackedIntsDocsEnum and HighDFPackedIntsDocsAndPositionsEnum.
2. What is the significance of the pre-computed values and how are they used in the code?
- The pre-computed values are shifts, masks, and start int indices used to decode packed ints. They are used to update shifts, masks, and start int indices based on the number of bits per packed value. They are used in the code to decode packed values as longs.
3. What is the purpose of the QueryCostTracker and how is it used in the code?
- The QueryCostTracker is used to track the query cost every time a new int block is loaded. It is used in the code to track the query cost with a specific type while loading a new block. It is an optional parameter in the constructor and can be set to null if not needed.
