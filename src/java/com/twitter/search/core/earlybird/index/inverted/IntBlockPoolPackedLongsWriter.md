The `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsWriter` class is responsible for writing packed integer and long values into an `IntBlockPool`. This class is used in conjunction with the `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class to read packed values from the `IntBlockPool`. 

The `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsWriter` class has a constructor that takes an `IntBlockPool` as a parameter. The `IntBlockPool` is the data structure that stores the packed values. The class has a method called `jumpToInt` that sets the writer to start writing at the given int block pool pointer and sets the number of bits per packed value that will be written. The method also resets the current int data to 0. The class has two methods for writing packed values: `writePackedInt` and `writePackedLong`. The `writePackedInt` method writes an integer value that is zero-extended to a long and then calls the `writePackedValueInternal` method to write the packed value. The `writePackedLong` method writes a long value that is unable to fit in an int and then calls the `writePackedValueInternal` method to write the packed value. 

The `writePackedValueInternal` method writes the given number of bits of the given value into the `IntBlockPool` as a packed int. The method extracts the lower `numBitsPerPackedValue` from the given value and writes it into the `currentIntValue` int. If the `currentIntValue` int is used up, the method flushes the `currentIntValue` int into the `IntBlockPool`. The method continues to write parts of the given value until all bits have been written. 

The `flush` method flushes the `currentIntValue` int into the `IntBlockPool` if any bits of the int are used. If the `currentIntValue` int is used up, the method increments the `currentIntPointer` and resets the `currentIntValue` and `currentIntBitIndex` to 0. 

Overall, the `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsWriter` class is an important component of the larger project as it provides a way to write packed integer and long values into an `IntBlockPool`. This class is used in conjunction with the `IntBlockPoolPackedLongsReader` class to read packed values from the `IntBlockPool`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a packed ints writer that writes packed values into an IntBlockPool. It is used in the earlybird index inverted package of the Twitter search core. 

2. What is the significance of the variables currentIntValue, currentIntBitIndex, and currentIntPointer? 
- currentIntValue is the value in the current position in the int block pool, currentIntBitIndex is the starting bit index of unused bits in currentIntValue, and currentIntPointer is the pointer of currentIntValue in the int block pool. These variables are used to keep track of the current state of the writer as it writes packed values into the int block pool. 

3. What is the purpose of the writePackedValueInternal method and how does it work? 
- The writePackedValueInternal method writes the given number of bits of the given value into the int pool as a packed int. It extracts the lower 'numBitsPerPackedValue' from the given value and writes it into the currentIntValue int. It then updates the currentIntBitIndex and flushes the currentIntValue into the int pool if it is used up. This process is repeated until all bits of the given value have been written.
