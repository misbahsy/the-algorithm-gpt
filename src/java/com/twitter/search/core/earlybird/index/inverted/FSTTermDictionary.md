The `FSTTermDictionary` class is a part of the Earlybird search engine project from Twitter. It is responsible for building and maintaining a finite state transducer (FST) data structure that maps terms to term IDs. The FST is built using the Lucene library and is used to efficiently look up terms during search queries. 

The `FSTTermDictionary` class implements the `TermDictionary` and `Flushable` interfaces. The `TermDictionary` interface defines methods for looking up terms by their byte representation and by their term ID. The `Flushable` interface defines methods for serializing and deserializing the `FSTTermDictionary` object to and from disk. 

The `FSTTermDictionary` class has several methods for building and querying the FST. The `buildFST` method builds the FST from a list of terms and their corresponding term IDs. The terms are first sorted using a custom comparator, and then added to the FST using the Lucene `Builder` class. The `createTermsEnum` method returns a `TermsEnum` object that can be used to iterate over the terms in the FST. The `lookupTerm` method looks up a term in the FST and returns its corresponding term ID. 

The `FSTTermDictionary` class also has methods for retrieving the byte representation of a term given its term ID, and for retrieving the number of terms in the dictionary. 

Overall, the `FSTTermDictionary` class is a critical component of the Earlybird search engine project from Twitter. It provides efficient term lookup capabilities using an FST data structure, which is essential for fast and accurate search queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code implements a term dictionary using a finite state transducer (FST) for efficient term lookup in Lucene indexes. It solves the problem of slow term lookup in large indexes.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `buildFST` method?
- The inputs of the `buildFST` method are a byte block pool, an array of term pointers, the number of terms, a comparator for sorting terms, a boolean flag for supporting term text lookup, and a term pointer encoding. The output is an instance of `FSTTermDictionary` built using the specified inputs.

3. What is the purpose of the `FlushHandler` class and how is it used?
- The `FlushHandler` class is used for flushing an instance of `FSTTermDictionary` to disk for later retrieval. It implements the `Flushable.Handler` interface and provides methods for serializing and deserializing the dictionary and its components. It is used in conjunction with a `DataSerializer` and `DataDeserializer` to write and read the dictionary to and from disk.
