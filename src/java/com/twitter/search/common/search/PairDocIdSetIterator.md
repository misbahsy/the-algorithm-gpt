The `PairDocIdSetIterator` class is a utility class that provides a disjunction over two `DocIdSetIterator` instances. This class is used to combine two sets of document IDs into a single set. This is useful in search applications where multiple queries are executed and the results need to be combined. 

The `PairDocIdSetIterator` class is designed to be faster than a disjunction over N `DocIdSetIterator` instances because there is no need to adjust the heap. The class works by iterating over the two `DocIdSetIterator` instances and returning the document IDs that are common to both sets. 

The `PairDocIdSetIterator` class has four methods: 

1. `PairDocIdSetIterator` - This is the constructor for the class. It takes two `DocIdSetIterator` instances as arguments and initializes the class variables. 

2. `docID` - This method returns the current document ID. 

3. `nextDoc` - This method returns the next document ID that is common to both sets. 

4. `advance` - This method advances the iterator to the document ID that is greater than or equal to the target. 

The `PairDocIdSetIterator` class is used in Lucene search applications to combine the results of multiple queries. For example, suppose we have two queries: 

```
Query q1 = new TermQuery(new Term("field1", "value1"));
Query q2 = new TermQuery(new Term("field2", "value2"));
```

We can execute these queries and combine the results using the `PairDocIdSetIterator` class: 

```
IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(index);
TopDocs docs1 = searcher.search(q1, 10);
TopDocs docs2 = searcher.search(q2, 10);
DocIdSetIterator iter1 = new BitSetIterator(docs1.bits(), docs1.scoreDocs.length);
DocIdSetIterator iter2 = new BitSetIterator(docs2.bits(), docs2.scoreDocs.length);
PairDocIdSetIterator pairIter = new PairDocIdSetIterator(iter1, iter2);
```

In this example, we execute two queries (`q1` and `q2`) and get the top 10 results for each query. We then create two `DocIdSetIterator` instances (`iter1` and `iter2`) from the results and pass them to the `PairDocIdSetIterator` constructor. The resulting `PairDocIdSetIterator` instance (`pairIter`) can be used to iterate over the combined results of the two queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `PairDocIdSetIterator` that performs a disjunction over two `DocIdSetIterator` objects.

2. What is the advantage of using `PairDocIdSetIterator` over a disjunction over N `DocIdSetIterator` objects?
- `PairDocIdSetIterator` is faster than a disjunction over N `DocIdSetIterator` objects because there is no need to adjust the heap.

3. What is the purpose of the `cost()` method?
- The `cost()` method provides a very coarse estimate of the number of documents that will be visited by this iterator.
