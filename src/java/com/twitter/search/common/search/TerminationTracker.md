The `TerminationTracker` class is used for tracking termination criteria for earlybird queries in the Twitter search system. It tracks the query time out and query cost, if they are set on the `CollectorTerminationParams`. 

The class has several instance variables, including `clientStartTimeMillis`, which is the query start time provided by the client, `timeoutEndTimeMillis`, which is the timeout end time calculated from `clientStartTimeMillis`, `localStartTimeMillis`, which is the query start time recorded at the earlybird server, `maxQueryCost`, which is the tracking query cost, and `postTerminationOverheadMillis`, which is the time reserved for work that needs to be done after early termination. 

The class has several methods, including `getTimeoutEndTimeWithReservation()`, which returns the reserve time to perform post-termination work, `setPreTerminationSafeBufferTimeMillis()`, which sets the pre-termination safe buffer time in milliseconds, `getLocalStartTimeMillis()`, which returns the query start time recorded at the earlybird server, `getClientStartTimeMillis()`, which returns the query start time provided by the client, `getMaxQueryCost()`, which returns the tracking query cost, `isEarlyTerminated()`, which returns whether the query has been early terminated, `getEarlyTerminationState()`, which returns the early termination state, and `setEarlyTerminationState()`, which sets the early termination state. 

The class also has several constructors, including `TerminationTracker(Clock clock)`, which creates a new termination tracker that will not specify a timeout or max query cost, `TerminationTracker(CollectorTerminationParams terminationParams, Clock clock, int postTerminationOverheadMillis)`, which creates a new termination tracker instance, and `TerminationTracker(CollectorTerminationParams terminationParams, long clientStartTimeMillis, Clock clock, int postTerminationOverheadMillis)`, which creates a new termination tracker instance with the specified parameters. 

Overall, the `TerminationTracker` class is an important component of the Twitter search system, as it allows for the tracking of termination criteria for earlybird queries. It is used to ensure that queries are terminated early if they exceed certain criteria, such as query time out or query cost.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code is used for tracking termination criteria for earlybird queries in the Twitter search project. It tracks query time out and query cost, and provides methods for getting and setting various parameters related to early termination.

2. What is the significance of the EarlyTerminationState enum and how is it used?
- The EarlyTerminationState enum is used to track the state of early termination for a query. It has three possible values: COLLECTING, TERMINATED, and TIMED_OUT. The state is set using the setEarlyTerminationState method and can be retrieved using the getEarlyTerminationState method.

3. What is the purpose of the getLastSearchedDocId method and how is it used?
- The getLastSearchedDocId method returns the minimum searched doc ID amongst all registered trackers, or -1 if there aren't any trackers. It is used to keep track of the last fully-searched doc ID when early termination occurs. The method is called internally and is not intended to be used externally.
