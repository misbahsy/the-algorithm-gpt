The `HitAttributeCollector` class is a utility class that collects and stores information about hits in a Lucene search query. It is not thread-safe, but it can be reused across different queries unless the size of the existing one is too small for a new huge serialized query. 

The class has two constructors, one of which takes a `BiFunction<Integer, Integer, FieldRankHitInfo>` as a parameter. This function is used to supply a `FieldRankHitInfo` instance. The `FieldRankHitInfo` class is a simple class that stores information about a hit, such as the field ID, rank, and document ID. 

The `HitAttributeCollector` class has a method called `newIdentifiableQuery` that creates a new `IdentifiableQuery` instance for the given query, field ID, and rank. This method also registers the field ID and the rank with the collector by adding a new `FieldRankHitInfo` instance to the `hitInfos` list. 

The `HitAttributeCollector` class also has three other methods: `clearHitAttributions`, `collectScorerAttribution`, and `getHitAttribution`. The `clearHitAttributions` method is used to reset the document ID and the `docBase` value. The `collectScorerAttribution` method is used to set the document ID for a hit. Finally, the `getHitAttribution` method is used to get hit attribution summary for the whole query tree. 

The `getHitAttribution` method has two overloaded versions. The first version returns a map from node rank to a set of matching field IDs. The second version returns a map from node rank to a set of matching objects (usually field IDs or names). Both versions do not contain entries for ranks that did not hit at all. 

Overall, the `HitAttributeCollector` class is a useful utility class that can be used to collect and store information about hits in a Lucene search query. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to provide more detailed information about search results. 

Example usage:

```
HitAttributeCollector collector = new HitAttributeCollector();
IdentifiableQuery query = collector.newIdentifiableQuery(myQuery, myFieldId, myRank);
// perform search
Map<Integer, List<Integer>> hitAttribution = collector.getHitAttribution(myDocId);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HitAttributeCollector` class?
- The `HitAttributeCollector` class is used to collect and store hit attribution information for Lucene queries.

2. Is the `HitAttributeCollector` class thread-safe?
- No, the `HitAttributeCollector` class is not thread-safe.

3. What is the purpose of the `getHitAttribution` method?
- The `getHitAttribution` method is used to retrieve hit attribution information for a given document ID and field ID mapping.
