The `IdentifiableQuery` class is a query implementation that adds attribute collection support for an underlying query. It extends the `Query` class from the Apache Lucene library and overrides several of its methods to provide additional functionality.

The class takes three parameters in its constructor: an inner query, a `FieldRankHitInfo` object, and a `HitAttributeCollector` object. The inner query is the underlying query that the `IdentifiableQuery` wraps around. The `FieldRankHitInfo` object is used to identify the query and the `HitAttributeCollector` object is used to collect attributes of the query's hits.

The `createWeight` method is overridden to create a new `IdentifiableQueryWeight` object that wraps around the inner query's weight. The `IdentifiableQueryWeight` object is responsible for collecting hit attributes during the search process.

The `rewrite` method is overridden to rewrite the inner query using the provided `IndexReader`. If the rewritten query is different from the original inner query, a new `IdentifiableQuery` object is created with the rewritten query.

The `hashCode` and `equals` methods are overridden to provide equality comparison between `IdentifiableQuery` objects. Two `IdentifiableQuery` objects are considered equal if their inner queries and query IDs are equal.

The `toString` method is overridden to return the string representation of the inner query.

The `getQueryForTest` and `getQueryIdForTest` methods are provided for testing purposes to retrieve the inner query and query ID, respectively.

Overall, the `IdentifiableQuery` class provides a way to identify and collect attributes of hits from an underlying query. It can be used in the larger project to enhance search functionality and provide more relevant search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code is a Query implementation that adds attribute collection support for an underlying query. It is used to identify and collect attributes of search results in the project.
2. What is the role of the `IdentifiableQueryWeight` class and how is it related to this code?
   - The `IdentifiableQueryWeight` class is returned by the `createWeight` method of this class and is used to score search results based on the attributes collected by the `HitAttributeCollector`. It is related to this code as it is used to implement the attribute collection functionality.
3. What is the purpose of the `getQueryForTest` and `getQueryIdForTest` methods and how are they used?
   - The `getQueryForTest` method returns the inner query for testing purposes, while the `getQueryIdForTest` method returns the query ID for testing purposes. They are used to facilitate testing of the `IdentifiableQuery` class and its related functionality.
