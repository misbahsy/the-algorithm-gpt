The `HitAttributeHelper` class is a generic helper class that contains the data needed to set up and collect field hit attributions. It implements the `HitAttributeProvider` interface and provides methods to add a new node and its respective rank to the helper's node-to-rank map, get hit attribution information indexed by node rank, and get the node-to-rank map and expanded node-to-rank map. 

The `HitAttributeHelper` class has four instance variables: `collector`, `fieldIdsToFieldNames`, `nodeToRankMap`, and `expandedNodeToRankMap`. The `collector` variable is an instance of the `HitAttributeCollector` class, which is used to collect hit attribution information. The `fieldIdsToFieldNames` variable is a function that maps field IDs to field names. The `nodeToRankMap` variable is a mapping of type `T` query nodes to rank ID. The `expandedNodeToRankMap` variable is meant to expand individual query nodes into multiple ranks, for example, expanding a multi-term disjunction to include a rank for each disjunction value.

The `HitAttributeHelper` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a `HitAttributeCollector` instance and a list of field names indexed by ID. The second constructor takes a `HitAttributeCollector` instance, a function that maps field IDs to field names, a node-to-rank map, and an expanded node-to-rank map.

The `HitAttributeHelper` class provides three public methods. The `getFieldRankHitAttributeCollector` method returns the `HitAttributeCollector` instance. The `getHitAttribution` method takes a document ID and returns a mapping from the query's node rank to a list of field names that were hit. The `addNodeRank` method takes a query node and its respective rank and adds them to the helper's node-to-rank map.

Overall, the `HitAttributeHelper` class is used to collect hit attribution information for a given query. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to provide search results with hit attribution information. Here is an example of how the `HitAttributeHelper` class might be used:

```
HitAttributeCollector collector = new HitAttributeCollector();
HitAttributeHelper helper = new HitAttributeHelper(collector, fieldIdsToFieldNames);
helper.addNodeRank(queryNode, rank);
Map<Integer, List<String>> hitAttribution = helper.getHitAttribution(docId);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a helper class for setting up and collecting field hit attributions in a search query.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Guava library for Maps.

3. What is the purpose of the ThreadLocal variables in this code?
- The ThreadLocal variables are used as a cache for hit attribution, so that the same computation does not need to be repeated for the same document ID.
