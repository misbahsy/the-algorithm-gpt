The `FilteredQuery` class is a Lucene query that combines a query and a filter to traverse the hits of a search. The query is used to iterate through the document IDs, while the filter is used to post-filter the results. This is useful when a query can quickly iterate through doc IDs, but an expensive filter is required to filter out the results. 

The `FilteredQuery` class has three inner classes: `FilteredQueryDocIdSetIterator`, `FilteredQueryScorer`, and `FilteredQueryWeight`. The `FilteredQueryDocIdSetIterator` class is a `DocIdSetIterator` that filters out doc IDs that do not match the filter. The `FilteredQueryScorer` class is a `Scorer` that scores documents based on the query and filter. The `FilteredQueryWeight` class is a `Weight` that calculates the relevance score of a document based on the query and filter.

The `FilteredQuery` class has two functional interfaces: `DocIdFilter` and `DocIdFilterFactory`. The `DocIdFilter` interface is a predicate that determines if a given doc ID should be accepted. The `DocIdFilterFactory` interface is a factory that creates `DocIdFilter` instances based on a given `LeafReaderContext` instance.

The `FilteredQuery` class is used to build a query that returns all documents that have at least 100 faves. The `min_faves 100` query is very expensive because it has to walk through every doc in the segment and extract the number of faves from the forward index. A conjunction between this query and the `HAS_ENGAGEMENT` filter is also slow because the `HAS_ENGAGEMENT` filter has to traverse the doc ID space faster, but the conjunction scorer would trigger an `advance(docID)` call on the `min_faves` part of the query, which has the same problem as the first option. The best option for this particular case is to drive by the `HAS_ENGAGEMENT` filter and use the `min_faves` filter as a post-processing step on a much smaller set of docs.

Example usage:

```
FilteredQuery filteredQuery = new FilteredQuery(query, docIdFilterFactory);
IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexReader);
TopDocs topDocs = searcher.search(filteredQuery, 10);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code defines a FilteredQuery class that pairs a Lucene query with a filter to do post-filtering. It is used to quickly iterate through doc IDs and filter out the ones that do not meet the filter criteria.

2. What are the main components of this code and how do they interact with each other?
- The main components of this code are the FilteredQuery class, DocIdFilter interface, DocIdFilterFactory interface, FilteredQueryDocIdSetIterator class, FilteredQueryScorer class, and FilteredQueryWeight class. They interact with each other to create a filtered query that can quickly iterate through doc IDs and filter out the ones that do not meet the filter criteria.

3. What are some potential performance issues with using this code and how can they be addressed?
- One potential performance issue is that the filter may be expensive to compute, which can slow down the query. This can be addressed by using a filter that is backed by a posting list, which can traverse the doc ID space faster. Another potential performance issue is that the query may have to walk through every doc in the segment, which can be very expensive. This can be addressed by using a smaller set of docs for post-processing.
