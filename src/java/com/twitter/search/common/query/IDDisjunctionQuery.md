The `IDDisjunctionQuery` class is an extension of Lucene's `MultiTermQuery` that creates a disjunction of long ID terms. It is used to search for documents that match a list of long IDs. The class takes a list of long IDs, a field name, and an `ImmutableSchemaInterface` object as input. The `ImmutableSchemaInterface` object is used to check if the field exists in the schema and if it is a numerical field. If the field does not exist or is not numerical, a `QueryParserException` is thrown.

The `IDDisjunctionQuery` class overrides the `getTermsEnum` method to return a `FilteredTermsEnum` that iterates over the list of long IDs and seeks the corresponding term in the index. The `Rewrite` class is a workaround for an issue where `LongTerms` are not valid utf8, so calling `toString` on any `TermQuery` containing a `LongTerm` may cause exceptions. The `Rewrite` class overrides the `rewrite` method to return a `MultiTermQueryConstantScoreWrapper` instance.

The `MultiTermQueryConstantScoreWrapper` class is a wrapper around the `IDDisjunctionQuery` instance that implements the `createWeight`, `bulkScorer`, `scorer`, `extractTerms`, and `isCacheable` methods. The `createWeight` method creates a `ConstantScoreWeight` instance that tries to rewrite the query as a boolean query if there are few terms, or builds a `DocIdSet` containing matching docs otherwise. The `bulkScorer` and `scorer` methods return a `BulkScorer` and a `Scorer` instance, respectively, that are used to score documents that match the query. The `extractTerms` method adds the terms used in the query to a set of terms. The `isCacheable` method returns `false` to indicate that the query is not cacheable.

Overall, the `IDDisjunctionQuery` class is used to search for documents that match a list of long IDs. It is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter and is used to implement search functionality. An example usage of the `IDDisjunctionQuery` class is shown below:

```
List<Long> ids = Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L);
String field = "id";
ImmutableSchemaInterface schemaSnapshot = ...;
IDDisjunctionQuery query = new IDDisjunctionQuery(ids, field, schemaSnapshot);
IndexSearcher searcher = ...;
TopDocs topDocs = searcher.search(query, 10);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it relate to Lucene's MultiTermQuery?
- This code creates a disjunction of long ID terms and extends Lucene's MultiTermQuery.
2. What is the significance of the useOrderPreservingEncoding boolean and how is it used in the code?
- The useOrderPreservingEncoding boolean is used to determine whether to use a sortable encoding for the long ID terms. It is used in the getTermsEnum and TermQueryWithToString methods to copy the long ID terms into a BytesRef.
3. How does the code handle fields that do not exist in the schema or fields that are not numerical?
- The code throws a QueryParserException if the field does not exist in the schema or if the requested id field is not numerical.
