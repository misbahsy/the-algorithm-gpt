The `CollectAnnotationsVisitor` class is a part of the Twitter search project and is responsible for collecting nodes with a specified annotation type in a given query. This class is used to traverse a query tree and collect all the nodes that have a specific annotation type. 

The class extends the `QueryVisitor` class and overrides its methods to visit different types of queries such as `Disjunction`, `Conjunction`, `Phrase`, `Term`, `Operator`, and `SpecialTerm`. The `visitQuery` method is called for each of these query types and checks if the query has the specified annotation type. If the query has the annotation type, the `collectNode` method is called to add the query to a map of nodes with the specified annotation type. 

The `visitBooleanQuery` method is called for `Disjunction` and `Conjunction` queries and recursively visits all the children of the query to collect nodes with the specified annotation type. 

The `getNodes` method returns a set of all the nodes that have the specified annotation type. 

This class can be used in the larger project to filter queries based on their annotations. For example, if we want to find all the queries that have a specific annotation type, we can create an instance of `CollectAnnotationsVisitor` with the desired annotation type and pass it to the `accept` method of a query. The `getNodes` method can then be used to retrieve all the nodes that have the specified annotation type. 

Here's an example of how this class can be used:

```
Query query = QueryParser.parse("hello world");
CollectAnnotationsVisitor visitor = new CollectAnnotationsVisitor(Annotation.Type.SOME_TYPE);
query.accept(visitor);
Set<Query> nodesWithAnnotation = visitor.getNodes();
```
## Questions:
