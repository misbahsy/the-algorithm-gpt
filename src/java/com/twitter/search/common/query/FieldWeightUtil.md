The `FieldWeightUtil` class provides methods for combining default field weight configuration with field annotations and returning a field-to-weight map. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves search functionality. 

The `combineDefaultWithAnnotation` method takes in a `Query` object, a `Map` of default field weights, a `Map` of enabled field weights, and two functions for converting between string field names and typed fields. It returns an `ImmutableMap` of typed fields to their corresponding weights. This method first retrieves all field and mappable field annotations from the query object. It then sanitizes the field annotations by removing any that do not correspond to a known field in the default field weight map. If there are no field annotations left after sanitization, the method returns the enabled field weight map. Otherwise, it applies the remaining field annotations to the enabled field weight map, either adding, removing, or replacing the weights of the corresponding fields. 

The `combineDefaultWithAnnotation` method with additional parameters takes in the same arguments as the previous method, as well as a `Map` of mappable fields to their corresponding typed fields and a function for converting typed fields to string field names. This method first converts the mappable field annotations to field annotations using the provided mapping. It then sanitizes the field annotations as before and applies them to the enabled field weight map. 

The `combineDefaultWithAnnotation` method with only three parameters is a convenience method that calls the previous method with the identity function for converting between string field names and typed fields. 

The `fieldAnnotationForMappableField` method is a private helper method that takes in a mappable field annotation and returns a field annotation with the same modifier and boost. It does this by first retrieving the corresponding typed field from the provided mapping, then converting it to a string field name using the provided function, and finally creating a new field annotation with the same boost and modifier as the mappable field annotation. 

Overall, the `FieldWeightUtil` class provides functionality for combining default field weights with field annotations, likely for use in search functionality in The Algorithm from Twitter project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility methods for combining default field weight configuration with field annotations and returning a field-to-weight map.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Guava library for various utility functions and the SLF4J library for logging.

3. What is the significance of the MappableField enum and how is it used in this code?
- The MappableField enum is used to map generic fields to specific typed fields. It is used in the `combineDefaultWithAnnotation` method to convert mapped fields to field annotations.
