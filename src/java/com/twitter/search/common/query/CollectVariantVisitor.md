The `CollectVariantVisitor` class is a subclass of `CollectAnnotationsVisitor` and is used to collect nodes that have the `:v` annotation. This class is a part of the `com.twitter.search.common.query` package and is likely used in the larger project to parse and analyze search queries.

The `CollectVariantVisitor` constructor calls the constructor of its superclass, `CollectAnnotationsVisitor`, and passes in the `Annotation.Type.VARIANT` parameter. This sets the type of annotation that the visitor will collect to `VARIANT`.

The purpose of this class is to traverse a search query and collect all nodes that have the `:v` annotation. This annotation is likely used to indicate a variant of a search term or phrase. For example, if a user searches for "cats", a variant of that search term could be "kittens". The `CollectVariantVisitor` would collect the node containing the "kittens" variant.

This class could be used in conjunction with other classes and methods to analyze search queries and provide more accurate search results. For example, the collected variants could be used to expand the search query and include similar terms, improving the relevance of the search results.

Here is an example of how this class could be used:

```
String query = "cats :v kittens";
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser();
QueryNode node = parser.parse(query);
CollectVariantVisitor visitor = new CollectVariantVisitor();
node.accept(visitor);
List<Node> variants = visitor.getAnnotations();
// variants contains the node containing the "kittens" variant
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the CollectAnnotationsVisitor class that CollectVariantVisitor extends?
- The CollectAnnotationsVisitor class is a visitor that collects nodes with specific annotations, and CollectVariantVisitor extends it to specifically collect nodes with the :v annotation.

2. What is the significance of the :v annotation?
- The :v annotation is significant because it is the specific annotation that CollectVariantVisitor is designed to collect nodes for.

3. How is this code used in the larger project?
- It is unclear from this code snippet alone how CollectVariantVisitor is used in the larger project, as it is just a small piece of code that defines a visitor class.
