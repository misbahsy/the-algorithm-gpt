The `CollectQueryTypeVisitor` class is a part of the Twitter search project and is used to collect nodes with a specified query type in a given query. This class is used to traverse a query tree and collect all the nodes that match a specified query type. 

The class extends the `QueryVisitor` class and overrides its methods to visit different types of queries such as `Disjunction`, `Conjunction`, `Phrase`, `Term`, `Operator`, and `SpecialTerm`. The `visit` methods return a boolean value indicating whether the query node matches the specified query type. If the node matches the query type, the `collectNode` method is called to add the node to the `nodeToTypeMap` map. 

The `getCollectedNodes` method returns a set of all the collected nodes. The `visitBooleanQuery` method is used to visit a `BooleanQuery` node and its children. If the `BooleanQuery` node matches the specified query type, it is added to the `nodeToTypeMap` map. The method then recursively visits all the children of the `BooleanQuery` node and returns a boolean value indicating whether any of the children matched the specified query type.

This class can be used in the larger Twitter search project to collect all the nodes of a specific query type in a given query. For example, if we want to collect all the `Phrase` nodes in a query, we can create an instance of the `CollectQueryTypeVisitor` class with the `Phrase` query type and pass it to the `accept` method of the root query node. The `getCollectedNodes` method can then be used to retrieve all the collected `Phrase` nodes. 

Example usage:

```
Query query = ... // create a query
CollectQueryTypeVisitor visitor = new CollectQueryTypeVisitor(Query.QueryType.PHRASE);
query.accept(visitor);
Set<Query> collectedNodes = visitor.getCollectedNodes();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a visitor class that collects nodes of a specified query type in a given query.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code uses the Guava library from Google for the Maps class.

3. How does this code handle exceptions?
   
   This code throws a QueryParserException in several methods, but it does not catch or handle any exceptions itself. It is up to the caller to handle any exceptions that may be thrown.
