The `QueryCommonFieldHitsVisitor` class is a visitor that traverses a search query and returns a set of hit fields in string representation. It is used to find query term hit intersections based on a hitmap given by `HitAttributeHelper`. 

The class contains two public static methods, `findIntersection`, which takes a `HitAttributeHelper`, a document ID, and a query, and returns a set of hit fields in string representation. The second `findIntersection` method takes a map of query node to its integer rank value, a map of rank to list of hit fields in string representation, and a query, and returns a set of hit fields in string representation. 

The `QueryCommonFieldHitsVisitor` class extends `SearchQueryVisitor<Set<String>>`, which is a visitor that traverses a search query and returns a set of strings. The class overrides several methods, including `visit(Disjunction)`, `visit(Conjunction)`, `visit(Term)`, `visit(SpecialTerm)`, `visit(SearchOperator)`, `visit(Link)`, and `visit(Phrase)`. 

The `visit(Disjunction)` method visits a disjunction node and returns the union of the fields amongst disjunctions. The method iterates over the children of the disjunction node and adds the hit fields of each child to a set. The method then returns the set of hit fields. 

The `visit(Conjunction)` method visits a conjunction node and returns the common fields among conjunctions. The method first checks if the list of children is empty. If it is not empty, the method initializes a set of hit fields and iterates over the children of the conjunction node. For each child, the method adds the hit fields to a set. If the set of hit fields is empty, the method continues to the next child. If the set of hit fields is not empty, the method initializes the set of hit fields to the set of hit fields of the first child. The method then iterates over the remaining children and retains only the hit fields that are common to all children. The method then returns the set of hit fields. 

The `visit(Term)` method visits a term node and returns the set of hit fields for the term. The method first gets the rank of the term node from a map of query node to its integer rank value. The method then gets the list of hit fields for the rank from a map of rank to list of hit fields in string representation. If the list of hit fields is not null, the method adds the hit fields to a set and returns the set. If the list of hit fields is null, the method returns an empty set. 

The `visit(SpecialTerm)` method visits a special term node and returns the set of hit fields for the special term. If the special term is a mention and contains an underscore, the method splits the mention into a phrase and returns the set of hit fields for the phrase. If the special term is not a mention or does not contain an underscore, the method returns the set of hit fields for the term or phrase. 

The `visit(SearchOperator)`, `visit(Link)`, and `visit(Phrase)` methods return an empty set of hit fields. 

Overall, the `QueryCommonFieldHitsVisitor` class is used to find query term hit intersections based on a hitmap given by `HitAttributeHelper`. It is a useful tool for analyzing search queries and determining which fields are being hit by the query.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a visitor to track the fields hits of each node and returns the common fields among conjunctions and the union of the fields amongst disjunctions.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Google Guava library.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The expected input is a query and a hitmap given by HitAttributeHelper, and the expected output is a set of hit fields in String representation.
