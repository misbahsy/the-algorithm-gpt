The `SingleDocDocIdSetIterator` class is a custom implementation of the `DocIdSetIterator` abstract class from the Apache Lucene library. It is designed to represent a set of document IDs that contains only a single document ID. 

The purpose of this class is to provide an efficient way to represent a set of document IDs when only a single document ID is needed. This can be useful in various search-related applications, such as filtering search results or computing document similarity scores. 

The class has a single constructor that takes an integer argument representing the document ID to be included in the set. The `doc` field is set to this value and is used throughout the class to represent the single document ID in the set. 

The `docID()` method returns the current document ID, which is initially set to -1. The `nextDoc()` method sets the current document ID to the value of `doc` if it is the first call to the method, and to `NO_MORE_DOCS` otherwise. The `advance()` method sets the current document ID to `NO_MORE_DOCS` if the target document ID is less than `doc`, and to `doc` otherwise. The `cost()` method returns a cost estimate of 1, indicating that iterating over this set of document IDs is relatively cheap. 

Overall, this class provides a simple and efficient way to represent a set of document IDs containing only a single document ID. It can be used in conjunction with other Lucene classes to perform various search-related tasks. 

Example usage:

```
SingleDocDocIdSetIterator set = new SingleDocDocIdSetIterator(42);
int docId = set.nextDoc();
if (docId == 42) {
  // do something with the document
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the project?
   - This class is a custom implementation of the `DocIdSetIterator` class from the Apache Lucene library. It is used to iterate over a set of document IDs, but in this case, it only contains a single document ID. 

2. What is the significance of the `docid` variable and how is it initialized?
   - The `docid` variable represents the current document ID being iterated over. It is initialized to -1 and is set to the value of `doc` (the only document ID in the list) when `nextDoc()` is called for the first time. 

3. Why does the `advance()` method return `docid` instead of the target document ID?
   - The `advance()` method is used to advance the iterator to the next document ID that is greater than or equal to the target document ID. In this implementation, if the target document ID is less than the only document ID in the list, the iterator is set to the end of the list (NO_MORE_DOCS). Therefore, the method returns `docid` (the current document ID) instead of the target document ID.
