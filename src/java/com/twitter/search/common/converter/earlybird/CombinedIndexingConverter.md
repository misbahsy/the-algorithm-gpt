The `CombinedIndexingConverter` class is responsible for building objects from `TwitterMessage` to `ThriftVersionedEvent`. It is used in tests and offline jobs, where all data is available on the `TwitterMessage`. This means that there is no need to split up the `ThriftVersionedEvents` into basic events and update events, like in the real-time pipeline using the `BasicIndexingConverter` and the `DelayedIndexingConverter`.

The class has a constructor that takes a `Schema` and an `EarlybirdCluster` as parameters. The `EncodedFeatureBuilder`, `Schema`, and `EarlybirdCluster` are initialized in the constructor. The `EncodedFeatureBuilder` is used to create tweet features from the `TwitterMessage`, while the `Schema` and `EarlybirdCluster` are used to build the `ThriftDocument`.

The `convertMessageToThrift` method takes a `TwitterMessage`, a boolean `strict`, and a list of `PenguinVersion` as parameters. It returns a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object. The method first checks that the `TwitterMessage` and `PenguinVersion` list are not null. It then creates a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object with the `TwitterMessage` ID. It then iterates over the `PenguinVersion` list and builds a `ThriftDocument` for each version using the `buildDocumentForPenguinVersion` method. The `ThriftIndexingEvent` is then created with the `ThriftDocument`, `ThriftIndexingEventType`, and `sortId`. The `uid` is set if it is present in the `TwitterMessage`. The `ThriftIndexingEvent` is then added to the `versionedEvents` map with the `PenguinVersion` byte value as the key.

The `buildDocumentForPenguinVersion` method takes an `ImmutableSchemaInterface`, `TwitterMessage`, `boolean`, and `PenguinVersion` as parameters. It returns a `ThriftDocument`. The method first creates tweet features from the `TwitterMessage` using the `EncodedFeatureBuilder`. It then creates an `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder` using the `BasicIndexingConverter`. The `BasicIndexingConverter` is used to build the basic fields, user fields, geo fields, retweet and reply fields, quotes fields, versioned feature fields, annotation fields, normalized min engagement fields, and directed at fields. The `DelayedIndexingConverter` is used to build the URL fields, card fields, and named entity fields. The `ThriftDocument` is then built using the `builder` object.

Overall, the `CombinedIndexingConverter` class is used to convert a `TwitterMessage` to a `ThriftVersionedEvent`. It is used in tests and offline jobs where all data is available on the `TwitterMessage`. The class uses the `EncodedFeatureBuilder`, `Schema`, and `EarlybirdCluster` to build the `ThriftDocument`. The `convertMessageToThrift` method creates a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object and iterates over the `PenguinVersion` list to build a `ThriftDocument` for each version. The `buildDocumentForPenguinVersion` method uses the `BasicIndexingConverter` and `DelayedIndexingConverter` to build the `ThriftDocument`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a converter that builds objects from TwitterMessage to ThriftVersionedEvent. It is used in tests and in offline jobs to convert TwitterMessage to a Thrift representation.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `convertMessageToThrift` method?
- The inputs of the `convertMessageToThrift` method are a TwitterMessage, a boolean value, and a list of PenguinVersion objects. The output is a ThriftVersionedEvents object.

3. What other classes does this code depend on and what is their purpose?
- This code depends on several other classes from different packages, such as `EncodedFeatureBuilder`, `Schema`, `EarlybirdCluster`, `ThriftDocument`, `ThriftIndexingEvent`, and others. These classes are used to build the Thrift representation of the TwitterMessage and to extract different features from it, such as user fields, geo fields, URL fields, retweet and reply fields, quotes fields, versioned feature fields, card fields, annotation fields, normalized min engagement fields, named entity fields, and directed at fields.
