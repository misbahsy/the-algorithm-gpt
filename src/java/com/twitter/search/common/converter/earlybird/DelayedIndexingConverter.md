The `DelayedIndexingConverter` class in this code is responsible for creating and populating `ThriftVersionedEvents` instances from the URL data, card data, and named entities contained in a `TwitterMessage`. This data is delayed because the services processing tweets take a few seconds, and the basic data available in the `BasicIndexingConverter` needs to be sent as soon as possible. Additional data is sent a few seconds later as an update.

The main method in this class is `convertMessageToOutOfOrderAppendAndFeatureUpdate`, which takes a `TwitterMessage` and a list of `PenguinVersion` objects as input. It returns a list of two `ThriftVersionedEvents` instances: the first one is a feature update event for all link and card related flags, and the second one is the append event that might contain updates to all link and card related fields.

The class also contains several helper methods for building various fields from the URL data, card data, and named entities. For example, `buildURLFields` builds URL-based fields from a tweet, `buildCardFields` builds card information inside `ThriftIndexingEvent`'s fields, and `buildNamedEntityFields` builds named entity fields.

This class is used in the larger project to handle the delayed processing of tweets and updating the index with additional data from external services. It ensures that the basic data is indexed quickly, while the additional data is added later as it becomes available.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DelayedIndexingConverter` class and when should it be used?
   **Answer**: The `DelayedIndexingConverter` class is used to create and populate `ThriftVersionedEvents` from the URL data, card data, and named entities contained in a `TwitterMessage`. It is used when the data source requires data from an external service and the external service takes at least a few seconds to process new tweets.

2. **Question**: How does the `convertMessageToOutOfOrderAppendAndFeatureUpdate` method work and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `convertMessageToOutOfOrderAppendAndFeatureUpdate` method takes a `TwitterMessage` and a list of `PenguinVersion`s as input, and converts the message into two `ThriftVersionedEvents` instances: one for feature updates related to link and card flags, and another for append events that might contain updates to all link and card related fields. It returns a list containing these two `ThriftVersionedEvents` instances.

3. **Question**: How does the `buildCardFields` method work and what information does it add to the `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder`?
   **Answer**: The `buildCardFields` method takes an `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder`, a `TwitterMessage`, and a `PenguinVersion` as input. It extracts card information from the `TwitterMessage` and adds it to the `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder`. This includes card title, card description, card name, card type, card language, card domain, and card URL, as well as information about whether the card is a video or not.
