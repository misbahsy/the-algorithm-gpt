The `BasicIndexingConverter` class in this code is responsible for converting a `TwitterMessage` object into a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object. This conversion is essential for indexing and searching tweets in the larger project. The class is marked as `@NotThreadSafe`, indicating that it should not be used concurrently by multiple threads.

The main method in this class is `convertMessageToThrift`, which takes a `TwitterMessage`, a boolean `strict`, and a list of `PenguinVersion` objects as input. It returns a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object that can be consumed by the Earlybird search engine. The method first initializes a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object with the tweet's ID and then iterates through the provided `PenguinVersion` objects to build a `ThriftDocument` for each version.

The `buildDocumentForPenguinVersion` method is responsible for constructing the `ThriftDocument` object. It calls various helper methods to build different fields of the document, such as basic fields, user fields, geo fields, retweet and reply fields, quotes fields, versioned feature fields, annotation fields, normalized minimum engagement fields, and directed-at fields.

For example, the `buildBasicFields` method sets fields like tweet ID, created_at timestamp, language codes, and various flags (e.g., offensive, nullcast, self_thread, exclusive). The `buildUserFields` method sets fields related to the user, such as user ID, screen name, and display name. The `buildGeoFields` method sets fields related to the tweet's geolocation, such as latitude, longitude, and place information.

These fields are then combined into a `ThriftDocument` object, which is added to the `ThriftVersionedEvents` object along with the corresponding `PenguinVersion`. This process is repeated for each `PenguinVersion` in the input list, resulting in a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object containing multiple versioned events that can be used for indexing and searching tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `BasicIndexingConverter` class and how does it relate to the overall project?
   **Answer**: The `BasicIndexingConverter` class is responsible for converting a `TwitterMessage` object into a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object, which is a generic data structure that can be consumed by Earlybird directly. It is part of the overall project that deals with processing and indexing Twitter data.

2. **Question**: How does the `convertMessageToThrift` method work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `convertMessageToThrift` method takes a `TwitterMessage` object, a boolean `strict` flag, and a list of `PenguinVersion` objects as inputs. It converts the `TwitterMessage` into a `ThriftVersionedEvents` object by building a `ThriftDocument` for each `PenguinVersion` and adding it to the `ThriftVersionedEvents` object. The method returns the resulting `ThriftVersionedEvents` object.

3. **Question**: How does the `buildGeoFields` method work and what information does it add to the `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder`?
   **Answer**: The `buildGeoFields` method takes an `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder`, a `TwitterMessage`, and a `VersionedTweetFeatures` object as inputs. It extracts the geolocation information from the `TwitterMessage` and adds it to the `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder`. This includes fields such as latitude, longitude, geohash, and place information.
