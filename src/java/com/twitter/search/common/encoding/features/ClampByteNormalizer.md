The `ClampByteNormalizer` class is a byte normalizer that restricts the values to a given range before normalizing them. This class extends the `ByteNormalizer` class and overrides its methods to provide the desired functionality. 

The purpose of this class is to ensure that the input values are within a specific range before they are normalized. This is useful in cases where the input values may be outside the expected range, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors. By restricting the input values to a specific range, the output of the normalization process is more predictable and consistent.

The `ClampByteNormalizer` class takes two parameters in its constructor: `minUnnormalizedValue` and `maxUnnormalizedValue`. These parameters define the range of allowed input values. The constructor also performs some checks to ensure that the input values are valid. Specifically, it checks that `minUnnormalizedValue` is less than or equal to `maxUnnormalizedValue`, that `minUnnormalizedValue` is greater than or equal to 0, and that `maxUnnormalizedValue` is less than or equal to 255.

The `normalize` method overrides the `normalize` method of the `ByteNormalizer` class. It takes a `double` value as input and returns a `byte` value as output. The input value is first cast to an `int` and then checked to ensure that it is within the allowed range. If the input value is less than `minUnnormalizedValue`, it is set to `minUnnormalizedValue`. If the input value is greater than `maxUnnormalizedValue`, it is set to `maxUnnormalizedValue`. The adjusted value is then passed to the `intToUnsignedByte` method of the `ByteNormalizer` class, which returns the normalized `byte` value.

The `unnormLowerBound` and `unnormUpperBound` methods override the corresponding methods of the `ByteNormalizer` class. These methods take a normalized `byte` value as input and return the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding unnormalized value. These methods are used to convert normalized values back to their original unnormalized values.

Overall, the `ClampByteNormalizer` class provides a useful tool for ensuring that input values are within a specific range before they are normalized. This can help to improve the consistency and predictability of the normalization process, which is important in many applications. 

Example usage:

```
ClampByteNormalizer normalizer = new ClampByteNormalizer(0, 100);
byte normalizedValue = normalizer.normalize(150.0);
double lowerBound = normalizer.unnormLowerBound(normalizedValue);
double upperBound = normalizer.unnormUpperBound(normalizedValue);
``` 

In this example, a `ClampByteNormalizer` object is created with a range of 0 to 100. The `normalize` method is then called with an input value of 150.0, which is outside the allowed range. The resulting normalized value is then passed to the `unnormLowerBound` and `unnormUpperBound` methods to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding unnormalized value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a byte normalizer that restricts the values to a given range before normalizing them.

2. What are the input and output of the `normalize` method?
- The input is a double value and the output is a byte value.

3. What are the constraints on the input values for the `ClampByteNormalizer` constructor?
- The minimum and maximum unnormalized values must be within the range of 0 to 255, and the minimum value must be less than or equal to the maximum value.
