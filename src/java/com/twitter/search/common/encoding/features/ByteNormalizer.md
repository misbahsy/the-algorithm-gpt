The `ByteNormalizer` class is an interface for compressing unbounded float values to a signed byte. It includes both normalization of values and encoding of values in a byte. This class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The class contains four methods and two static methods. The static methods are `intToUnsignedByte` and `unsignedByteToInt`. These methods convert an integer to an unsigned byte and vice versa. The `normalize` method returns the byte-compressed value of a double value. The `unnormLowerBound` and `unnormUpperBound` methods return a lower and upper bound to the unnormalized range of a byte value. The `changedNorm` method returns true if the normalized value of a double value is different than the normalized value of that value minus one.

This class can be used to compress float values to a signed byte, which can be useful in situations where storage space is limited. For example, in a search engine, where there are millions of documents, each with multiple features, compressing the feature values can save a significant amount of storage space. The `ByteNormalizer` class can be used to compress the feature values before storing them in a database or an index.

Here is an example of how to use the `ByteNormalizer` class:

```
ByteNormalizer normalizer = new MyByteNormalizer();
double value = 123.456;
byte compressedValue = normalizer.normalize(value);
double lowerBound = normalizer.unnormLowerBound(compressedValue);
double upperBound = normalizer.unnormUpperBound(compressedValue);
boolean changed = normalizer.changedNorm(value);
```

In this example, we create an instance of a class that implements the `ByteNormalizer` interface. We then compress a double value using the `normalize` method and get the lower and upper bounds of the unnormalized range using the `unnormLowerBound` and `unnormUpperBound` methods. Finally, we check if the normalized value of the double value has changed using the `changedNorm` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code defines an interface for compressing float values to a signed byte and includes methods for normalization and encoding. It is likely used in the project for data compression and storage purposes.

2. What is the expected range of input values for the `normalize` method?
   - The expected range of input values for the `normalize` method is not specified in the code. A smart developer may need to know this information to ensure that the method is being used correctly and to avoid unexpected behavior.

3. How does the `changedNorm` method determine if the normalized value of `val` is different than the normalized value of `val - 1`?
   - The `changedNorm` method determines if the normalized value of `val` is different than the normalized value of `val - 1` by calling the `normalize` method on both values and comparing the results. If the results are different, the method returns true.
