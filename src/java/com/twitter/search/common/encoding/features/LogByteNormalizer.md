The `LogByteNormalizer` class is responsible for normalizing values based on a logarithmic scale. The purpose of this normalization is to transform input values into a more manageable range for further processing. The normalization process is as follows:

- Positive numbers are normalized to (1 + round(log_baseN(value))), where N is the base of the logarithm. By default, the base is set to 2.
- Negative numbers will throw an exception.
- Zero is normalized to 0.

This class extends the `ByteNormalizer` class, which provides a framework for normalizing byte values. The `LogByteNormalizer` class overrides three methods from the parent class: `normalize`, `unnormLowerBound`, and `unnormUpperBound`.

The `normalize` method takes a double value as input and returns a byte value that represents the normalized value. If the input value is negative, an exception is thrown. If the input value is zero, the method returns 0. Otherwise, the logarithm of the input value is calculated using the base set in the constructor. The result is rounded and incremented by 1, then cast to a byte value. If the resulting value is greater than the maximum byte value, Byte.MAX_VALUE, it is capped at that value.

The `unnormLowerBound` and `unnormUpperBound` methods take a byte value as input and return the lower and upper bounds of the unnormalized value, respectively. These methods are used to reverse the normalization process and obtain the original value from the normalized byte value. The lower bound is calculated as base^(norm-1), where norm is the input byte value. The upper bound is calculated as base^norm. If the input byte value is negative or equal to Byte.MAX_VALUE, the lower or upper bound is set to negative or positive infinity, respectively.

This class can be used in the larger project to normalize input values before they are processed by other algorithms or models. For example, if the project involves machine learning, the input data may need to be normalized to improve the performance of the model. The `LogByteNormalizer` class provides a way to normalize the data on a logarithmic scale, which may be more appropriate for certain types of data. The class can be instantiated with a custom base value, allowing the user to adjust the scale of the normalization.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `LogByteNormalizer` that normalizes values based on a logarithmic scale with a specified base.

2. What is the default base used for normalization?
   - The default base used for normalization is 2.

3. What happens if a negative value is passed to the `normalize` method?
   - If a negative value is passed to the `normalize` method, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that negative values cannot be log-normalized.
