The `PredictionScoreNormalizer` class is a utility class that provides methods to normalize and denormalize a prediction score from a machine learning classifier. The purpose of this class is to convert a prediction score, which ranges within [0.0, 1.0], to an integer value by multiplying it by (10 ^ precision), and then rounding the result. The precision value determines the number of decimal places to be considered while multiplying the score. The lower the precision, the less amount of bits it takes to encode the score. 

The class has two public methods: `normalize` and `denormalize`. The `normalize` method takes a double value as input and returns the normalized integer value. The `denormalize` method takes an integer value as input and returns the denormalized double value. The `normalize` method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input score is not within the range [0.0, 1.0]. The `denormalize` method throws an `IllegalStateException` if the denormalized value is not within the range [0.0, 1.0].

The class constructor takes an integer value as input, which is used to calculate the normalizing base value. The normalizing base value is calculated as (10 ^ precision). This value is used to normalize and denormalize the prediction score.

This class can be used in a larger project that involves machine learning classifiers. The prediction score obtained from a machine learning classifier can be normalized using this class and then stored or transmitted as an integer value. The normalized score can be denormalized back to a double value when required. This can be useful in scenarios where the prediction score needs to be stored or transmitted in a compact format. 

Example usage:

```
PredictionScoreNormalizer normalizer = new PredictionScoreNormalizer(2);
double score = 0.75;
int normalizedScore = normalizer.normalize(score);
System.out.println("Normalized score: " + normalizedScore);
double denormalizedScore = normalizer.denormalize(normalizedScore);
System.out.println("Denormalized score: " + denormalizedScore);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a normalizer that converts a prediction score from a machine learning classifier, which ranges within [0.0, 1.0], to an integer value by multiplying by (10 ^ precision), and returns the rounded value.

2. What is the significance of the precision parameter?
- The precision parameter determines the number of decimal places to be used in the normalization process. The lower the precision, the less amount of bits it takes to encode the score.

3. What exceptions can be thrown by the normalize and denormalize methods?
- The normalize method can throw an IllegalArgumentException when the input score is not within [0.0, 1.0]. The denormalize method can throw an IllegalStateException when the denormalized value is not within [0.0, 1.0].
