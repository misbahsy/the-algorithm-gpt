The `SingleBytePositiveFloatUtil` class provides utility methods for encoding and decoding positive Java floats into single byte floats. This is useful for reducing the size of data that needs to be stored or transmitted. 

The encoding process involves representing the float as a mantissa and exponent, where the mantissa is a 4-bit value representing a range from 1.0 to 9.0, and the exponent is a 4-bit value representing a base 10 exponent. The formula used to calculate the float value from the mantissa and exponent is `Max(Mantissa, 9) * 10 ^ (Exponent - 1)`. The encoded float can take on values between 0.0 and 9.0 * 10^13, with special values for infinity and NaN.

The `toSingleBytePositiveFloat` method takes a Java float as input and returns the corresponding single byte float. If the input float is negative, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown. If the input float is infinity or NaN, the corresponding special value is returned. Otherwise, the mantissa and exponent are calculated and used to encode the float.

The `toJavaFloat` method takes a single byte float as input and returns the corresponding Java float. If the input byte represents infinity or a value greater than the largest possible value, `Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY` or `Float.NaN` is returned, respectively. Otherwise, the mantissa and exponent are extracted from the byte and used to calculate the float value.

The class also contains several tables used for converting between mantissa and fraction values, as well as for caching results from byte to float conversion. The `toLog2Double` method converts a normalized byte to the log2() version of its original value.

Overall, this class provides a useful utility for encoding and decoding positive floats as single bytes, which can be used to reduce the size of data in storage or transmission.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code is used to encode and decode positive Java floats into a single byte float. It is used in the project for converting floats into a more compact format for storage and transmission.

2. What is the range of values that can be encoded and decoded using this code?
- The smallest float that can be encoded is 0.0 and the largest float is 9.0 * 10^13. The encoded values are represented by a single byte, with the higher 4 bits representing the exponent and the lower 4 bits representing the mantissa.

3. How does this code handle edge cases such as negative floats, infinity, and NaN?
- Negative floats cannot be encoded using this code and will result in an UnsupportedOperationException. Infinity is represented by a specific byte value, while NaN is represented by another specific byte value. The code also handles overflow and underflow cases by returning the largest possible value or 0, respectively.
