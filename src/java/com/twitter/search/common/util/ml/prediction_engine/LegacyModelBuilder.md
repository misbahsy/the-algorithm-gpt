The LegacyModelBuilder class is a builder for a machine learning model based on legacy (non-schema-based) features. It is used to create a LightweightLinearModel object that can be used for prediction. This class extends the BaseModelBuilder class and overrides its addFeature and build methods. 

The constructor of the LegacyModelBuilder class takes two arguments: modelName and context. The modelName argument is a string that represents the name of the model being built. The context argument is a FeatureContext object that contains all the features that can be used to build the model. 

The LegacyModelBuilder class has three instance variables: featuresByName, binaryFeatures, and continuousFeatures. The featuresByName variable is a map that maps feature names to Feature objects. The binaryFeatures variable is a map that maps binary features to their weights. The continuousFeatures variable is a map that maps continuous features to their weights. 

The addFeature method is used to add a feature to the model being built. It takes three arguments: baseName, weight, and parser. The baseName argument is a string that represents the name of the feature being added. The weight argument is a double that represents the weight of the feature being added. The parser argument is a FeatureParser object that is used to parse the feature being added. 

The build method is used to build the machine learning model. It creates a map of discretized features and their corresponding DiscretizedFeature objects. It then creates a LightweightLinearModel object using the modelName, bias, binaryFeatures, continuousFeatures, and discretizedFeatures. 

Overall, the LegacyModelBuilder class is an important part of the machine learning algorithm used by Twitter. It is used to build a machine learning model based on legacy features, which can then be used for prediction. 

Example usage:

```
FeatureContext context = new FeatureContext();
// add features to context
LegacyModelBuilder modelBuilder = new LegacyModelBuilder("myModel", context);
// add features to model builder
LightweightLinearModel model = modelBuilder.build();
// use model for prediction
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a builder for a model based on legacy features, which is used for prediction engine in machine learning.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses Guava library for HashMultimap and Maps.

3. What is the difference between this LegacyModelBuilder and SchemaBasedModelBuilder?
- The LegacyModelBuilder is used for legacy features, while the SchemaBasedModelBuilder is used for schema-based features.
