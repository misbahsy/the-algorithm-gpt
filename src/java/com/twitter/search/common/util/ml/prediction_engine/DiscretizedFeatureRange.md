The `DiscretizedFeatureRange` class is a part of the prediction engine utility package for the Twitter search algorithm. This class is responsible for storing the range and weight of a discretized binary feature that was once a continuous feature. 

When a continuous feature is discretized, it is split into multiple binary features, each occupying a range. This class stores the minimum and maximum values of the range and a weight for that range. The weight represents the importance of that range in predicting the outcome of the search algorithm. 

The constructor of the `DiscretizedFeatureRange` class takes in a weight and a range as input parameters. The range is a string that contains the minimum and maximum values of the range separated by an underscore. The constructor then parses the range string and initializes the `minValue`, `maxValue`, and `weight` variables of the class. 

The `parseRangeValue` method is a private helper method that is used to parse the minimum and maximum values of the range string. If the value is "inf", it returns `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. If the value is "-inf", it returns `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. Otherwise, it parses the value as a double and returns it. 

This class is used in the larger prediction engine utility package to store the discretized binary features of a continuous feature. It allows the search algorithm to make predictions based on the discretized binary features and their corresponding weights. 

Example usage:

```
DiscretizedFeatureRange range = new DiscretizedFeatureRange(0.5, "-1.0_1.0");
double minValue = range.minValue; // returns -1.0
double maxValue = range.maxValue; // returns 1.0
double weight = range.weight; // returns 0.5
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the larger project?
- This class represents the range of values for a discretized continuous feature and its weight. It is likely used in a machine learning prediction engine to make predictions based on input features.

2. What is the format of the input range parameter in the constructor?
- The input range parameter is expected to be a string in the format "minValue_maxValue", where the values can be numeric or the strings "inf" or "-inf" to represent positive or negative infinity.

3. What happens if the input range parameter is not in the expected format?
- If the input range parameter is not in the expected format of "minValue_maxValue", an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
