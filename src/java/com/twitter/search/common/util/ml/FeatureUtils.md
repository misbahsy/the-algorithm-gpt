The `FeatureUtils` class provides utility methods for feature transformation and extraction. The class contains three methods that compute the difference between two values, the cosine similarity between two sparse vectors, and the cosine similarity between two dense vectors. Additionally, the class contains a method that finds the key of the map with the highest value.

The `diffRatio` method computes the difference between two values and returns the ratio of the difference over the minimum of both. The method is used to define a feature that tells how much larger or smaller the first value is with respect to the second one. The method takes three parameters: `a` and `b` are the two values to compare, and `maxRatio` is the upper/lower limit of the ratio. The method returns a float that represents the ratio between the two values.

The `cosineSimilarity` method computes the cosine similarity between two maps that represent sparse vectors. The method takes two parameters: `vector1` and `vector2` are the two maps to compare. The method returns a double that represents the cosine similarity between the two vectors.

The `cosineSimilarity` method also computes the cosine similarity between two dense vectors. The method takes two parameters: `vector1` and `vector2` are the two dense vectors to compare. The method returns a double that represents the cosine similarity between the two vectors.

The `findMaxKey` method finds the key of the map with the highest value (compared in natural order). The method takes one parameter: `map` is the map to search. The method returns an optional that contains the key of the map with the highest value.

These methods are useful for feature extraction and transformation in machine learning applications. For example, the `cosineSimilarity` method can be used to compute the similarity between two documents in a document classification task. The `diffRatio` method can be used to compare the prices of two products in a recommendation system. The `findMaxKey` method can be used to find the most frequent word in a text corpus.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utilities for feature transformation and extraction, including methods for computing the difference between two values, cosine similarity between two maps or vectors, and finding the key of a map with the highest value.

2. What is the input and output of the `diffRatio` method?
- The `diffRatio` method takes in two float values and a maxRatio value, and returns a float value representing the ratio of the difference between the two input values over the minimum of both. The output is bounded by the upper/lower limit of maxRatio.

3. What is the difference between the `cosineSimilarity` method for maps and for lists?
- The `cosineSimilarity` method for maps takes in two maps that represent sparse vectors, while the method for lists takes in two dense vectors represented as lists. The implementation of the two methods is different, but both compute the cosine similarity between the two input vectors.
