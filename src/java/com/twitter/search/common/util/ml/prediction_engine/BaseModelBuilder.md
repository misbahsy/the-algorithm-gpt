The `BaseModelBuilder` class is a base model builder for `LightweightLinearModels`. It provides a method to parse a line from an interpreted model text file and a method to build a feature. The class is abstract and provides an abstract method to add a feature to the model and an abstract method to build a `LightweightLinearModel`. 

The `BaseModelBuilder` class has a `MIN_WEIGHT` constant that is used to ignore features that have an absolute weight lower than this value. It also has a `BIAS_FIELD_NAME` constant that is used to identify the bias field in the interpreted model text file. The class has a `DISCRETIZER_NAME_SUFFIX` constant that is used to identify the suffix of the name of a discretized feature.

The `BaseModelBuilder` class has a constructor that takes a `modelName` parameter and initializes the `modelName` and `bias` fields. The `bias` field is initialized to 0.0.

The `BaseModelBuilder` class has a `buildFeature` method that takes a collection of `DiscretizedFeatureRange` objects and returns a `DiscretizedFeature` object. The method sorts the ranges by their minimum value and builds an array of splits and an array of weights. It then returns a `DiscretizedFeature` object that contains the splits and weights arrays.

The `BaseModelBuilder` class has a `parseLine` method that takes a line from an interpreted model text file and returns a `ModelBuilder` object. The method parses the line and extracts the feature name and weight. If the feature name is the bias field name, it sets the bias field to the weight and returns the `ModelBuilder` object. If the feature weight is less than the minimum weight and the feature name does not end with the discretizer name suffix, it returns the `ModelBuilder` object. Otherwise, it adds the feature to the model by calling the `addFeature` method and returns the `ModelBuilder` object.

The `BaseModelBuilder` class is used in the larger project to build `LightweightLinearModels`. Subclasses of `BaseModelBuilder` implement the `addFeature` and `build` methods to build specific types of `LightweightLinearModels`. The `parseLine` method is used to parse lines from interpreted model text files that contain the weights of the features in the model. The `buildFeature` method is used to build discretized features.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the BaseModelBuilder class?
- The BaseModelBuilder class is the base model builder for LightweightLinearModels.
2. What is the significance of the MIN_WEIGHT constant?
- The MIN_WEIGHT constant is used to ignore features that have an absolute weight lower than its value.
3. What is the format of the interpreted model text file that the parseLine method parses?
- The interpreted model text file uses TSV format with 3 columns: Model name, Feature definition, and Weight.
