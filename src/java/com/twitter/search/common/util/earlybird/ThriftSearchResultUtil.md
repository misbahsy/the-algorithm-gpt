The `ThriftSearchResultUtil` class contains a set of static methods for constructing and manipulating `ThriftSearchResult` objects. These objects are used to represent search results in the Earlybird search system. 

The class contains several useful methods for working with `ThriftSearchResults` objects, including `numResults`, which returns the number of results in a `ThriftSearchResults` object, and `getTweetIds`, which returns a list of tweet IDs from a `ThriftSearchResults` object. 

The class also contains several useful `Predicate` objects for filtering `ThriftSearchResult` objects based on various criteria, such as whether a tweet is offensive or whether it is a top tweet. 

Other methods in the class include `getTweetMetadataMap`, which returns a map of tweet IDs to their corresponding metadata, and `removeDuplicates`, which removes duplicate `ThriftSearchResult` objects from a list. 

Overall, the `ThriftSearchResultUtil` class provides a set of useful utility methods for working with `ThriftSearchResult` objects in the Earlybird search system. 

Example usage:

```
ThriftSearchResults results = ... // some search results
int numResults = ThriftSearchResultUtil.numResults(results);
List<Long> tweetIds = ThriftSearchResultUtil.getTweetIds(results);
List<ThriftSearchResult> filteredResults = results.getResults().stream()
    .filter(ThriftSearchResultUtil.IS_TOP_TWEET)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```
