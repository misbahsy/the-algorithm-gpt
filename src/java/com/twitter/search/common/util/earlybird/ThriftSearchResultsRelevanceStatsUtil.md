The `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil` class provides a utility method for adding relevance statistics from one set of search results to another. The class takes in two `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` objects, `base` and `delta`, and adds the values of each field in `delta` to the corresponding field in `base`. 

The purpose of this class is to allow for the aggregation of search results relevance statistics across multiple searches. For example, if a user performs multiple searches on Twitter, this class can be used to combine the relevance statistics from each search into a single set of statistics. 

The `addRelevanceStats` method assumes that all values are set on both `base` and `delta`. It then adds the values of each field in `delta` to the corresponding field in `base`. The fields include the number of scored tweets, skipped tweets, and skipped tweets for various reasons such as anti-gaming, low reputation, low text score, and social filter. The method also updates the oldest scored tweet age in seconds, the number of tweets from direct follows, trusted circles, replies, and tweets with media or news. Finally, it updates the number of spam, offensive, and bot tweets. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a larger project:

```java
ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats baseStats = new ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats();
ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats deltaStats = new ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats();

// perform a search and populate deltaStats with the relevance statistics
search(query, deltaStats);

// add the relevance statistics from the search to the base statistics
ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil.addRelevanceStats(baseStats, deltaStats);

// perform another search and repeat the process
search(query2, deltaStats);
ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil.addRelevanceStats(baseStats, deltaStats);

// use the aggregated relevance statistics for analysis or display
displayStats(baseStats);
``` 

In this example, `baseStats` is initialized as an empty `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` object. After each search, the relevance statistics for that search are stored in `deltaStats`. The `addRelevanceStats` method is then used to add the relevance statistics from `deltaStats` to `baseStats`. This process is repeated for each search, resulting in a single set of aggregated relevance statistics stored in `baseStats`. Finally, the aggregated statistics can be used for analysis or display.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code provides a utility method for adding `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` from one set of results onto a base set.

2. What are the input parameters for the `addRelevanceStats` method?
   - The `addRelevanceStats` method takes in two parameters: `base` and `delta`, both of which are of type `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats`.

3. What does the `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil` class do?
   - The `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil` class provides a static method `addRelevanceStats` for adding `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` from one set of results onto a base set. It also has a private constructor, indicating that it is a utility class and cannot be instantiated.
