The `ResponseMergerUtils` class is a utility class that provides a method for merging early termination information from multiple `EarlybirdResponse` objects. The purpose of this class is to help with the processing of search queries in the larger project.

The `mergeEarlyTerminationInfo` method takes a list of `EarlybirdResponse` objects as input and returns a merged `EarlyTerminationInfo` object. The `EarlyTerminationInfo` object contains information about whether a search query was terminated early and the reason for the early termination.

The method first creates a new `EarlyTerminationInfo` object with an initial value of `false` for the `earlyTerminated` field. It also creates a new `HashSet` to store the unique early termination reasons from the input responses.

The method then iterates over each `EarlybirdResponse` object in the input list. If the response contains early termination information and the query was terminated early, the `earlyTerminated` field in the `etInfo` object is set to `true`. The method also adds the early termination reason to the `etReasonSet`. If the response contains merged early termination reasons, the method adds them to the `etReasonSet` as well.

Finally, if the `earlyTerminated` field in the `etInfo` object is `true`, the method creates a new `ArrayList` containing the unique early termination reasons from the `etReasonSet` and sets it as the value of the `mergedEarlyTerminationReasons` field in the `etInfo` object.

This class and method are likely used in the larger project to help determine when to terminate a search query early and why. For example, if multiple responses indicate that a query was terminated early due to a high volume of results, the project may use this information to adjust the query parameters or provide feedback to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a utility class called `ResponseMergerUtils` that provides a method to merge early termination information from several `EarlybirdResponse` objects.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    
    This code uses the `com.google.common.collect` and `com.twitter.search.common.query.thriftjava` packages.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `mergeEarlyTerminationInfo` method?
    
    The `mergeEarlyTerminationInfo` method takes a list of `EarlybirdResponse` objects as input and returns a merged `EarlyTerminationInfo` object. The merged object contains information about whether the search was early terminated and the reasons for early termination.
