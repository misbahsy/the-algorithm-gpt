The EarlybirdResponseUtil class provides utility methods that work on EarlybirdResponses. The EarlybirdResponse is a response object that is returned by the Earlybird search engine. This class provides methods to extract the results from the EarlybirdResponse, determine if the response has results, and get the number of results in the response. It also provides methods to determine if the response is early-terminated and if the response should be considered failed for purposes of stats and logging.

The class provides methods to extract the real-time response from an existing response and to find all unexpected nullcast statuses within the given result. It also provides methods to log the Earlybird response as a candidate source and to return an EarlybirdResponse that should be returned by roots when a tier was skipped.

The class is designed to be used in the larger Earlybird search engine project. It provides a set of utility methods that can be used by other classes in the project to work with EarlybirdResponses. For example, the extractResultsFromEarlybirdResponse method can be used to extract the results from an EarlybirdResponse and process them further. The debugLogAsCandidateSource method can be used to log the Earlybird response as a candidate source for debugging purposes.

Overall, the EarlybirdResponseUtil class provides a set of utility methods that can be used to work with EarlybirdResponses in the Earlybird search engine project. It provides a convenient way to extract and process the results from an EarlybirdResponse and to log the response for debugging purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility methods that work on EarlybirdResponses.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several ThriftJava classes and the Google Guava library.

3. What is the significance of the `isSuccessfulResponse` method?
- The `isSuccessfulResponse` method determines if the given response is a success response, which is defined as having a SUCCESS, TIER_SKIPPED, or REQUEST_BLOCKED_ERROR response code.
