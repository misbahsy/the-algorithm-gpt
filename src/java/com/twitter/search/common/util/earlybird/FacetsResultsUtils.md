The `FacetsResultsUtils` class in this code provides utility functions for processing facets results in the context of the Twitter search project. Facets are used to categorize and filter search results based on specific criteria, such as language, user, or content type.

The class contains several methods for handling facets results, such as:

- `prepareFieldInfoMap()`: Prepares a map of facet field information and checks if termStats filtering is needed.
- `fillFacetFieldInfo()`: Extracts information from `ThriftFacetResults` and fills the facet field information map and user ID whitelist.
- `mergeFacetMetadata()`: Merges metadata from two `ThriftFacetCountMetadata` objects, taking into account user ID whitelisting.
- `mergeTwimgResults()`: Merges twimg (Twitter image) results into image results, optionally resorting the image results based on a provided comparator.
- `dedupTwimgFacet()`: Deduplicates twimg facets by checking native photo URLs and removing duplicates.
- `fillTopLanguages()`: Calculates the top languages from the language histogram and stores them in the results.
- `fixNativePhotoUrl()`: Replaces the "p.twimg.com" part of the native photo URL with "pbs.twimg.com/media/" for compatibility reasons.
- `deepCopyWithoutExplanation()`: Creates a deep copy of an `EarlybirdResponse` without the explanation field.
- `getFacetCountComparator()`: Returns a comparator for sorting facet counts based on the specified sort order.

These utility functions can be used in the larger project to process and manipulate facets results, helping to improve the quality and relevance of search results. For example, the `fillTopLanguages()` method can be used to identify the most common languages in a set of search results, allowing the system to prioritize or filter results based on language preferences.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `FacetsResultsUtils` class and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `FacetsResultsUtils` class is a utility class that provides functions for processing facets results, such as preparing facet fields, extracting information from `ThriftFacetResults`, merging facet metadata, and calculating top languages.

2. **Question**: How does the `fillTopLanguages` method work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `fillTopLanguages` method calculates the top languages from the given `FacetFieldInfo` and stores them in the provided `ThriftFacetFieldResults`. It computes the language histogram and selects the top languages based on the specified minimum percentage sum and minimum percentage.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `fixNativePhotoUrl` method and when should it be used?
   **Answer**: The `fixNativePhotoUrl` method replaces the "p.twimg.com/" part of the native photo (twimg) URL with "pbs.twimg.com/media/". This is a temporary measure due to blobstore requirements and should be removed once all native photo URLs sent to Search are prefixed with "pbs.twimg.com/media/" and no native photo URL in the index contains "p.twimg.com/".
