The `ThriftSearchQueryUtil` class is a utility class that provides methods for constructing a `ThriftSearchQuery` object, which is used in the larger project for searching and collecting data. The class is located in the `com.twitter.search.common.util.earlybird` package.

The `ThriftSearchQueryUtil` class has a private constructor, which means that it cannot be instantiated. This is because it only provides static methods for constructing `ThriftSearchQuery` objects.

The `newSearchQuery` method is a convenience method that takes in two parameters: a serialized query string and the number of results to return. It creates a new `ThriftSearchQuery` object, sets the serialized query string and the number of results to return in the `CollectorParams` object, and returns the `ThriftSearchQuery` object.

Here is an example of how to use the `newSearchQuery` method:

```
ThriftSearchQuery searchQuery = ThriftSearchQueryUtil.newSearchQuery("some serialized query", 10);
```

The `requestInitiatedByLoggedInUser` method takes in an `EarlybirdRequest` object and determines if the request was initiated by a logged-in user. It does this by checking if the `ThriftSearchQuery` object in the `EarlybirdRequest` object is not null, if the `searcherId` field is set, and if the `searcherId` field is greater than 0. If all of these conditions are true, then the method returns true, indicating that the request was initiated by a logged-in user.

Here is an example of how to use the `requestInitiatedByLoggedInUser` method:

```
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();
// set the search query in the request
boolean initiatedByLoggedInUser = ThriftSearchQueryUtil.requestInitiatedByLoggedInUser(request);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a utility class for constructing a ThriftSearchQuery used in the Twitter search functionality.

2. What parameters are required to create a new ThriftSearchQuery using this code?
- The method `newSearchQuery` requires a serialized query string and an integer value for the number of results to return.

3. What is the significance of the `requestInitiatedByLoggedInUser` method?
- This method determines if a given search request was initiated by a logged in user by checking if the `searcherId` field in the `ThriftSearchQuery` object is set to a value greater than 0.
