The `ThriftLanguageUtil` class provides methods to convert between `ThriftLanguage` and `Locale` objects. It contains static methods that can be used to get the corresponding `Locale` object for a given `ThriftLanguage` object, and vice versa. It also provides a method to get the `ThriftLanguage` object for a given language code. 

The class initializes two static variables, `LOCALES` and `THRIFT_LANGUAGES`, which store mappings between `ThriftLanguage` and `Locale` objects. The `LOCALES` array stores `Locale` objects at indices corresponding to the `ThriftLanguage` values. The `THRIFT_LANGUAGES` map stores `ThriftLanguage` objects as values and their corresponding `Locale` objects as keys. 

The `getLocaleOf` method takes a `ThriftLanguage` object as input and returns the corresponding `Locale` object. If the input is null, it returns an `UNKNOWN` `Locale` object. The `getThriftLanguageOf` method takes a `Locale` object as input and returns the corresponding `ThriftLanguage` object. If there is no corresponding `ThriftLanguage` object, it returns `UNKNOWN`. The `getThriftLanguageOf` method also has an overload that takes a language code as input and returns the corresponding `ThriftLanguage` object. 

The `safeFindByValue` method takes an integer value as input and returns the corresponding `ThriftLanguage` object. If the input value is not valid, it returns `UNKNOWN`. The `getLanguageCodeOf` method takes a `ThriftLanguage` object as input and returns the corresponding language code as a string. If the input is null, it returns null.

This class can be used in the larger project to convert between `ThriftLanguage` and `Locale` objects. For example, if the project needs to display text in a particular language, it can use the `getThriftLanguageOf` method to get the corresponding `ThriftLanguage` object and use it to set the language of the text. Similarly, if the project receives a `ThriftLanguage` object from an external source, it can use the `getLocaleOf` method to get the corresponding `Locale` object and use it to display text in the correct language.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to convert ThriftLanguage to Locale object and vice versa.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the following external libraries: Guava and SLF4J.

3. What potential issues or edge cases should be considered when using this code?
- One potential issue is that ThriftLanguage.findByValue() can return null, so the code needs to handle null correctly. Another issue is that multiple ThriftLanguage entries can return the same language code.
