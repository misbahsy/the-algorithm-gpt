The `TweetProcessingConfig` class is a configuration file for relevance computation in the Twitter search engine. It provides methods to initialize the configuration file, read properties from it, and return their values as different data types. 

The class has three `init()` methods that initialize the configuration file. The first method takes a file name as input and reads the configuration file from the file system. The second method takes an input stream and a configuration type as input and reads the configuration file from the input stream. The third method initializes the configuration file with the default file name.

The class provides five methods to read properties from the configuration file. Each method takes a property name and a default value as input and returns the value of the property as a different data type. The data types supported are double, string, integer, long, and boolean. If the property is not present in the configuration file, the method returns the default value.

The class also has a private constructor, which prevents the instantiation of the class. The class uses the singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the configuration file is created. The class uses lazy initialization to create the instance of the configuration file only when it is needed.

The `TweetProcessingConfig` class is used in the larger Twitter search engine project to provide configuration parameters for relevance computation. The class can be used to read configuration parameters from a file or an input stream, and the parameters can be used to compute relevance scores for tweets. 

Example usage:

```
// Initialize the configuration file
TweetProcessingConfig.init();

// Get the value of a property as a string
String propertyValue = TweetProcessingConfig.getString("property_name", "default_value");

// Get the value of a property as an integer
int propertyValue = TweetProcessingConfig.getInt("property_name", 0);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a configuration file for relevance computation in Twitter search.

2. What is the significance of the `relevance.yml` file?
- `relevance.yml` is the default configuration file for relevance computation. If no other configuration file is specified, this file will be used.

3. What is the purpose of the `init()` methods?
- The `init()` methods initialize the configuration file. There are three different `init()` methods: one that takes a file name, one that takes an input stream and a config type, and one that takes no arguments and uses the default configuration file.
