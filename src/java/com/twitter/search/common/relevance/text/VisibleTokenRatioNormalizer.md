The VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer class is a utility class that provides methods to normalize and denormalize a percentage value. This class is used to normalize the visible token ratio of a text, which is the ratio of visible tokens (words, hashtags, mentions, etc.) to the total number of tokens in the text. The purpose of normalizing this ratio is to map it to a fixed range of values, which can be used to compare the relevance of different texts.

The class has a constructor that takes an integer parameter normalizeToBits, which determines the size of the range to normalize the percentage value to. The size of the range is calculated as 2 to the power of normalizeToBits, minus 1. For example, if normalizeToBits is set to 4, the range size will be 15 (2^4 - 1).

The class has two main methods: normalize and denormalize. The normalize method takes a double value percent, which represents the percentage value to be normalized. The method first checks if the value is within the range of 0 to 1, and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it is not. Then, it calculates the bucket index by multiplying the percentage value by the range size and casting it to an integer. Finally, it returns the normalized value by subtracting the bucket index from the range size.

The denormalize method takes an integer value reverseBucket, which represents the normalized value to be denormalized. The method first calculates the bucket index by subtracting the reverseBucket value from the range size. Then, it returns the denormalized value by dividing the bucket index by the range size.

The class also has a static method createInstance, which creates a new instance of the class with a default normalizeToBits value of 4.

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer normalizer = VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer.createInstance();
double visibleTokenRatio = 0.75;
int normalizedValue = normalizer.normalize(visibleTokenRatio);
double denormalizedValue = normalizer.denormalize(normalizedValue);
System.out.println("Normalized value: " + normalizedValue);
System.out.println("Denormalized value: " + denormalizedValue);
```

This code creates a new instance of the VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer class, normalizes a visible token ratio value of 0.75, denormalizes the normalized value, and prints both values to the console. The output should be:

```
Normalized value: 3
Denormalized value: 0.8125
```

Overall, the VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer class provides a simple and flexible way to normalize and denormalize percentage values, which can be useful in various text relevance algorithms.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a class called `VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer` that has methods to normalize and denormalize a percentage value based on a given size.

2. What is the purpose of the `normalizeToBits` parameter in the constructor?
- The `normalizeToBits` parameter is used to calculate the size of the normalization range. It determines the number of bits to shift left by 1 and add 1 to get the size.

3. What is the significance of the `normalizeToSize` variable?
- The `normalizeToSize` variable represents the size of the normalization range. It is used to calculate the normalized value of a given percentage and to denormalize a normalized value back to its original percentage.
