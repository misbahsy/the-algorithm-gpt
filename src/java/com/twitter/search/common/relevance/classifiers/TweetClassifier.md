The TweetClassifier class is an interface that provides a way to perform feature classification for a single TwitterMessage object or a group of them. The classification process involves two steps: feature extraction and quality evaluation. During feature extraction, any interesting feature that is deemed useful for subsequent quality analysis is extracted from the TwitterMessage object. Quality evaluation is then done by a group of TweetEvaluator objects associated with the classifier, using the various features extracted in the previous step. Feature extraction and quality evaluation results are stored in the TweetFeatures field of the TwitterMessage object, which is defined in src/main/thrift/classifier.thrift.

The TweetClassifier class has several methods that allow for the classification of a single TwitterMessage object or a group of them. The classifyTweet method takes a TwitterMessage object as input, extracts its features, and evaluates its quality. The classifyTweets method takes a group of TwitterMessage objects as input, extracts their features, and evaluates their quality. The setQualityEvaluators method allows for the specification of a list of TweetQualityEvaluators to be used with the classifier. The extractFeatures method is an abstract method that must be implemented by concrete subclasses to extract interesting features from a single TwitterMessage object for classification. The extractFeatures method that takes an Iterable of TwitterMessage objects as input iterates through the list and calls the extractFeatures method for each individual tweet. The evaluate method takes a TwitterMessage object as input and performs quality evaluation on it using the specified TweetQualityEvaluators. The evaluate method that takes an Iterable of TwitterMessage objects as input iterates through the list and calls the evaluate method for each individual tweet.

Overall, the TweetClassifier class provides a way to classify TwitterMessage objects based on their features and quality, which can be useful in various applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and content recommendation. The class can be extended to implement specific classification algorithms and feature extraction methods. For example, a concrete subclass of TweetClassifier could implement a machine learning algorithm to classify tweets based on their content and metadata.
## Questions:
