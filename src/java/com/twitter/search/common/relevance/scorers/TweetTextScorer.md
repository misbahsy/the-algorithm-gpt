The `TweetTextScorer` class is responsible for computing a text score for a `TwitterMessage` based on its offensiveness, shoutness, length, readability, and hashtag properties extracted from tweet text. The formula used to calculate the text score is `text_score = offensive_text_damping * offensive_username_damping * Sigma(feature_score_weight * feature_score)`. The scored features are length, readability, shout, entropy, and links. 

The class contains several constants that define the default values for the weights and alpha values used in the formula. These values can be overridden by providing a configuration file. The class has two constructors, one that takes a configuration file and another that does not. 

The `scoreTweet` method takes a `TwitterMessage` object and computes the text score for it. The method first checks if the `TwitterMessage` object has the required features. If the features are present, the method computes the score using the formula mentioned above. The method also updates various statistics related to the score, such as the number of offensive texts, the number of offensive usernames, and the number of scored tweets. 

The `normalize` method is used to normalize the passed-in value to a smoothed [0, 1.0d] range. The `checkWeightRange` method is used to ensure that the weight values are within the range of [0.0, 1.0]. 

Overall, the `TweetTextScorer` class is an important component of the larger project that aims to provide relevance scores for tweets. The class is responsible for computing the text score for a tweet based on various features. The text score is an important metric that is used to determine the relevance of a tweet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code computes a text score for a Twitter message based on its offensiveness, shoutness, length, readability, and hashtag properties extracted from tweet text.

2. What are the different weights used in the formula for computing the text score?
- The different weights used in the formula are length weight, readability weight, shout weight, entropy weight, and link weight.

3. What is the significance of the different alpha values used in the normalization process?
- The different alpha values are used to normalize the passed-in value to a smoothed [0, 1.0d] range. They control the steepness of the sigmoid function used in the normalization process.
