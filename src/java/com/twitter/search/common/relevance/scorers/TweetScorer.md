The TweetScorer class is an interface that provides methods to compute feature scores for a single TwitterMessage object or a group of them. The purpose of this class is to separate the scoring logic from the classification logic, which may be run at different stages and in different batching manners. 

The scoreTweet method takes a TwitterMessage object and computes and stores the feature score in it based on its TweetFeatures. The scoreTweets method takes an Iterable of TwitterMessage objects and scores each individual tweet. This method is intended to be overridden by concrete subclasses to implement batching for better performance.

The classifyAndScoreTweet method is a convenience method that takes a TweetClassifier object and a TwitterMessage object, classifies the tweet using the specified list of classifiers, and then computes the score. The classifyAndScoreTweets method is similar, but takes an Iterable of TwitterMessage objects instead.

Overall, the TweetScorer class provides a framework for computing feature scores for TwitterMessage objects, with the flexibility to run classification and scoring separately or together. This class can be used in the larger project to score tweets based on their features and classify them using a list of classifiers. 

Example usage:

```
// create a TweetScorer object
TweetScorer scorer = new MyTweetScorer();

// score a single tweet
TwitterMessage tweet = new TwitterMessage();
scorer.scoreTweet(tweet);

// score a group of tweets
List<TwitterMessage> tweets = getTweets();
scorer.scoreTweets(tweets);

// classify and score a single tweet
TweetClassifier classifier = new MyTweetClassifier();
scorer.classifyAndScoreTweet(classifier, tweet);

// classify and score a group of tweets
scorer.classifyAndScoreTweets(classifier, tweets);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface for computing feature scores for Twitter messages based on their corresponding TweetFeatures, and provides convenience methods for running classification and scoring in one call.

2. What is the difference between TweetScorer and TweetClassifier?
- TweetScorer computes feature scores for Twitter messages, while TweetClassifier classifies Twitter messages based on their corresponding TweetFeatures.

3. Can the scoreTweets method be overridden by subclasses?
- Yes, the scoreTweets method can be overridden by subclasses to implement batching for better performance.
