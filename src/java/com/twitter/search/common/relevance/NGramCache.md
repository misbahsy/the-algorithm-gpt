The `NGramCache` class is a cache for trends. It provides methods to extract trends from a list of normalized tokens, a list of tokens, or a given `CharSequence`. The cache is implemented using a `Map` where the keys are trends and the values are empty strings. The cache is built using the `CacheBuilder` class from the Guava library. The cache has a maximum size of 5000 items and a default time-to-live (TTL) of 24 hours. The TTL can be customized using the `Builder` class. The cache is thread-safe and uses a single refresher thread that writes to the cache.

The `NGramCache` class has several public methods that can be used to extract trends from a given input. The `extractTrendsFromNormalized` method takes a list of normalized tokens and returns a list of trends that match the tokens. The `extractTrendsFrom` method takes a list of tokens and a `Locale` and returns a list of trends that match the tokens and the locale. The `extractTrendsFrom` method that takes a `CharSequence` and a `Locale` works similarly. All of these methods return an empty list if there are no trends that match the input.

The `NGramCache` class also has several utility methods. The `numTrendingTerms` method returns the number of trends in the cache. The `getTrends` method returns a set of all the trends in the cache. The `clear` method clears the cache and resets the trends matcher to `null`. The `addAll` method adds all the trends in an iterable to the cache and updates the trends matcher accordingly.

The `NGramCache` class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It is likely used to extract trends from text data in real-time. The cache is used to speed up the trend extraction process by avoiding redundant computations. The cache is also used to limit the memory usage of the trend extraction process by evicting old trends from the cache. The `NGramCache` class can be used by other classes in the project that need to extract trends from text data. For example, it could be used by a class that processes tweets to extract the most popular hashtags. 

Example usage:

```
NGramCache cache = NGramCache.builder().build();
List<String> tokens = Arrays.asList("hello", "world", "twitter");
List<String> trends = cache.extractTrendsFrom(tokens, Locale.ENGLISH);
System.out.println(trends); // []
cache.addAll(Arrays.asList("twitter", "world"));
trends = cache.extractTrendsFrom(tokens, Locale.ENGLISH);
System.out.println(trends); // [world, twitter]
```
