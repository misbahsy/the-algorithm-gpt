The code defines two byte value normalizers that are used to push feature values into the earlybird database. The first normalizer, `BYTE_NORMALIZER`, is a `SingleBytePositiveFloatNormalizer` that converts a byte value into a positive float value between 0 and 1. The second normalizer, `SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER`, is a `SmartIntegerNormalizer` that converts a byte value into an integer value between 0 and 255, with the ability to handle values up to 50 million. 

The purpose of these normalizers is to transform feature values into a format that can be easily stored and queried in the earlybird database. The `BYTE_NORMALIZER` is useful for features that have a small range of values, while the `SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER` is useful for features that have a larger range of values. 

For example, if we have a feature that represents the number of retweets a tweet has received, we could use the `SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER` to convert the byte value into an integer value between 0 and 255. This would allow us to easily query the database for tweets with a certain number of retweets, without having to store the actual retweet count for each tweet. 

Overall, the `MutableFeatureNormalizers` class provides a useful set of tools for normalizing feature values in the earlybird database. By using these normalizers, we can store and query feature values more efficiently, which can improve the performance of our search algorithms.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines two byte value normalizers used to push feature values into earlybird db.

2. What is the difference between BYTE_NORMALIZER and SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER?
- BYTE_NORMALIZER is not recommended for processing any new data and should be avoided. SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER is preferred and has a maximum counter value supported of 50,000,000.

3. What is the significance of the parameters passed to SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER?
- The first parameter is the maximum counter value supported, which is set to 50,000,000. The second parameter is the number of bits used to represent the value, which is set to 8.
