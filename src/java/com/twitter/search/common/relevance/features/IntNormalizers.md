The `IntNormalizers` class provides a set of static methods that normalize integer feature values for use in the earlybird database. The purpose of this class is to ensure that feature values are within the expected range and format for efficient storage and retrieval. 

The class contains several static final fields, each of which is an instance of the `IntNormalizer` functional interface. This interface defines a single method that takes an integer value and returns a normalized integer value. 

The `LEGACY_NORMALIZER` and `SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER` fields wrap the `ByteNormalizer` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.encoding.features` package. These fields are used to normalize 8-bit feature types. The `PARUS_SCORE_NORMALIZER` field is used to set the deprecated `PARUS_SCORE` feature to 0. The `BOOLEAN_NORMALIZER` field converts a boolean value to an integer value (0 or 1). The `TIMESTAMP_SEC_TO_HR_NORMALIZER` field converts a timestamp value from seconds to hours. Finally, the `PREDICTION_SCORE_NORMALIZER` field is an instance of the `PredictionScoreNormalizer` class, which normalizes prediction scores to a range between 0 and 1. 

These normalizers are used in other classes throughout the project to ensure that feature values are properly formatted before being stored in the earlybird database. For example, the `FeatureEncoder` class uses these normalizers to encode feature values as byte arrays for storage in the database. 

Example usage of the `BOOLEAN_NORMALIZER` field:
```
int featureValue = someBoolean ? 1 : 0;
int normalizedValue = IntNormalizers.BOOLEAN_NORMALIZER.normalize(featureValue);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a set of Int value normalizers used to push feature values into earlybird db for the Twitter search engine.

2. What is the significance of the PARUS_SCORE_NORMALIZER?
    
    The PARUS_SCORE feature is deprecated and is never set in the indexes, but some models do not work properly with "missing" features, so the PARUS_SCORE_NORMALIZER sets the PARUS_SCORE feature to 0.

3. What is the purpose of the PredictionScoreNormalizer?
    
    The PredictionScoreNormalizer is used to normalize prediction scores to a range of 0 to 1, with a specified number of decimal places. In this case, it is set to 3 decimal places.
