This code defines an enum called `QueryFeatureType` which is used to hold different types of query-specific features. The two features currently defined in this enum are `SOCIAL_ENGAGEMENTS` and `CLICKS`. 

In the larger project, this enum may be used to specify which type of query-specific feature to use when performing a search. For example, if the search algorithm is designed to take into account social engagements (such as likes, shares, and comments) when ranking search results, the `SOCIAL_ENGAGEMENTS` feature may be specified in the search query. Similarly, if the algorithm is designed to prioritize search results based on the number of clicks they receive, the `CLICKS` feature may be specified.

This enum is not indexed in Earlybird, which suggests that Earlybird is a search indexing system used in the project. The fact that these query-specific features are not indexed suggests that they are not used as part of the search index, but rather as additional parameters to the search algorithm.

Here is an example of how this enum may be used in a search query:

```
SearchQuery query = new SearchQuery();
query.setQueryFeature(QueryFeatureType.SOCIAL_ENGAGEMENTS);
query.setKeywords("Twitter");
SearchResults results = searchService.search(query);
``` 

In this example, a new `SearchQuery` object is created and the `setQueryFeature` method is used to specify that the search should take into account social engagements. The `setKeywords` method is used to specify the search term ("Twitter"), and the `search` method is called on the `searchService` object to perform the search. The `SearchResults` object returned by the `search` method contains the search results, which can be further processed or displayed to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this enum and how is it used in the project?
   - This enum is used to hold different types of query-specific features that are not indexed in Earlybird. It is likely used in the relevance features module of the project to define and categorize different types of query features.
2. Are there any other query-specific features that are indexed in Earlybird?
   - It is not clear from this code whether there are other query-specific features that are indexed in Earlybird. Further investigation into the project's codebase or documentation may be necessary to answer this question.
3. How are the values of this enum used in the project's code?
   - Without additional context, it is unclear how the values of this enum are used in the project's code. It is possible that they are used as parameters in methods or as properties of other classes. Further investigation into the project's codebase or documentation may be necessary to answer this question.
