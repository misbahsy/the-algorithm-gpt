The `TweetFeatureType` enum in this code represents various dynamic/real-time features related to tweets that can be updated in the Signal Ingester. These features are used to analyze and rank tweets based on their relevance and engagement. The enum provides information for normalization and corresponding earlybird feature fields, and it includes utility methods for both producer (Signal Ingester) and consumer (Earlybird) sides.

The features include different types of engagement counters such as retweets, replies, favorites, quotes, and their weighted and decayed versions. Additionally, it includes tweet-level safety labels like abusive, spam, and NSFW flags, as well as Periscope-related features.

Normalization is performed using different `IntNormalizer` instances, such as `LEGACY_NORMALIZER`, `SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER`, `PARUS_SCORE_NORMALIZER`, `BOOLEAN_NORMALIZER`, and `TIMESTAMP_SEC_TO_HR_NORMALIZER`. These normalizers help in standardizing the feature values for further processing.

The code also provides mappings for v2 counters, weighted counters, decayed counters, and elapsed time features. Utility methods like `getV2Type()`, `getWeightedType()`, `getDecayedType()`, and `getElapsedTimeFeatureType()` are provided to fetch the corresponding mapped feature types.

The `IncrementChecker` class is used to check if a value change is eligible for output based on the normalization of old and new values. This helps in filtering out insignificant changes in feature values.

Overall, this code plays a crucial role in processing and analyzing tweet features for the larger project, helping to rank and filter tweets based on their relevance and engagement.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetFeatureType` enum and how is it used in the context of the project?
   **Answer**: The `TweetFeatureType` enum represents all dynamic/realtime feature types that can be updated in the Signal Ingester. It provides information for their normalization and their corresponding earlybird feature fields, and provides utilities for both producer (Signal Ingester) and consumer (Earlybird) side.

2. **Question**: What are the different normalizers used in the `TweetFeatureType` enum, and what is their purpose?
   **Answer**: The different normalizers used in the `TweetFeatureType` enum are `LEGACY_NORMALIZER`, `PARUS_SCORE_NORMALIZER`, `SMART_INTEGER_NORMALIZER`, `BOOLEAN_NORMALIZER`, and `TIMESTAMP_SEC_TO_HR_NORMALIZER`. Their purpose is to normalize the output values and check value changes for the respective feature types.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `IncrementChecker` class and how is it used in the context of the `TweetFeatureType` enum?
   **Answer**: The `IncrementChecker` class is used to check if an increment is eligible for emitting. It takes a `TweetFeatureType` as input and uses its normalizer to determine if a value change is eligible for output based on the difference between the normalized old and new values.
