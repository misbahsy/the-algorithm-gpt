The `RelevanceSignalConstants` class defines constants related to relevance signals that are used during both ingestion and scoring of tweets in the larger project. The class contains two sets of constants: one related to user reputation and the other related to text score.

The user reputation constants include `UNSET_REPUTATION_SENTINEL`, `MAX_REPUTATION`, `MIN_REPUTATION`, and `GOODWILL_REPUTATION`. `UNSET_REPUTATION_SENTINEL` is a byte value that represents an unset user reputation. `MAX_REPUTATION` and `MIN_REPUTATION` represent the maximum and minimum possible user reputation values, respectively. `GOODWILL_REPUTATION` is a byte value that represents a default goodwill value for new users whose reputation is unset. These constants are used to check whether a given user reputation value is valid using the `isValidUserReputation` method.

The text score constants include `UNSET_TEXT_SCORE_SENTINEL` and `GOODWILL_TEXT_SCORE`. `UNSET_TEXT_SCORE_SENTINEL` is a byte value that represents an unset text score. `GOODWILL_TEXT_SCORE` is a byte value that represents a default goodwill value for text score in case it is unset.

Overall, this class provides a centralized location for defining and managing relevance signal constants used throughout the project. Other classes and methods in the project can reference these constants as needed. For example, the `isValidUserReputation` method can be used to validate user reputation values before they are used in scoring algorithms. 

Example usage of `isValidUserReputation` method:
```
int userRep = 50;
if (RelevanceSignalConstants.isValidUserReputation(userRep)) {
  // use userRep in scoring algorithm
} else {
  // handle invalid userRep value
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
    
    This class defines constants related to relevance signals used during ingestion and scoring time for a Twitter search feature.

2. What are the possible values for user reputation and text score?
    
    User reputation can range from 0 to 100, with a default goodwill value of 17 for new users. Text score has a default goodwill value of 19. Both values can also be unset, indicated by a sentinel value of Byte.MIN_VALUE.

3. How is user reputation validated?
    
    User reputation is considered valid if it is not unset (Byte.MIN_VALUE) and falls within the range of 0 to 100.
