The TweetIntegerShingleSignature class is used to represent a signature of a status text sample. The signature is a byte array of length 4, where each byte represents the signature of a status text sample. The byte array is sorted in ascending order and then compacted into an integer in big endian order for serialization. 

The class provides several constructors to create a TweetIntegerShingleSignature object from a byte array or a serialized integer signature. It also provides a constructor that takes an Iterable of byte arrays to generate a signature. 

The class provides a method to perform fuzzy matching between two TweetIntegerShingleSignature objects. Fuzzy matching is met when the number of matching bytes between the two is equal to or above 3. The class also provides a method to check if two signatures are fuzzy matches. 

The class provides methods to get the sorted array of signature bytes and to serialize the signature into an integer. It also provides a method to deserialize an integer into a byte array. 

The class overrides the equals() and hashCode() methods to perform fuzzy matching and to optimize the hash code calculation for fast pass for majority case of no fuzzy matching. 

The class provides constants for the number of shingles, the default no signature value, the default minimum shingles match value, and a NO_SIGNATURE_HANDLE object. 

The high-level purpose of this class is to provide a way to represent and compare signatures of status text samples. It is used in the larger project to perform fuzzy matching between status text samples to detect duplicates. 

Example usage:
```
byte[] shingles = {1, 2, 3, 4};
TweetIntegerShingleSignature signature = new TweetIntegerShingleSignature(shingles);
int serializedSignature = signature.serialize();
TweetIntegerShingleSignature deserializedSignature = TweetIntegerShingleSignature.deserialize(serializedSignature);
boolean isFuzzyMatch = TweetIntegerShingleSignature.isFuzzyMatch(serializedSignature, deserializedSignature.serialize());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the TweetIntegerShingleSignature class?
- The TweetIntegerShingleSignature class represents a signature of a status text sample and is used for fuzzy matching between two TweetIntegerShingleSignature objects.

2. What is the significance of the minShinglesMatch field?
- The minShinglesMatch field specifies the minimum number of matching bytes required for two TweetIntegerShingleSignature objects to be considered a fuzzy match.

3. What is the purpose of the serializeInternal and deserializeInternal methods?
- The serializeInternal method is used to serialize 4 sorted signature bytes into an integer in big endian order, while the deserializeInternal method is used to deserialize an integer into a 4-byte array.
