The AgeDecay class is a utility class that computes an age decay multiplier based on a sigmoid function. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to compute the age decay of a tweet, which is used to determine the relevance of a tweet in a search result. The age decay multiplier is computed based on the age of the tweet and the halflife of the decay function.

The AgeDecay class has several methods that can be used to compute the age decay multiplier. The getAgeDecayMultiplier method takes the tweet age and the unit of the tweet age as parameters and returns the age decay multiplier. The compute method takes the age of the tweet as a parameter and returns the age decay multiplier. The computeExponential method computes the age decay multiplier using an exponential decay function.

The AgeDecay class has several constructors that can be used to create an AgeDecay object. The constructor takes the base, maxBoost, halflife, and slope as parameters. The base is the base value of the decay function, maxBoost is the maximum boost value of the decay function, halflife is the halflife of the decay function, and slope is the slope of the decay function. The constructor with three parameters takes the base, halflife, and slope as parameters and sets the maxBoost to 1.0.

The AgeDecay class also has a compute method that takes all the parameters as arguments and returns the age decay multiplier. This method can be used if an AgeDecay object does not need to be reused.

Overall, the AgeDecay class provides a way to compute the age decay of a tweet, which is used to determine the relevance of a tweet in a search result. The class can be used in the larger project to improve the search results by taking into account the age of the tweets. Below is an example of how to use the AgeDecay class to compute the age decay multiplier:

```
AgeDecay ageDecay = new AgeDecay(0.0, 1.0, 60.0, 4.0);
double ageDecayMultiplier = ageDecay.getAgeDecayMultiplier(3600, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a utility to compute an age decay multiplier based on a sigmoid function.

2. What are the input parameters for the `AgeDecay` constructor?
- The `AgeDecay` constructor takes in four parameters: `base`, `maxBoost`, `halflife`, and `slope`.

3. What is the difference between the `compute` method and the `computeExponential` method?
- The `compute` method computes the age decay using a sigmoid function, while the `computeExponential` method computes the age decay using an exponential decay function. The latter also has an additional parameter for remapping the value from a range of (0,1] to (min,max].
