The `TweetUserFeatures` class is a Java class that defines a set of features that can be associated with a tweet user. These features include the user's language, the confidence level of the language detection, the number of followers and following, the user's reputation, the number of tweets, retweets, and retweeted tweets, the topics the user is known for, and whether the user is spam, NSFW, or a bot.

This class can be used in the larger project to extract and analyze features of tweet users. For example, the `getFollowers()` method can be used to retrieve the number of followers for a given tweet user, which can be used to determine the user's popularity. Similarly, the `getKnownForTopics()` method can be used to retrieve the topics the user is known for, which can be used to determine the user's areas of expertise.

The class also provides setter methods for each feature, allowing the features to be set for a given tweet user. For example, the `setLang()` method can be used to set the language of a tweet user, and the `setSpam()` method can be used to set whether a tweet user is spam.

Overall, the `TweetUserFeatures` class provides a set of features that can be used to analyze tweet users and extract insights from their behavior.
## Questions:
