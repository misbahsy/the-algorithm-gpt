The `TermVector` class is used to represent a vector of terms and their corresponding weights. It provides methods to calculate the magnitude, dot product, and cosine similarity of two term vectors. 

The constructor takes a `Map` of term weights and calculates the magnitude of the vector. The `getTermWeights` method returns an immutable copy of the original `Map` of term weights. The `getMagnitude` method returns the magnitude of the vector.

The `getUnitNormalized` method returns a new `TermVector` instance that is normalized to have a magnitude of 1. If the magnitude of the original vector is very low (less than `MIN_MAGNITUDE`), it returns `null`. This method uses the `Maps.transformValues` method from the Guava library to apply a function that divides each weight by the magnitude of the vector.

The `getDotProduct` method takes another `TermVector` instance as a parameter and calculates the dot product of the two vectors. It iterates over the term weights of the first vector and multiplies each weight by the corresponding weight in the second vector. If a term is not present in the second vector, its weight is treated as 0.

The `getCosineSimilarity` method takes another `TermVector` instance as a parameter and calculates the cosine similarity of the two vectors. It first checks if either vector has a very small magnitude (less than `MIN_MAGNITUDE`) and returns 0 if so. Otherwise, it calculates the dot product of the two vectors and divides it by the product of their magnitudes.

This class can be used in a larger project that involves text analysis or natural language processing. For example, it could be used to represent the term vectors of documents and calculate their similarity. It could also be used to represent the term vectors of queries and documents and rank the documents based on their relevance to the query. 

Example usage:

```
Map<String, Double> termWeights1 = ImmutableMap.of("foo", 0.5, "bar", 0.3, "baz", 0.2);
TermVector vector1 = new TermVector(termWeights1);

Map<String, Double> termWeights2 = ImmutableMap.of("foo", 0.4, "bar", 0.4, "qux", 0.2);
TermVector vector2 = new TermVector(termWeights2);

double dotProduct = vector1.getDotProduct(vector2);
double cosineSimilarity = vector1.getCosineSimilarity(vector2);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
- This class is used to keep String-Double of term vectors and can calculate magnitude, dot product, and cosine similarity.

2. What is the significance of the MIN_MAGNITUDE constant?
- The MIN_MAGNITUDE constant is used to check if the magnitude of the term vector is very low. If it is, the getUnitNormalized() method will return null.

3. What is the purpose of the getUnitNormalized() method?
- The getUnitNormalized() method is used to normalize the term vector into unit magnitude and return the unit normalized TermVector with magnitude equals 1. If the magnitude is very low, it returns null.
