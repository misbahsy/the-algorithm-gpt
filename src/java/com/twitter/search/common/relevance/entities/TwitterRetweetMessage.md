The `TwitterRetweetMessage` class is a Java class that represents a retweet message on Twitter. It contains fields that store information about the original tweet that was retweeted, as well as the retweet itself. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to encapsulate and manipulate this information in a structured way.

The `TwitterRetweetMessage` class has several fields that store information about the original tweet that was retweeted. These include the `sharedId`, which is the ID of the original tweet, the `sharedUserDisplayName`, which is the display name of the user who posted the original tweet, and the `sharedUserTwitterId`, which is the Twitter ID of the user who posted the original tweet. The `sharedDate` field stores the date and time when the original tweet was posted.

The class also has a field called `retweetId`, which stores the ID of the retweet itself. This field is used to distinguish the retweet from the original tweet.

The class provides getter and setter methods for each of these fields, allowing other parts of the code to access and modify the information stored in the `TwitterRetweetMessage` object.

In addition, the class overrides the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods from the `Object` class. This allows instances of the `TwitterRetweetMessage` class to be compared for equality, hashed, and converted to a string representation.

Overall, the `TwitterRetweetMessage` class is a useful component of the larger project that deals with Twitter data. It provides a way to represent and manipulate retweet messages in a structured way, which can be used by other parts of the project to perform various tasks, such as analyzing retweet patterns or generating statistics on retweets. Here is an example of how the `TwitterRetweetMessage` class might be used in the larger project:

```
TwitterRetweetMessage retweet = new TwitterRetweetMessage();
retweet.setSharedId(123456789);
retweet.setSharedUserDisplayName("JohnDoe");
retweet.setSharedUserTwitterId(987654321);
retweet.setSharedDate(new Date());
retweet.setRetweetId(987654321);

// Do something with the retweet object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
- This class represents a retweet message on Twitter and contains information about the original tweet and the retweet.

2. What is the significance of the TwitterMessageUtil class mentioned in the comments?
- It is unclear from this code what the TwitterMessageUtil class does, but it is mentioned in the comments as being responsible for checking some of the fields in this class.

3. Why are the equals, hashCode, and toString methods overridden?
- These methods are overridden to provide custom implementations that use reflection to compare and generate hash codes and string representations of the object's fields. This can be useful for debugging and testing purposes.
