The `TwitterQuotedMessage` class is a simple Java object that represents a quoted message on Twitter. It has two fields, `quotedStatusId` and `quotedUserId`, which are the IDs of the status and user being quoted, respectively. The class has a constructor that takes these two IDs as arguments and sets them as the values of the corresponding fields. It also has getter methods for both fields.

This class is likely used in the larger project to represent quoted messages in Twitter search results. When a user searches for tweets on Twitter, the search results may include tweets that quote other tweets. The `TwitterQuotedMessage` class can be used to represent these quoted tweets in the search results. For example, the search results may include a list of `TwitterQuotedMessage` objects, each of which represents a quoted tweet. The `quotedStatusId` field can be used to retrieve the ID of the quoted tweet, which can then be used to fetch more information about the tweet, such as its text, author, and creation time.

The class also overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods from the `Object` class. These methods are commonly used in Java to compare objects for equality, generate hash codes for objects, and create string representations of objects, respectively. By overriding these methods, the `TwitterQuotedMessage` class can be used more easily in collections and other contexts where object comparison and string representation are important. For example, if a list of `TwitterQuotedMessage` objects needs to be sorted or searched, the `equals` and `hashCode` methods can be used to compare the objects, and the `toString` method can be used to display the objects in a user-friendly format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
- This class represents a quoted message object in Twitter search and contains the quoted status ID and user ID.

2. What is the significance of using the Apache Commons Lang library?
- The Apache Commons Lang library is used for generating the equals, hashCode, and toString methods in a concise and consistent manner.

3. Are there any other methods or properties that could be added to this class to enhance its functionality?
- Depending on the requirements of the project, additional methods or properties could be added to this class, such as a method to retrieve the full quoted message text or a property to indicate whether the quoted message is a retweet.
