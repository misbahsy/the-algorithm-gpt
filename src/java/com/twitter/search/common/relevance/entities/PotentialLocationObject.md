The `PotentialLocationObject` class is a Java class that represents a tuple of three strings: a country code, a region, and a locality. This class is used to wrap the `PotentialLocation` struct in `status.thrift`. The class is immutable, meaning that its state cannot be changed after it is created. 

The `PotentialLocationObject` class has three fields: `countryCode`, `region`, and `locality`. These fields are set in the constructor of the class and can be accessed using getter methods. 

The class also has a method called `toThriftPotentialLocation` that converts an instance of `PotentialLocationObject` to an instance of `PotentialLocation` struct in `status.thrift`. This method takes a `PenguinVersion` object as an argument, which is used for normalization and tokenization. The method normalizes the country code, region, and locality strings using the `NormalizerHelper` class and tokenizes the region and locality strings using the `TokenizerHelper` class. The method then returns an instance of `PotentialLocation` struct with the normalized and tokenized strings. 

The `PotentialLocationObject` class overrides the `hashCode`, `equals`, and `toString` methods. The `hashCode` method returns a hash code value for the object based on the hash codes of its fields. The `equals` method compares two objects for equality based on the equality of their fields. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object. 

This class is used in the larger project to represent a potential location of a tweet. The `PotentialLocationObject` class is used to wrap the `PotentialLocation` struct in `status.thrift`, which is used to store the potential location of a tweet. The `toThriftPotentialLocation` method is used to convert an instance of `PotentialLocationObject` to an instance of `PotentialLocation` struct in `status.thrift`. This conversion is necessary because the `PotentialLocation` struct is used in other parts of the project to store the potential location of a tweet. 

Example usage:

```java
PotentialLocationObject location = new PotentialLocationObject("US", "California", "San Francisco");
PenguinVersion penguinVersion = new PenguinVersion("1.0.0");
PotentialLocation potentialLocation = location.toThriftPotentialLocation(penguinVersion);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the PotentialLocationObject class?
- The PotentialLocationObject class is an immutable tuple that wraps a country code, region, and locality, and is used to create a PotentialLocation thrift struct.

2. What is the purpose of the toThriftPotentialLocation method?
- The toThriftPotentialLocation method converts a PotentialLocationObject instance to a PotentialLocation thrift struct, using a specified penguin version for normalization and tokenization.

3. What are the LanguageIdentifierHelper, NormalizerHelper, and TokenizerHelper classes used for?
- These classes are used to identify the language of a string, normalize it, and tokenize it, respectively, in order to prepare the region and locality strings for use in the PotentialLocation thrift struct.
