The `GeoObject` class is a representation of a geographical object that extends a `GeoCoordinate` to include radius and accuracy. It is used to create a `ThriftGeoTags` instance, which is used to tag tweets with location information. 

The class has three constructors, one that takes in latitude, longitude, and a `ThriftGeoLocationSource` object, another that takes in latitude, longitude, accuracy, and a `ThriftGeoLocationSource` object, and a third that takes in only a `ThriftGeoLocationSource` object. The class also has getter and setter methods for latitude, longitude, radius, and accuracy. 

The `fromPlace` method tries to create a `GeoObject` instance from a given TweetyPie `Place` struct based on its bounding box coordinates. If the bounding box coordinates are available, it returns an `Optional` instance with a `GeoObject`, otherwise, it returns an empty `Optional`. 

The `toThriftGeoTags` method converts a `GeoObject` instance to a `ThriftGeoTags` instance. It sets the `latitude`, `longitude`, `accuracy`, and `geoLocationSource` fields of the `ThriftGeoTags` instance to the corresponding fields of the `GeoObject` instance. 

The `createForIngester` method is a convenience factory method for ingester purposes. It creates a `GeoObject` instance with the highest level of accuracy and a `ThriftGeoLocationSource` of `GEOTAG`. 

The `approxEquals` method performs an approximate comparison between two `GeoObject` instances. It is deprecated and should only be used for tests. 

Overall, the `GeoObject` class is an important part of the larger project as it is used to tag tweets with location information. It provides a convenient way to represent geographical objects and convert them to `ThriftGeoTags` instances.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the GeoObject class?
- The GeoObject class extends a GeoCoordinate to include radius and accuracy, and provides methods for creating and converting GeoObject instances.

2. What is the significance of the INT_FIELD_NOT_PRESENT and DOUBLE_FIELD_NOT_PRESENT constants?
- These constants are used to represent missing or invalid values for integer and double fields, respectively.

3. What is the purpose of the fromPlace method?
- The fromPlace method tries to create a GeoObject instance from a given TweetyPie Place struct based on its bounding box coordinates, and returns an Optional instance with GeoObject if bounding box coordinates are available, or an empty Optional.
