The `TrendsThriftDataServiceManager` class manages trends data retrieved from trends thrift API and performs automatic refresh. It is responsible for fetching available woeids and corresponding trending terms, and populating the cache with the received data. The class uses the `TrendsMetadataService` and `TrendingContentService` services to fetch the data. 

The class has a constructor that takes in several parameters, including the `serviceIdentifier`, `numRetries`, `requestTimeoutMS`, `initTrendsCacheDelay`, `reloadInterval`, and `trendsCacheList`. The `serviceIdentifier` is the service that wants to call into Trend's services. The `numRetries` is the number of retries in the event of request failures. The `requestTimeoutMS` is the amount of time the class waits before it considers a request as failed. The `initTrendsCacheDelay` is how long the class waits before the initial filling of the Trends cache in milliseconds. The `reloadInterval` is how often the class refreshes the cache with updated trends. The `trendsCacheList` is the cache of trends. 

The class has two methods, `startAutoRefresh()` and `stopAutoRefresh()`, that respectively start and stop the automatic refresh of the cache. The `shutDown()` method shuts down the manager and clears the cache. 

The class has an inner class, `TrendsUpdater`, that fetches available woeids and corresponding trending terms. The `populateCacheFromTrendsService()` method fetches the woeids and calls the `populateCacheFromTrendLocations()` method to populate the cache with the received data. The `populateCacheFromTrendLocations()` method makes a `TrendsPlusRequest` for each location and calls the `populateCacheFromResponses()` method to populate the cache with the received data. The `populateCacheFromResponses()` method adds the received trends to the cache. 

The class has several counters that keep track of the number of successful and failed requests. The class logs the refresh status after each refresh. 

Overall, the `TrendsThriftDataServiceManager` class manages the trends data and automatically refreshes the cache with updated trends. It uses the `TrendsMetadataService` and `TrendingContentService` services to fetch the data and populates the cache with the received data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code manages trends data retrieved from trends thrift API and performs automatic refresh.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as Guava, Finagle, and SLF4J.

3. What is the role of the TrendsUpdater class?
- The TrendsUpdater class is responsible for fetching available woeids and corresponding trending terms, and populating the cache from the responses. It is executed periodically by a scheduler.
