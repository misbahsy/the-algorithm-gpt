This code defines an interface called `ImmutableSchemaInterface` that extends another interface called `Schema`. The purpose of this interface is to provide a version of the `Schema` interface that is immutable, meaning that it cannot be changed once it is created. This is useful for short sessions, such as search query sessions, where the schema should not change during the session.

The `ImmutableSchemaInterface` interface is marked with the `@Immutable` and `@ThreadSafe` annotations, indicating that it is immutable and can be safely accessed by multiple threads at the same time.

This interface is likely used in the larger project to provide a way to define a schema that cannot be changed during a search query session. This can help ensure that the search results are consistent and accurate throughout the session.

Here is an example of how this interface might be used in code:

```
ImmutableSchemaInterface schema = new MyImmutableSchema();
SearchQuery query = new SearchQuery("twitter");
SearchResults results = performSearch(query, schema);
```

In this example, a new instance of a class that implements the `ImmutableSchemaInterface` interface is created and assigned to the `schema` variable. This schema is then passed to a `performSearch` method along with a search query. The `performSearch` method uses the schema to perform the search and returns the results. Because the schema is immutable, it cannot be changed during the search query session, ensuring that the search results are consistent and accurate.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code defines an interface called ImmutableSchemaInterface that extends another interface called Schema. It is used for short sessions where the schema should not change, such as a search query session.

2. What is the difference between ImmutableSchemaInterface and Schema?
- The only difference is that ImmutableSchemaInterface is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created, while Schema does not have this guarantee.

3. Are there any potential issues with using this interface in a multi-threaded environment?
- No, there should not be any issues as the interface is marked as both @Immutable and @ThreadSafe, indicating that it is safe to use in a multi-threaded environment. However, the implementation of the interface may still need to be checked for thread safety.
