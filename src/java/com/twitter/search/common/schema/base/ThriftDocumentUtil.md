The `ThriftDocumentUtil` class provides utility APIs for working with `ThriftDocument` objects. `ThriftDocument` is a Java class that represents a document in the Thrift schema, which is a protocol for serializing and deserializing structured data. The purpose of this class is to provide methods for retrieving field values from a `ThriftDocument` object.

The class contains several static methods that take a `ThriftDocument` object, a field name, and a `FieldNameToIdMapping` object as input parameters. The `FieldNameToIdMapping` object is used to map field names to field IDs, which are unique identifiers for fields in the Thrift schema. The methods then search the `ThriftDocument` object for fields that match the given field name and return the corresponding field value.

For example, the `getStringValue` method retrieves the string value of a field with the given name from a `ThriftDocument` object. If the field is not found, it returns `null`. Here is an example usage of this method:

```
ThriftDocument doc = ... // create a ThriftDocument object
FieldNameToIdMapping mapping = ... // create a FieldNameToIdMapping object
String value = ThriftDocumentUtil.getStringValue(doc, "myField", mapping);
```

The class also provides methods for retrieving fields by ID, checking for duplicate fields, and retrieving multiple string values for a given field name.

Overall, the `ThriftDocumentUtil` class provides a convenient set of utility methods for working with `ThriftDocument` objects in the context of the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility APIs for working with ThriftDocument objects.

2. What are some examples of tasks that can be accomplished using this code?
- This code can be used to retrieve specific field values from a ThriftDocument, check for duplicate fields, and get all fields that match a given field name.

3. What is the significance of the FieldNameToIdMapping parameter in some of the methods?
- The FieldNameToIdMapping parameter is used to map field names to field IDs, which are used to identify fields within a ThriftDocument. This allows the methods to retrieve the correct field based on its name.
