The `FieldNameToIdMapping` class is a part of the Twitter search project and is responsible for mapping field names to their corresponding IDs. This class is an abstract class that provides two methods: `getFieldID` and `newFieldNameToIdMapping`.

The `getFieldID` method takes a `fieldName` as input and returns the corresponding field ID. If the `fieldName` is not known to Earlybird, an unchecked exception is thrown. This method is abstract, which means that it must be implemented by any class that extends `FieldNameToIdMapping`.

The `newFieldNameToIdMapping` method takes a `Map` object that maps field names to their corresponding IDs and returns a new instance of `FieldNameToIdMapping`. This method creates an immutable copy of the input map using the `ImmutableMap.copyOf` method and returns a new instance of `FieldNameToIdMapping` that overrides the `getFieldID` method to use the immutable map to look up the field ID.

This class is used in the larger Twitter search project to provide a consistent way of mapping field names to their corresponding IDs. For example, if a user wants to search for tweets that contain a specific keyword in the tweet text, they would need to know the ID of the field that contains the tweet text. By using the `FieldNameToIdMapping` class, the user can simply provide the field name and the class will return the corresponding ID.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Twitter search project:

```
Map<String, Integer> fieldMap = new HashMap<>();
fieldMap.put("text", 1);
fieldMap.put("user", 2);
FieldNameToIdMapping mapping = FieldNameToIdMapping.newFieldNameToIdMapping(fieldMap);
int tweetTextFieldId = mapping.getFieldID("text");
int userFieldId = mapping.getFieldID("user");
``` 

In this example, a new `Map` object is created that maps the field names "text" and "user" to their corresponding IDs. The `newFieldNameToIdMapping` method is then called to create a new instance of `FieldNameToIdMapping` that uses this map to look up field IDs. Finally, the `getFieldID` method is called twice to get the field IDs for the "text" and "user" fields.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an abstract class for mapping field names to field IDs and provides a method to create a new instance of this class from a map of field names and IDs.

2. What is the expected behavior if the getFieldID method is called with a fieldName that is not known to Earlybird?
- The code comments suggest that the method "Can throw unchecked exceptions" if the fieldName is not known, but the specific exception type and behavior is not defined in the code.

3. What is the advantage of using an ImmutableMap in the newFieldNameToIdMapping method?
- Using an ImmutableMap ensures that the map passed into the method cannot be modified externally, which can help prevent unexpected behavior or bugs in the code that uses the resulting FieldNameToIdMapping instance.
