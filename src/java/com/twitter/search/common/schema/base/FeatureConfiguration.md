The `FeatureConfiguration` class is a Java implementation of a feature configuration schema for a search engine. It defines the configuration for all the column stride view fields. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to define and manage the features that are used in the search engine. 

The class contains several private fields that define the feature configuration. These fields include the feature name, the index of the integer that the feature is stored in, the start position of the feature in the integer, the length of the feature in bits, the bit mask, the inverse bit mask, the maximum value of the feature, the feature type, the output feature type, the base field, the feature update constraints, and the feature normalization type. 

The class provides several public methods to access these fields, including `getName()`, `getMaxValue()`, `getValueIndex()`, `getBitStartPosition()`, `getBitLength()`, `getBitMask()`, `getInverseBitMask()`, `getBaseField()`, `getType()`, `getOutputType()`, `getFeatureNormalizationType()`, `getUpdateConstraints()`, and `validateFeatureUpdate()`. 

The `Builder` class is a nested class that provides a way to create new instances of the `FeatureConfiguration` class. It provides several methods to set the various fields of the `FeatureConfiguration` class, including `withName()`, `withType()`, `withOutputType()`, `withFeatureNormalizationType()`, `withBitRange()`, `withBaseField()`, and `withFeatureUpdateConstraint()`. 

Overall, the `FeatureConfiguration` class is an important part of the search engine's feature configuration schema. It provides a way to define and manage the features that are used in the search engine, and it allows for easy creation of new feature configurations using the `Builder` class. 

Example usage:

```
FeatureConfiguration featureConfig = FeatureConfiguration.builder()
    .withName("exampleFeature")
    .withType(ThriftCSFType.INT)
    .withOutputType(ThriftCSFType.DOUBLE)
    .withBitRange(0, 0, 16)
    .withBaseField("exampleField")
    .build();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a FeatureConfiguration class that represents a feature in a column stride view. It is used to store and retrieve features in a compressed format. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure and manipulate these features.

2. What are the constraints on the values that can be stored in a FeatureConfiguration object?
- The length of the feature must not cross an int boundary, and the maximum value of the feature is determined by its bit length. Additionally, there may be feature update constraints that limit the values that can be updated.

3. What is the purpose of the Builder class and how is it used to create FeatureConfiguration objects?
- The Builder class provides a way to construct FeatureConfiguration objects with a fluent interface. It allows the user to set various properties of the FeatureConfiguration object, such as its name, type, and bit range, and add feature update constraints. Once all the properties have been set, the build() method is called to create the FeatureConfiguration object.
