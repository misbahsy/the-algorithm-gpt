The `EarlybirdFieldType` class is an extension of Lucene's `FieldType` that contains additional settings specific to the Earlybird search engine. The purpose of this class is to provide additional settings that can be used by Lucene IndexingChains to customize the indexing process for different types of fields.

The class contains several public static final fields that are instances of `EarlybirdFieldType`. These fields are used to define the type of a field and its settings. For example, `LONG_CSF_FIELD_TYPE` is an instance of `EarlybirdFieldType` that is used to define a long field with a CSF (Compact Sparse Feature) type. The `setCsfType` method is used to set the CSF type of the field, and the `setDocValuesType` method is used to set the type of doc values that should be stored for the field.

The class also contains several private fields that are used to store additional settings for the field. These settings include whether the field should store per-position payloads, the default payload length, whether the field should become immutable after optimization, and whether the field should support ordered terms and term text lookup.

The class also contains several methods that can be used to set and get the various settings for the field. For example, the `setStorePerPositionPayloads` method is used to set whether the field should store per-position payloads, and the `getDefaultPayloadLength` method is used to get the default payload length for the field.

Overall, the `EarlybirdFieldType` class provides a way to define custom field types with additional settings that can be used to customize the indexing process for different types of fields. This class is an important part of the Earlybird search engine and is used extensively throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code defines an extension of Lucene's FieldType with additional settings specific to the Earlybird project. It is used by Lucene IndexingChains to access these additional settings.

2. What are some of the specific settings that can be configured for a field using this code?
- Some of the specific settings that can be configured for a field include: whether to store per-position payloads, the default payload length, whether the field becomes immutable after optimization, whether to support ordered terms and term text lookup, and whether to index high-frequency term pairs.

3. What is the purpose of the csfViewFeatureConfiguration field and how is it used?
- The csfViewFeatureConfiguration field is used to store feature configuration settings for a CSF view, which is a portion of another CSF. It is used to build a FeatureConfiguration object that specifies the name, type, bit range, base field, output type, normalization type, and feature update constraints for the CSF view.
