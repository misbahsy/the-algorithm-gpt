The `NumericField` class is a custom Lucene numeric field that can be used to index and search for numeric values in a Lucene index. This class is designed to replace the LegacyIntField, LegacyLongField, etc. Lucene classes that were removed in Lucene 7.0.0. 

The `NumericField` class extends the `Field` class from the Lucene library and provides two static factory methods to create new integer and long fields with the given name and value. These methods return a new instance of the `NumericField` class with the specified field name and value. The `fieldsData` member variable of the `NumericField` class is set to the boxed integer or long value, depending on the factory method used.

The `NumericField` class also defines a private constructor that takes a field name and a `FieldType` object as arguments. The `FieldType` object is used to configure the field type of the numeric field. The `NUMERIC_FIELD_TYPE` member variable is a static `FieldType` object that is initialized with the following settings:

- `setTokenized(true)` - This setting indicates that the field should be tokenized, which means that the field value should be split into tokens that can be searched independently.
- `setOmitNorms(true)` - This setting indicates that the field should omit the normalization factor, which is used to boost the relevance of shorter fields.
- `setIndexOptions(IndexOptions.DOCS)` - This setting indicates that the field should be indexed with document frequency and term frequency information, but not with position or offset information.

The `NUMERIC_FIELD_TYPE` object is then frozen to prevent further modifications.

Overall, the `NumericField` class provides a simple and efficient way to index and search for numeric values in a Lucene index. It can be used in conjunction with other Lucene fields to build complex search queries that can retrieve documents based on a combination of text and numeric criteria. 

Example usage:

```
NumericField intField = NumericField.newIntField("age", 30);
NumericField longField = NumericField.newLongField("timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis());

Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new TextField("name", "John Doe", Field.Store.YES));
doc.add(intField);
doc.add(longField);

IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(indexDir, new IndexWriterConfig(analyzer));
writer.addDocument(doc);
writer.close();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a custom Lucene numeric field called `NumericField` that can be used to store integer and long values in a Lucene index.

2. Why is `NUMERIC_FIELD_TYPE` declared as a static final field?
- `NUMERIC_FIELD_TYPE` is declared as a static final field because it is a shared constant that is used by all instances of `NumericField`. Declaring it as a static final field ensures that it is only initialized once and cannot be modified.

3. Why are the `newIntField` and `newLongField` methods static?
- The `newIntField` and `newLongField` methods are static because they create new instances of `NumericField` and do not depend on any state of an existing instance. This allows them to be called without first creating an instance of `NumericField`.
