This code defines a builder class `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder` for constructing a `ThriftDocument` object, which represents a document in the Twitter search index. The builder class provides methods to add various fields and attributes to the document, such as tweet text, hashtags, mentions, URLs, and more. These fields are used to index and search tweets in the larger project.

For example, the `withTweetText` method adds the tweet text field to the document, while the `withHashtagsField` method adds a list of hashtags. Similarly, the `withMentionsField` method adds a list of mentions, and the `withURLs` method adds a list of URLs.

The builder also handles special cases, such as adding fields for named entities, geo-location data, and language codes. For instance, the `withGeoHash` method adds the geo hash field and internal filter field, while the `withLanguageCodes` method adds fields for both the ISO language code and BCP47 language tag.

Additionally, the builder class provides methods to add flags and features to the document, such as the `withFromVerifiedAccountFlag` method, which adds a flag indicating if the tweet is from a verified account.

Before building the final `ThriftDocument`, the `prepareToBuild` method is called to ensure all necessary fields are set, such as adding the encoded tweet features field.

Here's an example of how the builder can be used:

```java
EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder builder = new EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder(...);
builder.withTweetText("Hello, world!")
       .withHashtagsField(Arrays.asList("example", "twitter"))
       .withMentionsField(Arrays.asList("user1", "user2"))
       .withURLs(Arrays.asList(new ThriftExpandedUrl(...)))
       .withGeoHash(37.7749, -122.4194)
       .withLanguageCodes("en", "en-US");
ThriftDocument document = builder.build();
```

This code creates a `ThriftDocument` with the specified tweet text, hashtags, mentions, URLs, geo-location data, and language codes.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder` class?
   **Answer**: The `EarlybirdThriftDocumentBuilder` class is a builder class for creating a `ThriftDocument` object. It provides methods to add various fields and attributes to the document, such as tweet text, hashtags, mentions, URLs, and more.

2. **Question**: How does the `withNamedEntity` method work?
   **Answer**: The `withNamedEntity` method adds named entity fields to the document based on the given `NamedEntity` object. It iterates through the contexts of the named entity and adds the entity to the appropriate fields based on the input source type and entity type.

3. **Question**: How does the `withLanguageCodes` method handle languages with variants?
   **Answer**: The `withLanguageCodes` method adds fields for both the ISO language code and the BCP47 language tag. For languages with variants, such as Simplified Chinese, the ISO language code is "zh" and the BCP47 language tag is "zh-cn". The method adds fields for both codes if they are different.
