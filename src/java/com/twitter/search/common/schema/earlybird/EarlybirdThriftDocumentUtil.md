The `EarlybirdThriftDocumentUtil` class provides utility APIs for working with `ThriftDocument` objects in the Earlybird project. The class contains a set of static methods that can be used to extract specific fields from a `ThriftDocument` object, add new fields to a `ThriftDocument`, and check whether certain flags are set in the document. 

The class contains several methods for extracting specific fields from a `ThriftDocument`, such as `getID()`, `getLinks()`, and `getCreatedAtMs()`. These methods take a `ThriftDocument` object as input and return the value of the corresponding field in the document. For example, `getID()` returns the value of the `ID_FIELD` field in the document, which represents the unique identifier of the tweet.

The class also contains several methods for adding new fields to a `ThriftDocument`, such as `addIntField()` and `addNormalizedMinEngagementField()`. These methods take a `ThriftDocument` object, a field name, and a value as input, and add a new field to the document with the specified name and value. For example, `addIntField()` adds a new integer field to the document with the specified name and value.

Finally, the class contains several methods for checking whether certain flags are set in the document, such as `isNullcastBitSet()` and `isSelfThreadFilterSet()`. These methods take a `ThriftDocument` object as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the corresponding flag is set in the document. For example, `isNullcastBitSet()` returns true if the `IS_NULLCAST_FLAG` flag is set in the document.

Overall, the `EarlybirdThriftDocumentUtil` class provides a set of utility methods for working with `ThriftDocument` objects in the Earlybird project. These methods can be used to extract specific fields from a document, add new fields to a document, and check whether certain flags are set in a document.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides utility APIs for working with ThriftDocument used in Earlybird, a Twitter search project.
- It helps extract various fields from a ThriftDocument and perform operations like adding or removing fields.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the Google Guava library and the Twitter Common library.
- It also uses a custom EarlybirdEncodedFeaturesUtil class.

3. What are some potential limitations or edge cases that a developer should be aware of when using this code?
- The code assumes that the ThriftDocument has a specific schema and field constants defined in the EarlybirdFieldConstants class.
- Some methods may return null if the requested field is not present in the ThriftDocument.
- The addNormalizedMinEngagementField method may throw an IOException if there is an error serializing the TokenStream.
