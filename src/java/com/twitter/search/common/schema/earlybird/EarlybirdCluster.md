This code defines an enum called EarlybirdCluster, which lists the different clusters available in the Earlybird system. Earlybird is a system used by Twitter to index and search tweets in real-time. The clusters listed in this enum represent different types of Earlybird clusters, each with its own unique characteristics. 

The REALTIME cluster contains 100% of tweets for about 7 days, while the PROTECTED cluster only contains tweets from protected accounts. The FULL_ARCHIVE cluster contains all tweets until about 2 days ago, and the SUPERROOT cluster talks to the other clusters instead of talking directly to Earlybirds. Finally, the REALTIME_CG cluster is a dedicated cluster for Candidate Generation use cases based on Earlybird in Home/PushService.

The code also provides several methods to check the type of a given EarlybirdCluster. The isArchive() method checks if the given cluster is an archive cluster, which in this case is only the FULL_ARCHIVE cluster. The isTwitterMemoryFormatCluster() method checks if the given cluster is a general-purpose cluster that uses Twitter's in-memory index format. The hasEarlybirds() method checks if the given cluster has Earlybirds, which is true for all clusters except the SUPERROOT cluster.

The code also defines several ImmutableSet objects that contain different combinations of Earlybird clusters. The ARCHIVE_CLUSTERS set contains only the FULL_ARCHIVE cluster, while the TWITTER_IN_MEMORY_INDEX_FORMAT_GENERAL_PURPOSE_CLUSTERS set contains the REALTIME and PROTECTED clusters. The TWITTER_IN_MEMORY_INDEX_FORMAT_ALL_CLUSTERS set contains all three general-purpose clusters, including REALTIME_CG. The GENERAL_PURPOSE_CLUSTERS set contains all four general-purpose clusters, while the ALL_CLUSTERS set contains all five clusters.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and manage different types of Earlybird clusters in the Twitter system. It can be used to check the type of a given cluster and to define sets of clusters with specific characteristics.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an enum called `EarlybirdCluster` that lists the different clusters used in the Earlybird system at Twitter, along with methods to check if a cluster is an archive, has Earlybirds, or uses a specific memory format.

2. What is the significance of the `@VisibleForTesting` annotation?
- The `@VisibleForTesting` annotation is used to indicate that the following constants are only intended to be used in testing scenarios, and should not be accessed by production code.

3. What is the difference between `GENERAL_PURPOSE_CLUSTERS` and `ALL_CLUSTERS`?
- `GENERAL_PURPOSE_CLUSTERS` includes all clusters except for `REALTIME_CG`, while `ALL_CLUSTERS` includes all clusters including `REALTIME_CG`.
