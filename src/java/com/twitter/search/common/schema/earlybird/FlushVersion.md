The `FlushVersion` enum in this code represents different versions of the data schema used in the larger project. Each version is associated with a description, a flag indicating if it's an official version, and a minor version number. The purpose of this enum is to manage the evolution of the data schema and ensure backward compatibility when reading or writing data.

The enum provides several helper methods to work with the schema versions:

- `getVersionFileExtension()`: Returns the file extension with the version number.
- `getVersionFileExtension(int flushVersion)`: Returns the file extension for a given flush version number. If the flush version is unknown, it returns null.
- `getDescription()`: Returns a string describing the current schema version.
- `getVersionNumber()`: Returns the schema's major version.
- `onOrAfter(FlushVersion other)`: Returns whether the schema version is on or after the specified version.
- `isOfficial()`: Returns whether the schema version is official. Only official segments are uploaded to HDFS.
- `getMinorVersion()`: Returns the schema's minor version.

These methods can be used in the larger project to manage data schema changes, ensuring that data is read and written correctly across different versions. For example, when reading data from a file, the code can use the `getVersionFileExtension()` method to determine the schema version of the file and then read the data accordingly. Similarly, when writing data, the code can use the `isOfficial()` method to determine if the current schema version should be used for writing the data.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `FlushVersion` enum?**

   The `FlushVersion` enum represents different versions of the partition flushing schema in the project, with each version having a description, an indication of whether it is an official version, and a minor version number.

2. **How can I get the file extension for a specific flush version?**

   You can use the `getVersionFileExtension()` method for a specific `FlushVersion` instance or the static method `getVersionFileExtension(int flushVersion)` to get the file extension for a given flush version number.

3. **How can I check if a specific flush version is official or not?**

   You can use the `isOfficial()` method for a specific `FlushVersion` instance to check if the version is official or not.
