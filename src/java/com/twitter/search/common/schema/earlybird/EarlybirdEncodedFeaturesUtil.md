The `EarlybirdEncodedFeaturesUtil` class provides utility methods for converting `EarlybirdEncodedFeatures` objects to and from byte arrays. This is useful for storing these objects in a `ThriftDocument` as a `bytesField`. 

The `toBytesForThriftDocument` method takes an `EarlybirdEncodedFeatures` object and returns a byte array that can be stored in a `ThriftDocument`. It does this by iterating over the `numInts` in the `features` object and converting each integer to a byte array using the `CSFTypeUtil.convertToBytes` method. The resulting byte array is then returned.

The `fromBytes` method takes an `ImmutableSchemaInterface` object, an `EarlybirdFieldConstants.EarlybirdFieldConstant` object, a byte array, and an offset as input. It returns an `EarlybirdEncodedFeatures` object that is constructed from the data in the byte array starting at the provided offset. It does this by creating a new `EarlybirdEncodedFeatures` object using the `newEncodedTweetFeatures` method and then iterating over the `numInts` in the object. For each integer, it uses the `CSFTypeUtil.convertFromBytes` method to convert the corresponding bytes in the byte array to an integer and sets the integer in the `features` object. The resulting `features` object is then returned.

Overall, these utility methods provide a way to convert `EarlybirdEncodedFeatures` objects to and from byte arrays, which can be useful for storing and retrieving these objects in a `ThriftDocument`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdEncodedFeaturesUtil class?
- The EarlybirdEncodedFeaturesUtil class provides methods for converting EarlybirdEncodedFeatures objects to and from byte arrays that can be stored in a ThriftDocument.

2. What is the significance of the ImmutableSchemaInterface parameter in the fromBytes method?
- The ImmutableSchemaInterface parameter is used to create a new EarlybirdEncodedFeatures object with the appropriate schema and field constants.

3. What is the role of the CSFTypeUtil class in this code?
- The CSFTypeUtil class is used to convert integers to and from byte arrays for serialization and deserialization of EarlybirdEncodedFeatures objects.
