The `ThriftDocumentBuilder` class is a builder class for building `ThriftDocuments`. It provides methods for adding different types of fields to the document, such as long, int, byte, byte array, float, string, geo, and token stream fields. The class takes a `FieldNameToIdMapping` object as a parameter in its constructor, which is used to map field names to field IDs. 

The `ThriftDocumentBuilder` class is used in the larger project to build `ThriftDocuments` that are used for indexing and searching data. The `ThriftDocument` is a data structure that represents a document in the search index. It contains a list of fields, where each field has a field ID and a field value. The field ID is an integer that represents the field name, and the field value can be of different types, depending on the field type.

The `ThriftDocumentBuilder` class provides methods for adding different types of fields to the document. For example, the `withStringField` method adds a string field to the document, which is indexed as is (not analyzed). The `withLongField` method adds a long field to the document, which is indexed as a `LongTermAttribute`. The `withTokenStreamField` method adds a field whose value is a Lucene `TokenStream`, which is serialized using Twitter's `TokenStreamSerializer`. 

The `ThriftDocumentBuilder` class also provides methods for adding geo fields and payload-weighted token stream fields. The `withGeoField` method adds a field whose value is a geo coordinate. The `withPayloadWeightTokenStreamField` method adds a list of tokens that are weighted, where the weights are stored inside the payload. 

Overall, the `ThriftDocumentBuilder` class is an important part of the larger project, as it provides a convenient way to build `ThriftDocuments` that can be used for indexing and searching data. 

Example usage:

```
FieldNameToIdMapping idMapping = new FieldNameToIdMapping();
ThriftDocumentBuilder builder = new ThriftDocumentBuilder(idMapping);

builder.withStringField("title", "The Algorithm from Twitter");
builder.withLongField("views", 1000L);
builder.withTokenStreamField("content", "This is some sample content", new byte[] {1, 2, 3});

ThriftDocument doc = builder.build();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a builder class for building ThriftDocuments, which are used for indexing and searching data in Twitter's search system.

2. What are the different types of fields that can be added using this builder class?
- The different types of fields that can be added include long, int, byte, byte array, float, Lucene TokenStream, String, geo coordinate, payload-weighted token stream, and list of longs.

3. What is the purpose of the prepareToBuild() method and how can it be used?
- The prepareToBuild() method is left empty in this class, but it can be overridden in a subclass to perform any necessary preparation before building the ThriftDocument. This can be useful for customizing the behavior of the builder class to fit specific use cases.
