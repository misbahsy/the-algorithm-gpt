The `EarlybirdServerSetManager` class is responsible for managing the server set for Earlybird, a search indexing system developed by Twitter. The server set is a dynamic list of servers that are currently available to handle requests. The purpose of this class is to allow Earlybird consumers, such as Blender, to detect when an Earlybird server goes online or offline.

The class implements the `ServerSetMember` interface, which defines methods for joining and leaving the server set. The `joinServerSet` method is called when an Earlybird server wants to join the server set. It creates a new `ServerSet` object using the `createServerSet` method of the `ZooKeeperClient` class, which is responsible for managing the connection to the ZooKeeper server. The `join` method of the `ServerSet` object is then called to add the server to the server set. The `leaveServerSet` method is called when an Earlybird server wants to leave the server set. It removes the server from the server set using the `leave` method of the `ServerSet.EndpointStatus` object.

The `EarlybirdServerSetManager` class also provides methods for determining if the server is currently in the server set (`isInServerSet`) and for getting the number of servers in the server set (`getNumberOfServerSetMembers`).

The class uses several other classes from the Earlybird project, including `PartitionConfig`, `EarlybirdConfig`, and `EarlybirdStatus`. It also uses classes from the `com.twitter.common` and `com.twitter.common_internal` packages, which provide common functionality used throughout the Twitter codebase.

Overall, the `EarlybirdServerSetManager` class is an important component of the Earlybird system, allowing servers to join and leave the server set dynamically and providing a way for consumers to detect changes in the server set.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code manages the server set for Earlybird, a Twitter search service, allowing it to join and leave the server set, and update its endpoint status. It also provides stats related to the server set and allows Earlybird to join a server set for ServiceProxy.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including Guava, ZooKeeper, and SLF4J.

3. What is the role of the EarlybirdServerSetManager class in this code?
- The EarlybirdServerSetManager class is the main class in this code and manages the server set for Earlybird. It provides methods for joining and leaving the server set, updating endpoint status, and getting server set information. It also exports stats related to the server set and allows Earlybird to join a server set for ServiceProxy.
