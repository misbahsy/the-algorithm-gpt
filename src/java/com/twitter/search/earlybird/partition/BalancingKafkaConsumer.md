The BalancingKafkaConsumer class is designed to read from two Kafka topics, tweets and updates, in proportion to the rates that those streams are written to. The purpose of this class is to ensure that both topics have nearly the same amount of lag. This is important because if one stream gets too far ahead of the other, we could end up in a situation where we couldn't apply an update because a segment has been optimized, and one of those fields became frozen, or we might drop updates because they are more than a minute old, but the tweets might still not be indexed.

The BalancingKafkaConsumer class uses a KafkaConsumer to read from the two topics. It keeps track of the timestamp of the last record read from each topic and calculates the difference between the two timestamps. If the difference is less than a threshold value, the class continues to read from both topics. If the difference is greater than the threshold value, the class pauses one of the topics to allow the other topic to catch up. If one of the topic-partitions lags the other by more than 10 seconds, it's worth it to pause the faster one and let the slower one catch up.

The BalancingKafkaConsumer class provides a poll method that calls poll on the underlying KafkaConsumer and pauses topics as necessary. The class also provides a close method to close the underlying KafkaConsumer.

This class is used in the larger project to ensure that the tweets and updates topics are read in proportion to the rates that those streams are written to. This helps to prevent situations where updates are dropped or tweets are not indexed. The BalancingKafkaConsumer class is an important part of the larger project's data processing pipeline. 

Example usage:

```java
KafkaConsumer<Long, ThriftVersionedEvents> kafkaConsumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
TopicPartition tweetTopic = new TopicPartition("tweets", 0);
TopicPartition updateTopic = new TopicPartition("updates", 0);
BalancingKafkaConsumer balancingKafkaConsumer = new BalancingKafkaConsumer(kafkaConsumer, tweetTopic, updateTopic);
ConsumerRecords<Long, ThriftVersionedEvents> records = balancingKafkaConsumer.poll(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
balancingKafkaConsumer.close();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it work?
- This code is a Kafka consumer designed to read from two streams in proportion to their rates, ensuring that both streams have nearly the same amount of lag. It does this by pausing the faster stream if it lags behind the slower one by more than 10 seconds. The consumer reads from both streams and updates the timestamps of the most recent records, then determines whether to pause or resume reading from one of the streams based on the difference in their timestamps.

2. What is the significance of the BALANCE_THRESHOLD_MS constant?
- The BALANCE_THRESHOLD_MS constant is the maximum difference in lag time between the two streams that the consumer will tolerate before pausing the faster stream. If the difference in lag time is less than this threshold, the consumer will continue reading from both streams without pausing either one.

3. What is the purpose of the SearchRateCounter objects and how are they used?
- The SearchRateCounter objects are used to track the rate at which each topic is paused by the consumer. They are initialized with a prefix and suffix based on the topic name, and are incremented each time the consumer pauses reading from that topic. The resumed counter is used to track the number of times both topics have been resumed after being paused. These counters are exported for use in monitoring and analysis of the consumer's behavior.
