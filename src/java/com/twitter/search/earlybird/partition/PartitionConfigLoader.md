The `PartitionConfigLoader` class is responsible for loading partition information for a host from the command line arguments and the Aurora scheduler. The purpose of this class is to provide a new `PartitionConfig` object for the host. 

The `getPartitionInfoForMesosConfig` method takes an `AuroraSchedulerClient` object as input and returns a `PartitionConfig` object. It first gets the `AuroraInstanceKey` object from the `EarlybirdConfig` class and checks that it is not null. It then gets the number of active tasks for the instance key from the Aurora scheduler using the `getActiveTasks` method of the `schedulerClient`. The number of active tasks is logged using the `LOG` object. 

If there is an `IOException` while getting the active tasks, a warning is logged and a `PartitionConfigLoadingException` is thrown. Otherwise, the `PartitionConfigUtil` class is used to initialize a new `PartitionConfig` object for the host using the number of active tasks. The `PartitionConfig` object is then returned.

This class is used in the larger project to load partition information for a host. The `PartitionConfig` object is used to configure the partitioning of data for processing. For example, if the project is processing tweets, the `PartitionConfig` object could be used to specify how the tweets are partitioned across different hosts for processing. 

Example usage:
```
AuroraSchedulerClient schedulerClient = new AuroraSchedulerClient();
PartitionConfig partitionConfig = PartitionConfigLoader.getPartitionInfoForMesosConfig(schedulerClient);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is used to load partition information from the command line arguments and Aurora scheduler for a project called Earlybird.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
    
    This code relies on several external libraries including Google Guava, SLF4J, and Aurora Scheduler Client.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `getPartitionInfoForMesosConfig` method?
    
    The `getPartitionInfoForMesosConfig` method takes an `AuroraSchedulerClient` object as input and is expected to return a `PartitionConfig` object for the host. It may throw a `PartitionConfigLoadingException` if it fails to get tasks from the Aurora scheduler.
