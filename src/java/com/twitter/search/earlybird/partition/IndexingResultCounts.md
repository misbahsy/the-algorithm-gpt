The `IndexingResultCounts` class is a helper class used to store counts to be logged. It has four private instance variables: `indexingCalls`, `failureRetriable`, `failureNotRetriable`, and `indexingSuccess`. The class has a default constructor that does nothing. 

The class has a public method `countResult` that takes an argument of type `ISegmentWriter.Result` and updates the internal counts based on the value of the argument. If the argument is `ISegmentWriter.Result.FAILURE_NOT_RETRYABLE`, the `failureNotRetriable` count is incremented. If the argument is `ISegmentWriter.Result.FAILURE_RETRYABLE`, the `failureRetriable` count is incremented. If the argument is `ISegmentWriter.Result.SUCCESS`, the `indexingSuccess` count is incremented. In all cases, the `indexingCalls` count is incremented.

The class has four getter methods: `getIndexingCalls`, `getFailureRetriable`, `getFailureNotRetriable`, and `getIndexingSuccess`. These methods return the values of the corresponding instance variables.

The class also overrides the `toString` method to return a string representation of the counts in a formatted string.

This class is likely used in the larger project to keep track of the results of indexing operations. It provides a way to store and retrieve counts of different types of indexing results, which can be useful for logging and monitoring purposes. 

Example usage:
```
IndexingResultCounts counts = new IndexingResultCounts();
ISegmentWriter.Result result = ISegmentWriter.Result.SUCCESS;
counts.countResult(result);
System.out.println(counts.getIndexingSuccess()); // prints 1
System.out.println(counts.toString()); // prints "[calls: 1, success: 1, fail not-retryable: 0, fail retryable: 0]"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
    
    This class is a helper class used to store counts to be logged.

2. What is the significance of the `countResult` method?
    
    The `countResult` method updates the internal counts with a single result.

3. What is the purpose of the `toString` method?
    
    The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object, including the values of the internal counts.
