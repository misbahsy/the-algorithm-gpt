The `PartitionWriter` class is responsible for writing tweet events and tweet update events to an Earlybird index. It creates new segments, adds tweets to the correct segment, and applies updates to the correct segment. 

The `PartitionWriter` class has a constructor that takes in a `TweetCreateHandler`, a `TweetUpdateHandler`, a `CriticalExceptionHandler`, a `PenguinVersion`, and a `Clock`. The `TweetCreateHandler` and `TweetUpdateHandler` are responsible for handling tweet create and tweet update events, respectively. The `CriticalExceptionHandler` is responsible for handling critical exceptions that occur during the indexing process. The `PenguinVersion` is used to determine which version of the ThriftIndexingEvent to use when indexing a batch of TVE records. The `Clock` is used to get the current time.

The `PartitionWriter` class has a method called `indexBatch` that takes in an iterable of `ConsumerRecord<Long, ThriftVersionedEvents>` and returns a boolean. This method indexes a batch of TVE records by iterating over the records and calling the `indexTVE` method for each record. It also calculates the minimum tweet age in milliseconds and returns a boolean indicating whether the minimum tweet age is less than the `CAUGHT_UP_FRESHNESS` duration.

The `PartitionWriter` class has a method called `indexTVE` that takes in a `ThriftVersionedEvents` struct and returns void. This method indexes a `ThriftVersionedEvents` struct by getting the `ThriftIndexingEvent` for the `PenguinVersion` and calling the appropriate handler method based on the event type. If the `ThriftIndexingEvent` is null, it logs an error and increments the `MISSING_PENGUIN_VERSION` counter.

The `PartitionWriter` class has a method called `prepareAfterStartingWithIndex` that takes in a `long` and returns void. This method prepares the `TweetCreateHandler` after starting with an index by setting the `maxIndexedTweetId`.

The `PartitionWriter` class has a method called `logState` that returns void. This method logs the state of the `PartitionWriter`, including the number of events indexed and the state of the `TweetCreateHandler` and `TweetUpdateHandler`.

Overall, the `PartitionWriter` class is an important component of the Earlybird indexing process. It is responsible for writing tweet events and tweet update events to an Earlybird index and ensuring that they are added to the correct segment. It also handles critical exceptions that occur during the indexing process.
