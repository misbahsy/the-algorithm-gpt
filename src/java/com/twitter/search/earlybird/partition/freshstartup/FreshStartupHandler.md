The `FreshStartupHandler` class in this code is responsible for bootstrapping an index by indexing tweets and updates in parallel. This is useful when starting the indexing process from scratch, without relying on a serialized index in HDFS. The class provides methods to index tweets and updates from a specified time period or to perform a fast index for development purposes.

The `parallelIndexFromScratch()` method is the main method for indexing tweets and updates in parallel. It first finds the end offsets for the tweets Kafka topic and then generates the offsets at which tweets begin and end for each segment that needs to be created. It then indexes the segments in parallel, limiting the number of segments that are currently indexed due to memory limitations. After indexing tweets and updates, it runs a garbage collection to free up memory.

The `FreshStartupHandler` class also provides methods to verify the constructed index by comparing it to all tweets in the tweets stream. This is useful for testing and debugging purposes but should not be used in a production environment.

Here's an example of how the `FreshStartupHandler` class can be used in the larger project:

```java
FreshStartupHandler freshStartupHandler = new FreshStartupHandler(
  clock,
  earlybirdKafkaConsumersFactory,
  tweetTopic,
  updateTopic,
  segmentManager,
  maxSegmentSize,
  lateTweetBuffer,
  criticalExceptionHandler
);

// Index tweets and updates from scratch
EarlybirdIndex earlybirdIndex = freshStartupHandler.parallelIndexFromScratch();
```

This class is essential for the initial setup of the indexing process in the larger project, as it helps create the necessary segments and index the tweets and updates efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `FreshStartupHandler` class and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `FreshStartupHandler` class is responsible for bootstrapping an index by indexing tweets and updates in parallel. It provides methods for indexing from scratch, fast indexing for development purposes, and parallel indexing without relying on a serialized index in HDFS.

2. **Question**: How does the `parallelIndexFromScratch()` method work and what is its output?
   **Answer**: The `parallelIndexFromScratch()` method indexes the segments in parallel, limiting the number of segments that are currently indexed due to memory limitations. It then indexes some updates in another pass. The output of this function is an `EarlybirdIndex` object containing N segments, where the first N-1 are optimized and the last one is not.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `verifyConstructedIndex()` method and when should it be used?
   **Answer**: The `verifyConstructedIndex()` method is used to print statistics about the constructed index compared to all tweets in the tweets stream. It should only be run for testing and debugging purposes, and never in a production environment.
