The `SegmentTweetsIndexingResult` class is a data container that holds the results of indexing tweets for a single segment. It contains four fields: `minRecordTimestampMs`, `maxRecordTimestampMs`, `maxIndexedTweetId`, and `segmentWriter`. The first two fields represent the minimum and maximum timestamps of the tweets that were indexed, respectively. The third field represents the maximum tweet ID that was indexed. The fourth field is a `SegmentWriter` object that is used to write the indexed tweets to disk.

This class is likely used in the larger project to keep track of the results of indexing tweets for each segment. It provides a convenient way to store and retrieve the relevant information about each segment's indexing results. For example, it can be used to determine the time range and tweet ID range of the tweets that were indexed for a particular segment.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
SegmentWriter segmentWriter = new SegmentWriter(segmentName);
long minRecordTimestampMs = ...; // minimum timestamp of indexed tweets
long maxRecordTimestampMs = ...; // maximum timestamp of indexed tweets
long maxIndexedTweetId = ...; // maximum tweet ID of indexed tweets
SegmentTweetsIndexingResult indexingResult = new SegmentTweetsIndexingResult(
    minRecordTimestampMs, maxRecordTimestampMs, maxIndexedTweetId, segmentWriter);
```

In this example, a `SegmentWriter` object is created with a given segment name. The minimum and maximum timestamps and maximum tweet ID of the indexed tweets are also provided. These values are then used to create a new `SegmentTweetsIndexingResult` object, which is stored and used to keep track of the indexing results for this segment.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the larger project?
- This class represents data collected and created while indexing tweets for a single segment. It likely serves as a container for this data and is used by other classes or methods in the indexing process.

2. What is the significance of the `SegmentWriter` parameter in the constructor and `getSegmentWriter()` method?
- The `SegmentWriter` parameter in the constructor and `getSegmentWriter()` method likely represents an object responsible for writing the indexed tweets to a segment. It may be used to write the data collected in this class to a specific segment.

3. What is the purpose of the `toString()` method and how is it used?
- The `toString()` method likely returns a formatted string representation of the data collected in this class. It may be used for debugging or logging purposes to provide information about the indexing process for a single segment.
