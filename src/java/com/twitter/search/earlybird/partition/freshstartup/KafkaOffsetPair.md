The code defines a class called `KafkaOffsetPair` which represents a pair of offsets in a Kafka topic partition. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to check if a given offset falls within a certain range of offsets. 

The class has two private fields, `beginOffset` and `endOffset`, which represent the beginning and end of the offset range, respectively. The constructor takes these two values as arguments and initializes the fields. 

The class also has a public method called `includes` which takes a long value representing an offset and returns a boolean indicating whether the offset falls within the range defined by the `beginOffset` and `endOffset` fields. This method is useful for checking whether a given message offset has already been processed or not. 

For example, suppose we have a Kafka topic partition with offsets ranging from 0 to 100. We can create a `KafkaOffsetPair` object representing the range of offsets we want to process, say from 50 to 75, as follows:

```
KafkaOffsetPair offsetPair = new KafkaOffsetPair(50, 75);
```

We can then use the `includes` method to check whether a given offset falls within this range:

```
long offset = 60;
if (offsetPair.includes(offset)) {
  // process message with offset 60
} else {
  // skip message with offset 60
}
```

Overall, this class provides a simple and reusable way to represent and check offset ranges in Kafka topic partitions, which is a common task in many Kafka-based applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
   This class is used to represent a pair of Kafka offsets, with methods to check if a given offset is included in the range and to retrieve the beginning and end offsets.

2. What is the significance of the "final" keyword in the declaration of the instance variables?
   The "final" keyword indicates that the values of the instance variables cannot be changed once they are set in the constructor, making them immutable.

3. How is this class used in the larger project?
   It is likely used in conjunction with other classes to manage Kafka offsets for a particular partition in the Earlybird search system on Twitter.
