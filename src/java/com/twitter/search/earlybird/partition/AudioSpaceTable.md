The `AudioSpaceTable` class is a thread-safe data structure that keeps track of audio spaces that have started and finished. It is used to record audio space start and finish events, check if an audio space is currently running, and purge old audio spaces that have not been active for more than 12 hours. 

The class has three main data structures: `startedSpaces`, `finishedSpaces`, and `timestampedSpaceEvents`. `startedSpaces` and `finishedSpaces` are thread-safe sets that store the IDs of audio spaces that have started and finished, respectively. `timestampedSpaceEvents` is a thread-safe queue that stores the timestamp and ID of each start and finish event. 

The class has six `SearchRateCounter` objects that are used to keep track of various statistics related to audio spaces, such as the number of start and finish events, the number of duplicate start and finish events, and the number of start events processed after corresponding finish events. 

The class has four public methods: `audioSpaceStarts`, `audioSpaceFinishes`, `isRunning`, and `toString`. 

The `audioSpaceStarts` method is called when an audio space starts. It increments the `audioSpaceStarts` counter, adds the space ID to the `startedSpaces` set, and adds a timestamped start event to the `timestampedSpaceEvents` queue. If the space ID has been seen before, it increments the `audioSpaceDuplicateStarts` counter. If the space ID is already in the `finishedSpaces` set, it increments the `startsProcessedAfterCorrespondingFinishes` counter. Finally, it calls the `purgeOldSpaces` method to remove old audio spaces from the `startedSpaces` and `finishedSpaces` sets. 

The `audioSpaceFinishes` method is called when an audio space finishes. It increments the `audioSpaceFinishes` counter, adds the space ID to the `finishedSpaces` set, and adds a timestamped finish event to the `timestampedSpaceEvents` queue. If the space ID has been seen before, it increments the `audioSpaceDuplicateFinishes` counter. If the space ID is not in the `startedSpaces` set, it increments the `finishesProcessedWithoutCorrespondingStarts` counter. Finally, it calls the `purgeOldSpaces` method to remove old audio spaces from the `startedSpaces` and `finishedSpaces` sets. 

The `isRunning` method is called to check if an audio space is currently running. It increments the `isRunningCalls` counter and returns `true` if the space ID is in the `startedSpaces` set and not in the `finishedSpaces` set. 

The `toString` method returns a string that contains various statistics related to audio spaces, such as the number of start and finish events, the number of retained start and finish IDs, and the number of currently live audio spaces. 

Overall, the `AudioSpaceTable` class is a useful data structure for keeping track of audio spaces that have started and finished. It is thread-safe and provides various statistics related to audio spaces. It can be used in a larger project that involves audio streaming or real-time communication. 

Example usage:

```
Clock clock = new SystemClock();
AudioSpaceTable audioSpaceTable = new AudioSpaceTable(clock);

// Record audio space start event
audioSpaceTable.audioSpaceStarts("space1");

// Record audio space finish event
audioSpaceTable.audioSpaceFinishes("space1");

// Check if audio space is running
boolean isRunning = audioSpaceTable.isRunning("space1");

// Get started and finished audio spaces
Set<String> startedSpaces = audioSpaceTable.getStartedSpaces();
Set<String> finishedSpaces = audioSpaceTable.getFinishedSpaces();

// Print statistics
System.out.println(audioSpaceTable.toString());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the AudioSpaceTable class?
- The AudioSpaceTable class is used to keep track of audio spaces that have started and finished within the last 12 hours.

2. What is the significance of the timestampedSpaceEvents queue?
- The timestampedSpaceEvents queue contains both start and finish events to aid in the case where only one event is received for a spaceId, without this, the sets may never be purged.

3. What is the purpose of the purgeOldSpaces() method?
- The purgeOldSpaces() method is called on every start space event received and cleans up the retained spaces so memory usage does not become too high. It removes expired events from the startedSpaces and finishedSpaces sets.
