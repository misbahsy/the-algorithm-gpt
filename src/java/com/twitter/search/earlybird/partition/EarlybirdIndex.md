The `EarlybirdIndex` class is a data structure that represents an index of tweet data segments. It contains information about the segments, such as their offsets and whether they have been optimized. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to organize and manage tweet data for efficient searching and retrieval.

The `EarlybirdIndex` class has several fields, including a list of `SegmentInfo` objects, which contain information about each segment, such as its start and end offsets and whether it has been optimized. The class also has fields for the Kafka offsets for the tweet create and update streams, as well as the maximum indexed tweet ID.

The constructor for the `EarlybirdIndex` class takes in a list of `SegmentInfo` objects, as well as the Kafka offsets and maximum indexed tweet ID. It sorts the list of `SegmentInfo` objects and stores them in the `segmentInfoList` field. There is also a constructor that takes in only the list of `SegmentInfo` objects and Kafka offsets, and sets the maximum indexed tweet ID to -1.

The `EarlybirdIndex` class provides several getter methods for accessing its fields, such as `getSegmentInfoList()`, `getTweetOffset()`, `getUpdateOffset()`, and `getMaxIndexedTweetId()`. It also provides a method called `numOfNonOptimizedSegments()`, which returns the number of non-optimized segments in the index.

This class is likely used in the larger project to manage and organize tweet data for efficient searching and retrieval. Other classes in the project may use the `EarlybirdIndex` class to access tweet data segments and perform operations on them, such as searching for specific tweets or updating tweet data. For example, a search algorithm may use the `EarlybirdIndex` class to quickly locate tweet data segments that contain relevant tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdIndex class?
- The EarlybirdIndex class is used to represent an index for a set of segments, with information about tweet and update offsets and the maximum indexed tweet ID.

2. What is the significance of the MAX_NUM_OF_NON_OPTIMIZED_SEGMENTS constant?
- The MAX_NUM_OF_NON_OPTIMIZED_SEGMENTS constant specifies the maximum number of non-optimized segments that can be present in the index.

3. What does the numOfNonOptimizedSegments() method do?
- The numOfNonOptimizedSegments() method returns the number of non-optimized segments in the index.
