The `DynamicPartitionConfig` class is responsible for keeping track of an up-to-date `PartitionConfig` object. The `PartitionConfig` object may be periodically reloaded from ZooKeeper. The `DynamicPartitionConfig` class is practically a singleton in the Earlybird app. If you need a consistent view of the current partition configuration, make sure to grab a reference to a single `PartitionConfig` using `getCurrentPartitionConfig()` and reuse that object.

The `DynamicPartitionConfig` class has two constructors, one of which takes an initial `PartitionConfig` object. The `getCurrentPartitionConfig()` method returns the current `PartitionConfig` object. The `setCurrentPartitionConfig()` method verifies that the new partition config is compatible with the old one, and if it is, updates the number of replicas per partition based on the new partition config.

The `DynamicPartitionConfig` class has three static variables, `FAILED_UPDATE_COUNTER_NAME`, `SUCCESSFUL_UPDATE_COUNTER`, and `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION`. `FAILED_UPDATE_COUNTER_NAME` and `SUCCESSFUL_UPDATE_COUNTER` are `SearchCounter` objects that keep track of the number of failed and successful updates, respectively. `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION` is a `SearchLongGauge` object that keeps track of the number of replicas in the hash partition.

Here is an example of how to use the `DynamicPartitionConfig` class:

```
PartitionConfig initialConfig = new PartitionConfig();
DynamicPartitionConfig dynamicPartitionConfig = new DynamicPartitionConfig(initialConfig);
PartitionConfig currentPartitionConfig = dynamicPartitionConfig.getCurrentPartitionConfig();
// Use currentPartitionConfig object
PartitionConfig newPartitionConfig = new PartitionConfig();
dynamicPartitionConfig.setCurrentPartitionConfig(newPartitionConfig);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `DynamicPartitionConfig` that keeps track of an up-to-date `PartitionConfig` and allows for updating the number of replicas per partition based on the new partition config.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has external dependencies on `com.google.common.base.Preconditions`, `org.slf4j.Logger`, `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`, `com.twitter.search.common.metrics.SearchCounter`, and `com.twitter.search.common.metrics.SearchLongGauge`.

3. What is the significance of the `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION` metric?
- The `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION` metric is a `SearchLongGauge` that keeps track of the number of replicas per partition in the hash partition. It is assumed to be practically a singleton in the Earlybird app.
