The `TimeLimitedHadoopExistsCall` class is designed to abstract the details of making time-limited calls to Hadoop. The class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. During the development of the project, the team discovered that Hadoop API calls can take a long time (seconds, minutes) if the Hadoop cluster is in a bad state. This class is a fix on top of the Hadoop API's exists call and it introduces a timeout. The main motivation for having this as an external class is for testability.

The class has two constructors, one that takes a `FileSystem` object and another that takes a `FileSystem` object and an integer value representing the time limit in seconds. The `hadoopCallsTimeLimiter` is created using the `SimpleTimeLimiter.create()` method, which takes an `ExecutorService` object as an argument. The `ExecutorService` is created using the `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()` method, which creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads. The `hadoopExistsCall()` method is called by the `exists()` method, which is the main method of the class. The `exists()` method takes a `Path` object as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the path exists on Hadoop or not. 

The `hadoopExistsCall()` method is responsible for calling the `FileSystem.exists()` method and measuring the time it takes to execute the call. The `EXISTS_CALLS_TIMER` object is used to measure the time taken by the call. The `EXISTS_CALLS_EXCEPTION` object is used to count the number of exceptions thrown by the call. The `exists()` method calls the `hadoopCallsTimeLimiter.callWithTimeout()` method, which takes a `Callable` object, a time limit, and a time unit as arguments. The `Callable` object is created using an anonymous inner class that calls the `hadoopExistsCall()` method. If the call takes longer than the time limit, a `TimeoutException` is thrown. If an exception is thrown by the call, the `EXISTS_CALLS_EXCEPTION` counter is incremented. 

In summary, the `TimeLimitedHadoopExistsCall` class provides a way to make time-limited calls to Hadoop's `FileSystem.exists()` method. The class is designed to handle situations where the Hadoop cluster is in a bad state and the API calls take a long time to execute. The class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter and is designed to be testable. 

Example usage:

```
FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystem.get(new Configuration());
TimeLimitedHadoopExistsCall existsCall = new TimeLimitedHadoopExistsCall(fileSystem);
Path path = new Path("/path/to/file");
boolean exists = existsCall.exists(path);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code abstracts details of making time-limited calls to Hadoop and introduces a timeout to fix issues caused by Hadoop API calls taking a long time.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Guava library for the SimpleTimeLimiter class.

3. What is the significance of the metrics being collected in this code?
- The metrics being collected in this code are used to track the time and frequency of Hadoop exists calls, as well as the number of exceptions thrown during these calls. This information can be used to monitor the performance and health of the Hadoop cluster.
