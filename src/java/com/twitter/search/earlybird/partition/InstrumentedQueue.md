The `InstrumentedQueue` class is a data structure that extends the functionality of a standard queue by adding metrics on size, enqueue rate, and dequeue rate. This class is designed to be used in a concurrent environment, where multiple threads may be adding or removing elements from the queue simultaneously. 

The class contains a `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` object, which is a thread-safe implementation of a deque (double-ended queue). The `AtomicLong` object `queueSize` is used to keep track of the current size of the queue. The `SearchRateCounter` objects `enqueueRate` and `dequeueRate` are used to keep track of the rate at which elements are being added and removed from the queue, respectively. 

The constructor for the `InstrumentedQueue` class takes a `statsPrefix` parameter, which is used to create unique names for the metrics that will be exported. The `SearchLongGauge.export` method is called to export the `queueSize` metric, and the `SearchRateCounter.export` method is called to export the `enqueueRate` and `dequeueRate` metrics. 

The `add` method is used to add a new element to the queue. It calls the `add` method of the `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` object to add the element, increments the `enqueueRate` metric, and increments the `queueSize` metric. 

The `poll` method is used to remove and return the first element in the queue. It calls the `poll` method of the `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` object to remove the element, and if the element is not `null`, it increments the `dequeueRate` metric and decrements the `queueSize` metric. 

The `getQueueSize` method is used to get the current size of the queue. It simply returns the value of the `queueSize` metric. 

Overall, the `InstrumentedQueue` class provides a way to monitor the performance of a concurrent queue in real-time. It can be used in a variety of applications where multiple threads are adding and removing elements from a queue, such as in a search engine or a message queue system. 

Example usage:

```
InstrumentedQueue<String> queue = new InstrumentedQueue<>("myQueue");
queue.add("element1");
queue.add("element2");
String firstElement = queue.poll();
long queueSize = queue.getQueueSize();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an InstrumentedQueue class that is a queue with metrics on size, enqueue rate, and dequeue rate.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the SearchLongGauge and SearchRateCounter classes from the com.twitter.search.common.metrics package.

3. How is the queue implemented?
- The queue is implemented using a ConcurrentLinkedDeque, which is a thread-safe implementation of the Deque interface.
