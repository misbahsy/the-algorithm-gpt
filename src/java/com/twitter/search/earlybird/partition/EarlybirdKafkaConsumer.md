The `EarlybirdKafkaConsumer` class is responsible for reading TVEs (ThriftVersionedEvents) from Kafka and writing them to a `PartitionWriter`. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The class uses a `KafkaConsumer` to read from Kafka topics, `tweetTopic` and `updateTopic`. It has two main methods: `run()` and `ingestUntilCurrent()`. The `run()` method is called when the consumer is started and it reads from Kafka until it is stopped. The `ingestUntilCurrent()` method reads from Kafka starting at the given offsets and applies the events until it is caught up with the current streams. 

The `consumeBatch()` method is called by both `run()` and `ingestUntilCurrent()` methods. It reads a batch of records from Kafka and indexes them using the `PartitionWriter`. If the consumer is caught up with the current streams, it flushes the index. The `getToCurrentPostFlush()` method is called after the flush is done to get to the current state. 

The class has several metrics that are exported using `SearchCounter`, `SearchRateCounter`, and `SearchTimerStats`. These metrics are used to monitor the performance of the consumer. 

Overall, the `EarlybirdKafkaConsumer` class is a critical component of the larger project that reads from Kafka and indexes the data using a `PartitionWriter`. It is designed to be fault-tolerant and can recover from failures.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code reads TVEs (ThriftVersionedEvents) from Kafka and writes them to a PartitionWriter.

2. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guava, Apache Kafka, and SLF4J.

3. What metrics are being tracked in this code?
- This code tracks several metrics including the number of exceptions thrown during the poll loop and flushing, the time it takes to poll and index events, and the freshness of the index.
