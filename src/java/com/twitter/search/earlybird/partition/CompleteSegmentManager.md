The `CompleteSegmentManager` class is responsible for parallelizing the indexing of complete segments on startup and populating the fields used by the `PartitionManager`. It contains methods for indexing all user events, loading or indexing from scratch all complete segments, building the term dictionary that spans all earlybird segments, and warming up the data in the given segments. 

The `indexUserEvents()` method loads and indexes all user events. It creates a `StartupUserEventIndexer` object and calls its `indexAllEvents()` method to index all events.

The `indexCompleteSegments()` method loads or indexes from scratch all complete segments. It takes a `Supplier` that provides the list of all complete segments. It starts up to a maximum number of concurrent segment indexers and waits for the threads to complete fully. It then indexes all updates for all complete segments until it is fully caught up.

The `loadCompleteSegments()` method loads all given complete segments. It takes a list of all complete segments to be loaded. It starts a thread for each segment to be loaded and waits for the threads to complete fully. It then indexes all updates for all complete segments until it is fully caught up.

The `buildMultiSegmentTermDictionary()` method builds the term dictionary that spans all earlybird segments. It creates a `MultiSegmentTermDictionaryManager` object and calls its `buildDictionary()` method to build the dictionary.

The `warmSegments()` method warms up the data in the given segments. It takes an iterable of segments to warm up. It starts up to a maximum number of concurrent segment indexers and waits for the threads to complete fully.

The `SingleSegmentIndexer` class is a private class that indexes a complete segment. It creates a `SegmentLoader` object and calls its `downloadSegment()` method to check if the segment can be loaded. If it can be loaded, it sets the segment as complete and returns. Otherwise, it indexes all tweets in the segment, indexes all updates in the segment, optimizes the segment, flushes it to HDFS if necessary, and unloads the segment from memory.

Overall, the `CompleteSegmentManager` class is an important part of the indexing process for the earlybird search engine. It ensures that all complete segments are loaded and indexed in parallel on startup, and that the necessary data structures are created before the segments start serving real requests.
