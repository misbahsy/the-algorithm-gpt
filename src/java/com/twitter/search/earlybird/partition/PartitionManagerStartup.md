The `PartitionManagerStartup` class is responsible for starting and indexing data for a partition using a `PartitionManager`. This class implements the `EarlybirdStartup` interface, which requires the implementation of a `start()` method that returns a `Closeable` object. 

In the `start()` method, the `schedule()` method of the `PartitionManager` is called to schedule the partition. Then, a while loop is executed until the `EarlybirdStatus` status code is set to `CURRENT`. Within the loop, the status code is checked to see if it is set to `STOPPING`, in which case the `PartitionManager` is returned. Otherwise, the `clock` object waits for 1000 milliseconds before checking the status code again. 

Additionally, the loop logs a message to the console every 120 seconds to indicate that the Thrift port is closed until Earlybird, both indexing and query cache, is current. If the `clock` object is interrupted during the wait, an `EarlybirdStartupException` is thrown.

This class is likely used in the larger Earlybird project to manage the startup and indexing of data for a partition. It is possible that multiple instances of this class are used to manage multiple partitions. The `PartitionManager` object passed to the constructor likely contains information about the partition, such as the data to be indexed and the indexing strategy to be used. 

Example usage:

```
Clock clock = new SystemClock();
PartitionManager partitionManager = new MyPartitionManager();
PartitionManagerStartup startup = new PartitionManagerStartup(clock, partitionManager);
Closeable closeable = startup.start();
// Use partitionManager to perform indexing and querying operations
closeable.close();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is responsible for starting and indexing data for a partition using a PartitionManager.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several external libraries, including SLF4J, Twitter Common Util, and Thrift.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `start()` method?
- The `start()` method schedules the partition manager, waits for EarlybirdStatus to reach the CURRENT state, and logs a message every 120 seconds until that state is reached. Once the state is reached, it returns the partition manager.
