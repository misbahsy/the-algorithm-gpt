The `PartitionConfig` class is a configuration class that stores information about the partitioning of data in the Earlybird search system. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to configure the partitioning of data in the system, including the number of partitions, the number of replicas for each partition, and the position of the host within the hash partition. 

The class has several fields that store information about the partitioning of data, including the `tierName`, `clusterName`, `tierStartDate`, `tierEndDate`, `indexingHashPartitionID`, `maxEnabledLocalSegments`, `hostPositionWithinHashPartition`, `numReplicasInHashPartition`, and `numPartitions`. These fields are used to configure the partitioning of data in the system.

The `PartitionConfig` class has several constructors that allow for the creation of new instances of the class with different configurations. The `getPartitionConfigForTests` method is a factory method that returns a new instance of the `PartitionConfig` class with default values for testing purposes.

The `PartitionConfig` class also has several getter methods that allow for the retrieval of the configuration values stored in the class. These methods include `getTierName`, `getClusterName`, `getTierStartDate`, `getTierEndDate`, `getIndexingHashPartitionID`, `getMaxEnabledLocalSegments`, `getHostPositionWithinHashPartition`, `getNumReplicasInHashPartition`, and `getNumPartitions`.

Overall, the `PartitionConfig` class is an important part of the Earlybird search system, as it provides a way to configure the partitioning of data in the system. By configuring the partitioning of data, the Earlybird search system can be optimized for performance and scalability.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a PartitionConfig class that stores configuration information for a host in a cluster, including its tier and cluster name, date range, hash partition ID, and number of partitions. It is used to partition and shard Tweet and/or user data in Earlybird, a Twitter search system.

2. What is the significance of the DEFAULT_TIER_NAME constant and how is it used?
- The DEFAULT_TIER_NAME constant is used as the default value for the tierName field in the PartitionConfig constructor that takes only a few arguments. It represents the name of the sub-cluster that the host belongs to, and is set to "all" by default.

3. What is the purpose of the getPartitionConfigForTests methods and how are they used?
- The getPartitionConfigForTests methods return a PartitionConfig instance that is configured for testing purposes, with specific values for the number of serving timeslices, tier start and end dates, number of replicas, and number of partitions. They are used to create a PartitionConfig object that can be used in unit tests to ensure that the system behaves correctly under different configurations.
