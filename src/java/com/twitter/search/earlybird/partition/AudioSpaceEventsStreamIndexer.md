The `AudioSpaceEventsStreamIndexer` class is a Kafka consumer that indexes audio space events. It extends the `SimpleStreamIndexer` class and overrides the `validateAndIndexRecord` method to validate and index each incoming record. The class takes a `KafkaConsumer`, an `AudioSpaceTable`, and a `Clock` as parameters in its constructor. It also defines a constant `AUDIO_SPACE_EVENTS_TOPIC` that represents the Kafka topic from which it consumes messages.

The `validateAndIndexRecord` method validates each incoming record by checking if it contains a `Broadcast_id` and an `Event_metadata`. If the `Event_metadata` contains a `SPACE_PUBLISH_EVENT`, it checks if the publish event is not older than `MAX_PUBLISH_EVENTS_AGE_MS` and then calls the `audioSpaceTable.audioSpaceStarts` method to index the start of the audio space. If the `Event_metadata` contains a `SPACE_END_EVENT`, it calls the `audioSpaceTable.audioSpaceFinishes` method to index the end of the audio space.

The `getAudioSpaceTable` method returns the `AudioSpaceTable` instance used by the class, and the `printSummary` method logs a summary of the `AudioSpaceTable` instance.

This class is used in the larger project to consume audio space events from a Kafka topic and index them in an `AudioSpaceTable`. The `AudioSpaceTable` is used to keep track of the start and end times of each audio space. The indexed data can be used for various purposes such as analytics, monitoring, and reporting. 

Example usage:
```
KafkaConsumer<Long, AudioSpaceBaseEvent> kafkaConsumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
AudioSpaceTable audioSpaceTable = new AudioSpaceTable();
Clock clock = new SystemClock();
AudioSpaceEventsStreamIndexer indexer = new AudioSpaceEventsStreamIndexer(kafkaConsumer, audioSpaceTable, clock);
indexer.start();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is an implementation of a Kafka consumer that indexes AudioSpaceBaseEvent records and updates an AudioSpaceTable based on the contents of the events.
2. What is the significance of the MAX_PUBLISH_EVENTS_AGE_MS constant?
   - This constant is used to filter out old space publish events that are no longer relevant. It is set to 11 hours and is based on the assumption that spaces would not last longer than this.
3. What is the relationship between AudioSpaceEventsStreamIndexer and AudioSpaceTable?
   - AudioSpaceEventsStreamIndexer uses an instance of AudioSpaceTable to update the table based on the contents of the AudioSpaceBaseEvent records it consumes. The AudioSpaceTable instance is passed to the constructor of AudioSpaceEventsStreamIndexer.
