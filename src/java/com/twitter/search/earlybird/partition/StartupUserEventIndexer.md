The `StartupUserEventIndexer` class is responsible for indexing the `UserTable` and `UserScrubGeoMap` up until the current moment. It contains methods for indexing all user events, indexing user updates until current, and indexing `UserScrubGeoEvents` until current. 

The `indexAllEvents()` method calls `indexUserUpdates()` and `indexUserScrubGeoEvents()` to index all user events. The `indexUserUpdates()` method builds the `UserTable` and sets it in the `SegmentManager`. It then seeks to the last record timestamp and reads records until the current moment. If the `UserTable` fails to load, it logs an error and seeks to the beginning. The `indexUserScrubGeoEvents()` method seeks the `UserScrubGeoEventKafkaConsumer` to the timestamp derived from `getTimestampForUserScrubGeoEventKafkaConsumer()`. It then reads records until the current moment. 

The `getTimestampForUserScrubGeoEventKafkaConsumer()` method returns the timestamp to seek the `UserScrubGeoEventKafkaConsumer` to. If `EarlybirdIndexConfigUtil.isArchiveSearch()` is true, it grabs the scrub gen from the config file and converts the date into a timestamp. It then adds a buffer of one day to account for all `UserScrubGeoEvents` since the date of the current scrub gen. If `EarlybirdIndexConfigUtil.isArchiveSearch()` is false, it computes the timestamp 14 days from the current time to account for all events that have occurred during the lifecycle of the current index. 

The `seekToTimestampWithRetriesIfNecessary()` method seeks the `streamIndexer` to the last record timestamp with retries if necessary. It catches exceptions and sleeps before attempting to retry. It returns true if it successfully seeks to the timestamp and false if it fails. 

Overall, this class is an important part of the indexing process for the `UserTable` and `UserScrubGeoMap` in the larger project. It ensures that all user events are indexed up until the current moment and handles errors that may occur during the indexing process. 

Example usage:
```
StartupUserEventIndexer indexer = new StartupUserEventIndexer(searchIndexingMetricSet, userUpdatesStreamIndexer, userScrubGeoEventStreamIndexer, segmentManager, clock);
indexer.indexAllEvents();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is responsible for indexing the UserTable and UserScrubGeoMap up until the current moment for the Earlybird project from Twitter. It contains methods for indexing all user events, indexing user updates until current, and indexing UserScrubGeoEvents until current.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guava, SLF4J, and Twitter Common.

3. What is the significance of the constants defined in this code, such as MAX_RETRY_MILLIS_FOR_SEEK_TO_TIMESTAMP and MILLIS_IN_FOURTEEN_DAYS?
- MAX_RETRY_MILLIS_FOR_SEEK_TO_TIMESTAMP is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the code will attempt to seek to a specific timestamp before giving up. MILLIS_IN_FOURTEEN_DAYS is the number of milliseconds in 14 days, which is used to compute the timestamp for realtime/protected events.
