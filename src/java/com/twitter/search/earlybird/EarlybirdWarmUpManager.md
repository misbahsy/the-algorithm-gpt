The `EarlybirdWarmUpManager` class is responsible for warming up the Earlybird search indexing service. The purpose of warming up is to allow the service to join a special server set that receives production dark reads and then leave this server set after a specified period of time. This process ensures that the service is ready to handle production traffic and that the search index is up-to-date.

The class takes in an instance of `EarlybirdServerSetManager`, `PartitionConfig`, `SearchIndexingMetricSet`, `Decider`, and `Clock` as constructor arguments. The `EarlybirdServerSetManager` is responsible for managing the server set that the service joins during the warm-up process. The `PartitionConfig` contains the configuration for the partition that the service belongs to. The `SearchIndexingMetricSet` contains the metrics that are used to monitor the search indexing process. The `Decider` is used to determine the warm-up duration, and the `Clock` is used to measure the time.

The `warmUp()` method is the main method of the class. It first gets the warm-up duration from the `Decider` using the `getAvailability()` method. If the warm-up duration is set to 0, the method returns without doing anything. Otherwise, the service joins the server set using the `joinServerSet()` method of the `EarlybirdServerSetManager`. The `doWarmUp()` method is then called, which sleeps for the specified duration while checking if the server is going down every second. If the method is interrupted, the service leaves the server set using the `leaveServerSet()` method of the `EarlybirdServerSetManager`. If the method completes successfully, the service also leaves the server set.

The `doWarmUp()` method is protected and can be overridden for testing purposes. It sleeps for the specified duration while checking if the server is going down every second. It also logs the start and end of the warm-up process and updates the search indexing metrics.

Overall, the `EarlybirdWarmUpManager` class is an important part of the Earlybird search indexing service. It ensures that the service is ready to handle production traffic by warming up the service and updating the search index.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdWarmUpManager class?
- The EarlybirdWarmUpManager class is responsible for warming up the Earlybird by joining a special server set that gets production dark reads, and leaving this server set after a specified period of time.

2. What is the significance of the WARM_UP_ON_DURATION_DECIDER_KEY_PATTERN variable?
- The WARM_UP_ON_DURATION_DECIDER_KEY_PATTERN variable is used to get the warm up duration for a specific cluster from the Decider.

3. What is the purpose of the doWarmUp() method?
- The doWarmUp() method is responsible for sleeping for a specified duration of time while checking if the server is going down every second.
