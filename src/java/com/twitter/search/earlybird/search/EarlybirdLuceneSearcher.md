The `EarlybirdLuceneSearcher` class is an abstract class that extends the `IndexSearcher` class from the Apache Lucene library. It provides methods for filling facet information and metadata for facet and term statistics results, as well as collecting term statistics and writing explanations for search results. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a framework for implementing Lucene searchers that can be used in the larger Earlybird project. The Earlybird project is a search and analytics platform developed by Twitter that is used to index and search large volumes of tweets and other social media data. The `EarlybirdLuceneSearcher` class is used to implement custom searchers that can be used to search the indexed data and return search results that include facet information and term statistics.

The `fillFacetResults` method takes a `AbstractFacetTermCollector` object and a `ThriftSearchResults` object as input and fills the facet information for all the search results. The `fillFacetResultMetadata` and `fillTermStatsMetadata` methods fill the metadata for facet and term statistics results respectively. The `collectTermStatistics` method collects term statistics for a given request and returns the results. The `explainSearchResults` method writes explanations for the search results into a `ThriftSearchResults` object.

The `FacetSearchResults` class is a nested class that extends the `SearchResultsInfo` class and provides a way to get facet results for a given facet name and top K value.

Overall, the `EarlybirdLuceneSearcher` class provides a way to implement custom searchers that can be used to search and analyze large volumes of social media data in the Earlybird platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an abstract class `EarlybirdLuceneSearcher` that extends `IndexSearcher` and provides methods for filling facet information, collecting term statistics, and writing explanations for search results.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `IndexReader`, `Term`, `AbstractFacetTermCollector`, `FacetResultsCollector`, `TermStatisticsSearchResults`, `TermStatisticsRequestInfo`, `ThriftFacetCount`, `ThriftFacetFieldResults`, `ThriftSearchResults`, `ThriftTermStatisticsResults`, `ImmutableSchemaInterface`, `EarlybirdSearcher`, `SearchRequestInfo`, and `SimpleSearchResults`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the methods defined in this code?
- The `fillFacetResults` method takes an `AbstractFacetTermCollector` and a `ThriftSearchResults` object as input and fills the facet information for the search results. The `fillFacetResultMetadata` and `fillTermStatsMetadata` methods take a `Map` or `ThriftTermStatisticsResults` object, an `ImmutableSchemaInterface`, and a `byte` as input and fill the metadata for the facet or term statistics results. The `collectTermStatistics` method takes a `TermStatisticsRequestInfo`, an `EarlybirdSearcher`, and an `int` as input and returns the term statistics results. The `explainSearchResults` method takes a `SearchRequestInfo`, a `SimpleSearchResults`, and a `ThriftSearchResults` object as input and writes an explanation for the search results.
