The `SocialSearchResultsCollector` class is a subclass of `SearchResultsCollector` and is used to collect social search results. It takes in several parameters including an `ImmutableSchemaInterface` object, a `SearchRequestInfo` object, a `SocialFilter` object, an `EarlybirdSearcherStats` object, an `EarlybirdCluster` object, a `UserTable` object, and an integer `requestDebugMode`. 

The `SocialSearchResultsCollector` class overrides two methods from its superclass: `doCollect` and `startSegment`. The `doCollect` method takes in a `long` tweet ID and adds a new `Hit` object to the `results` list if the `socialFilter` object is `null` or if the `socialFilter` object accepts the current document ID. The `startSegment` method is called before a new segment is started and initializes the `socialFilter` object if it is not `null`.

This class is likely used in the larger project to collect social search results based on a given search query. The `SocialFilter` object is likely used to filter out irrelevant results and only return results that are relevant to the search query. The `EarlybirdSearcherStats` object is likely used to collect statistics on the search results, such as the number of results returned and the time it took to return the results. The `EarlybirdCluster` object is likely used to group similar search results together. The `UserTable` object is likely used to store information about users who posted the search results. 

Example usage:

```
ImmutableSchemaInterface schema = new ImmutableSchemaInterface();
SearchRequestInfo searchRequestInfo = new SearchRequestInfo("social search query");
SocialFilter socialFilter = new SocialFilter();
EarlybirdSearcherStats searcherStats = new EarlybirdSearcherStats();
EarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster();
UserTable userTable = new UserTable();
int requestDebugMode = 1;

SocialSearchResultsCollector collector = new SocialSearchResultsCollector(
    schema, searchRequestInfo, socialFilter, searcherStats, cluster, userTable, requestDebugMode);

long tweetID = 123456789;
collector.doCollect(tweetID);

collector.startSegment();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a subclass of `SearchResultsCollector` and is used to collect social search results. It likely fits into a larger project related to social search functionality.

2. What is the `SocialFilter` class and how does it interact with this code?
- The `SocialFilter` class is passed as a parameter to the constructor of `SocialSearchResultsCollector` and is used to filter search results based on social criteria. It is also used in the `startSegment` method to initialize the filter.

3. What is the significance of the `doCollect` method and how is it used?
- The `doCollect` method is called for each tweet ID that is collected during the search process. It adds a new `Hit` object to the `results` list if the `socialFilter` accepts the current document ID.
