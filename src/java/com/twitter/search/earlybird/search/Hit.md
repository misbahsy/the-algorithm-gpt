The `Hit` class is a part of the Earlybird search package in the Twitter Algorithm project. It represents a document that matches a query being processed by Earlybird. The purpose of this class is to provide an abstraction for a document that matches a query and to store relevant metadata about the document.

The `Hit` class has three instance variables: `timeSliceID`, `statusID`, and `metadata`. `timeSliceID` and `statusID` are `long` values that represent the time slice and status ID of the document, respectively. `metadata` is an instance of the `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` class, which stores metadata about the document.

The `Hit` class provides several methods to access and modify its instance variables. The `getTimeSliceID()` and `getStatusID()` methods return the `timeSliceID` and `statusID` values, respectively. The `getMetadata()` method returns the `metadata` instance variable. The `setMetadata()` method sets the `metadata` instance variable to a given `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object.

The `Hit` class also implements the `Comparable` interface, which allows instances of the class to be compared to each other. The `compareTo()` method compares two `Hit` objects based on their `statusID` values.

Finally, the `Hit` class provides a `toString()` method that returns a string representation of the `Hit` object. This method returns a string that includes the `statusID`, `timeSliceID`, and `score` metadata values.

Overall, the `Hit` class provides a way to represent and manipulate documents that match a query being processed by Earlybird. It is likely used extensively throughout the Earlybird search package in the Twitter Algorithm project. Here is an example of how the `Hit` class might be used:

```
Hit hit = new Hit(123456, 789012);
ThriftSearchResultMetadata metadata = new ThriftSearchResultMetadata();
metadata.setScore(0.8);
hit.setMetadata(metadata);
System.out.println(hit.toString());
```

This code creates a new `Hit` object with `timeSliceID` 123456 and `statusID` 789012. It then creates a new `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object and sets its `score` value to 0.8. Finally, it sets the `metadata` instance variable of the `Hit` object to the new `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object and prints out the string representation of the `Hit` object. The output would be:

```
Hit[tweetID=789012,timeSliceID=123456,score=0.8]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `Hit` that represents a document matching a query in the Earlybird project.

2. What is the significance of the `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` class?
   - The `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` class is used to store metadata associated with a search result, such as its score.

3. What is the purpose of the `compareTo` method?
   - The `compareTo` method is used to compare two `Hit` objects based on their `statusID` values, with higher values being considered "less than" lower values. This is used for sorting `Hit` objects in descending order of `statusID`.
