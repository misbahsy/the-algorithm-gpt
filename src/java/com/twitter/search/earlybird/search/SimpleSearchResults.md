The `SimpleSearchResults` class is a subclass of `SearchResultsInfo` and is used to store and retrieve search results. It has two constructors, one that takes an integer `size` and another that takes a `List` of `Hit` objects. The `size` parameter is used to initialize the `hits` array with a fixed size, while the `List` constructor initializes the `hits` array with the size of the `List` and populates it with the `Hit` objects from the `List`.

The `SimpleSearchResults` class has several methods to retrieve information about the search results. The `hits()` method returns an array of `Hit` objects, while the `numHits()` method returns the number of hits in the search results. The `setNumHits()` method can be used to set the number of hits in the search results, and the `getHit()` method can be used to retrieve a specific `Hit` object from the `hits` array.

This class is likely used in the larger project to store and retrieve search results from the Twitter API. For example, a search query could be executed using the Twitter API, and the resulting `List` of `Hit` objects could be passed to the `SimpleSearchResults` constructor to create a `SimpleSearchResults` object. This object could then be used to display the search results to the user or to perform further analysis on the search results. 

Example usage:

```
List<Hit> hits = twitterApi.search("example query");
SimpleSearchResults results = new SimpleSearchResults(hits);
System.out.println("Number of hits: " + results.numHits());
System.out.println("First hit: " + results.getHit(0));
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SearchResultsInfo` class that `SimpleSearchResults` extends?
- It is not clear from this code snippet what the `SearchResultsInfo` class does or what its purpose is.

2. What is the `Hit` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `Hit` class is referenced multiple times in this code, but it is not defined in this file. A smart developer might want to know what this class is and how it is used in the context of this code.

3. What is the difference between the two constructors for `SimpleSearchResults`?
- One constructor takes an integer `size` as a parameter, while the other takes a `List` of `Hit` objects. A smart developer might want to know why there are two different constructors and when to use each one.
