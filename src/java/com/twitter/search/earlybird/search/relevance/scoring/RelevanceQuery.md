The `RelevanceQuery` class is a wrapper for a Lucene query that computes the query score and then delegates to a `ScoringFunction` for final score computation. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to customize the scoring function used in a Lucene query. 

The `RelevanceQuery` class extends the `Query` class and has two instance variables: `luceneQuery` and `scoringFunction`. The `luceneQuery` variable is the Lucene query that is being wrapped, and the `scoringFunction` variable is the scoring function that is used to compute the final score. 

The `RelevanceQuery` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes a Lucene query and a scoring function as arguments and sets the `ignoreLuceneQueryScoreExplanation` variable to `false`. The second constructor takes the same arguments as the first constructor, but also takes a boolean value that determines whether or not the Lucene query score should be ignored for debug explanations. 

The `RelevanceQuery` class overrides the `rewrite` method of the `Query` class to rewrite the Lucene query. The `createWeight` method creates a `RelevanceWeight` object that wraps the Lucene query weight. The `RelevanceWeight` class extends the `Weight` class and overrides the `extractTerms`, `explain`, `scorer`, and `isCacheable` methods. 

The `explain` method of the `RelevanceWeight` class returns an explanation of the scoring for a given document. It first computes the Lucene score and then delegates to the `ScoringFunction` to compute the final score. The `scorer` method returns a `Scorer` object that scores documents matching the query. The `isCacheable` method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the weight is cacheable. 

The `hashCode` and `equals` methods of the `RelevanceQuery` class are overridden to compare the `luceneQuery` and `scoringFunction` variables. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `RelevanceQuery` object. 

Overall, the `RelevanceQuery` class provides a way to customize the scoring function used in a Lucene query. It wraps a Lucene query and delegates to a `ScoringFunction` to compute the final score. This class can be used in the larger project to fine-tune the relevance of search results. For example, a custom scoring function could be used to boost the relevance of certain types of search results or to adjust the relevance based on user feedback.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScoringFunction` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `ScoringFunction` class is used for final score computation after the Lucene query score is computed. It is used in the `RelevanceQuery` class as a delegate for final score computation.

2. What is the purpose of the `ignoreLuceneQueryScoreExplanation` boolean variable?
- The `ignoreLuceneQueryScoreExplanation` boolean variable is used to determine whether the Lucene query score should be ignored for debug explanations.

3. What is the purpose of the `explain` method in the `RelevanceWeight` class?
- The `explain` method in the `RelevanceWeight` class returns an explanation of the scoring for a given document, including both the Lucene query score and the final score computed by the `ScoringFunction`. It also takes in a `FieldHitAttribution` parameter for per-hit field attribution information.
