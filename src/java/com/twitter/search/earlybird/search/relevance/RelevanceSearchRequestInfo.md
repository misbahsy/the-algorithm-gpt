The `RelevanceSearchRequestInfo` class is a part of the Earlybird search relevance package of the Twitter search project. This class extends the `SearchRequestInfo` class and provides additional functionality for relevance-based search requests. 

The constructor of this class takes in a `ThriftSearchQuery` object, a `Query` object, a `TerminationTracker` object, and a `QualityFactor` object. The `ThriftSearchQuery` object contains the search query and options, including relevance options. The `Query` object is the Lucene query object that represents the search query. The `TerminationTracker` object is used to track the termination of the search request. The `QualityFactor` object is used to calculate the quality factor for the search request.

The `RelevanceSearchRequestInfo` class overrides the `calculateMaxHitsToProcess` method of the `SearchRequestInfo` class to calculate the maximum number of hits to process based on the relevance options. If the relevance options specify a maximum number of hits to process, that value is used. Otherwise, the value is calculated based on the quality factor and the number of results requested.

The `qualityFactorMaxHitsToProcess` method is used to reduce the maximum number of hits to process based on the quality factor. This method takes in the number of results requested and the maximum number of hits to process and returns a reduced value based on the quality factor. The quality factor is a value between 0 and 1 that represents the quality of the search results. The higher the quality factor, the more relevant the search results are.

Overall, the `RelevanceSearchRequestInfo` class provides functionality for relevance-based search requests by calculating the maximum number of hits to process based on the relevance options and the quality factor. This class is used in the larger Earlybird search project to improve the relevance of search results. 

Example usage:

```
ThriftSearchQuery searchQuery = new ThriftSearchQuery();
Query query = new Query();
TerminationTracker terminationTracker = new TerminationTracker();
QualityFactor qualityFactor = new QualityFactor();

RelevanceSearchRequestInfo relevanceSearchRequestInfo = new RelevanceSearchRequestInfo(searchQuery, query, terminationTracker, qualityFactor);

ThriftSearchRelevanceOptions relevanceOptions = relevanceSearchRequestInfo.getRelevanceOptions();
int maxHitsToProcess = relevanceOptions.getMaxHitsToProcess();

int reducedMaxHitsToProcess = relevanceSearchRequestInfo.qualityFactorMaxHitsToProcess(100, maxHitsToProcess);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `RelevanceSearchRequestInfo` that extends `SearchRequestInfo` and adds relevance options for search queries.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.google.common.base.Preconditions` class and several classes from the `com.twitter.search` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird` packages.

3. What is the significance of the `qualityFactorMaxHitsToProcess` method?
- This method reduces the maximum number of hits to process based on a quality factor, but never reduces it beyond the number of results requested. The quality factor is obtained from a `QualityFactor` object that is passed to the constructor of `RelevanceSearchRequestInfo`.
