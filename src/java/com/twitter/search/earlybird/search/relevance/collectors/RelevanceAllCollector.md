The RelevanceAllCollector class is a results collector that collects all results sorted by score, including signature-duplicates and results skipped by the scoring function. This class is part of the The Algorithm from Twitter project and is used to collect and sort search results based on their relevance to a given query. 

The class extends the AbstractRelevanceCollector class and overrides two of its methods: doCollectWithScore and doGetRelevanceResults. The doCollectWithScore method is called for each search result and adds the result to the results list. The doGetRelevanceResults method sorts the results by score and returns them as a RelevanceSearchResults object.

The RelevanceAllCollector constructor takes several parameters, including an ImmutableSchemaInterface object, a RelevanceSearchRequestInfo object, a ScoringFunction object, an EarlybirdSearcherStats object, an EarlybirdCluster object, a UserTable object, a Clock object, and an int requestDebugMode. These parameters are used to initialize the AbstractRelevanceCollector superclass and the results list.

The doCollectWithScore method takes a tweetID and a score as parameters and creates a new RelevanceHit object with the current time slice ID, the tweetID, the TweetIntegerShingleSignature, and the metadata. The metadata is populated by the scoring function based on the scoring data for the current document. The RelevanceHit object is then added to the results list.

The doGetRelevanceResults method sorts the results list by score using the RelevanceHit.COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE comparator and adds each hit to a new RelevanceSearchResults object. The method also sets the relevance statistics and the number of hits in the search results.

Overall, the RelevanceAllCollector class is an important component of the The Algorithm from Twitter project that helps to collect and sort search results based on their relevance to a given query. It is used to provide users with the most relevant search results and improve the overall search experience.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a results collector for a search relevance algorithm called Earlybird from Twitter. It collects all results sorted by score, including duplicates and results skipped by the scoring function.

2. What other classes or methods does this code interact with?
- This code interacts with several other classes and methods, including `AbstractRelevanceCollector`, `ScoringFunction`, `EarlybirdSearcherStats`, `EarlybirdCluster`, `UserTable`, `RelevanceHit`, `RelevanceSearchRequestInfo`, `RelevanceSearchResults`, and `TweetIntegerShingleSignature`.

3. What is the significance of the `TweetIntegerShingleSignature` class?
- The `TweetIntegerShingleSignature` class is used to deserialize metadata signatures for tweets in order to populate result metadata based on scoring data. It is a feature of the search relevance algorithm used in this project.
