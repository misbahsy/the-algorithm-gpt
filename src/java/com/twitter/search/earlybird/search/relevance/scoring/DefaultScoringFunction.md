The DefaultScoringFunction class is a sample scorer that is used to score search results in the larger project. It extends the ScoringFunction abstract class and overrides its methods to provide custom scoring logic. 

The constructor takes an ImmutableSchemaInterface object as a parameter, which is used to initialize the parent ScoringFunction class. The score() method takes a float value representing the Lucene query score and returns the same value. This method is used to calculate the score for each document in the search results. 

The doExplain() method returns an Explanation object that provides a textual description of how the score was calculated. In this case, it simply returns an Explanation object with the Lucene score and a string representation of the score. This method is used to provide additional information about the scoring process to the user. 

The updateRelevanceStats() method updates the ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats object with the number of documents that were scored and the number of documents that were skipped. If the score is equal to ScoringFunction.SKIP_HIT, then the document is skipped and the number of skipped documents is incremented. This method is used to keep track of the relevance statistics for the search results. 

Overall, the DefaultScoringFunction class is a simple example of a scorer that can be used to score search results in the larger project. It provides a basic implementation of the ScoringFunction abstract class and can be customized to provide more complex scoring logic if needed. 

Example usage:

```
ImmutableSchemaInterface schema = new ImmutableSchemaInterface();
DefaultScoringFunction scorer = new DefaultScoringFunction(schema);
float score = scorer.score(0.5f);
Explanation explanation = scorer.doExplain(score);
ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats stats = new ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats();
scorer.updateRelevanceStats(stats);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a sample scorer that returns the same score for every document and is a subclass of a ScoringFunction class. It is likely used in the search relevance scoring process of the larger project.

2. What is the significance of the ImmutableSchemaInterface parameter in the constructor?
- The ImmutableSchemaInterface parameter is likely used to provide the schema information needed for the scoring function to operate on the relevant fields of the documents being scored.

3. What is the purpose of the updateRelevanceStats method and how is it used?
- The updateRelevanceStats method updates the ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats object with information about the number of documents scored and skipped. It is likely used to track the performance of the scoring function and make improvements to it.
