The `RetweetBasedTopTweetsScoringFunction` class is a scoring function used in the Query Cache of the Earlybird search system from Twitter. Its purpose is to select top tweets based purely on retweet counts. The goal of this scoring function is to replace the legacy itweet score entirely. Once all legacy itweet scores are drained from the existing Earlybird index, a new parus score will replace the existing itweet score position, and this class will be deprecated. 

This scoring function is only used in Query Cache for marking top tweets in the background. When searched, those tweets are still ranked with linear or model-based scoring functions. 

The scoring function normalizes retweet counts from a range of 0 to 20 to a range of 0 to 1. The minimum retweet score threshold is set to 0.21. The scoring function also takes into account recency, with a recency score fraction of 0.1 and a sigmoid alpha of 0.008. 

The `score` method of the class takes the Lucene query score as input and returns a float score based on the retweet count and recency score. If the tweet is flagged as offensive or the user reputation is below a certain threshold, the score is set to the lowest possible score. 

The class also includes methods for computing the sigmoid function and the top tweet recency score. The `getResultMetadata` method returns the result metadata for the scoring function, including the result type, retweet count, and score. The `updateRelevanceStats` method updates the relevance statistics for the search results. 

Overall, the `RetweetBasedTopTweetsScoringFunction` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system that helps select top tweets based on retweet counts and recency.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used?
- This code is a scoring function for a toptweets query cache index selection based purely on retweet counts. It is used in Query Cache for marking top tweets in the background.

2. What are the default values for the parameters used in this scoring function?
- The default values for the parameters are: DEFAULT_RECENCY_SCORE_FRACTION = 0.1, DEFAULT_SIGMOID_APLHA = 0.008, DEFAULT_RECENCY_CENTER_MINUTES = 1080, and DEFAULT_CUT_OFF_SCORE = 0.21.

3. What is the significance of the constant RETWEET_BASED_TOP_TWEETS_LOWEST_SCORE?
- The scores for the retweet based top tweets have to be in the [0, 1] interval, so this constant is used as the lowest possible score instead of SKIP_HIT. It is only used in RetweetBasedTopTweetsScoringFunction and does not impact the final hit score.
