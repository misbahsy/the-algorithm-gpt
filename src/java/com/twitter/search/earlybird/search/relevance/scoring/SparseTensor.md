The `SparseTensor` class is a data structure used for storing sparse tensors. It is designed to be used in the context of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store and manipulate sparse tensors in a memory-efficient way. 

A sparse tensor is a multi-dimensional array that contains mostly zero values. In contrast to dense tensors, which store all values, sparse tensors only store the non-zero values. This can be useful in situations where the majority of the data is zero, as it can save a significant amount of memory.

The `SparseTensor` class contains three `ByteBuffer` objects: `sparseIndices`, `sparseValues`, and `sparseShape`. These buffers are used to store the indices, values, and shape of the sparse tensor, respectively. The `numDocs` and `numFeatures` variables are used to keep track of the number of documents and features in the tensor.

The `addValue` method is used to add a value to the sparse tensor. It takes a `featureId` and a `value` as input and stores them in the `sparseIndices` and `sparseValues` buffers, respectively. The `getSparseValues`, `getSparseIndices`, and `getSparseShape` methods are used to retrieve the values, indices, and shape of the sparse tensor, respectively.

Overall, the `SparseTensor` class provides a way to store and manipulate sparse tensors in a memory-efficient way. It can be used in a variety of applications where sparse tensors are used, such as natural language processing and machine learning. 

Example usage:

```
SparseTensor tensor = new SparseTensor(10, 100);
tensor.addValue(0, 1.0f);
tensor.addValue(1, 2.0f);
tensor.addValue(2, 3.0f);
ByteBuffer values = tensor.getSparseValues();
ByteBuffer indices = tensor.getSparseIndices();
ByteBuffer shape = tensor.getSparseShape();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code defines a `SparseTensor` class that represents a sparse tensor in memory. It is used for scoring relevance of search results in the Earlybird search system.

2. What is the significance of the `ByteBuffer` class in this code?
- The `ByteBuffer` class is used to allocate and manage memory for the sparse tensor data. It is used to store the sparse indices, values, and shape.

3. Why is the `SparseTensor` class not part of the Cortex common code?
- The `SparseTensor` class is not part of the Cortex common code because it is not currently possible to create a `SparseTensor` that relies only on `ByteBuffer`.
