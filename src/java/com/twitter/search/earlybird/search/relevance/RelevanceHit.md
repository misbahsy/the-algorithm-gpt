The `RelevanceHit` class is a subclass of the `Hit` class and provides additional functionality for computing and comparing the relevance scores of search results. It implements the `SignatureProvider` interface, which requires it to provide a `TweetIntegerShingleSignature` object that represents the signature of the tweet associated with the hit. 

The `RelevanceHit` class has two constructors, one of which takes a `TweetIntegerShingleSignature` object and a `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object as arguments. The `update` method can be used to update the data associated with a `RelevanceHit` object. The `getScore` method returns the relevance score of the hit, which is obtained from the `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object associated with the hit. If the `metadata` field is null, the method returns a constant value defined in the `ScoringFunction` class. 

The `RelevanceHit` class provides two static `Comparator` objects, `COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE` and `PQ_COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE`, which can be used to sort a list of `RelevanceHit` objects based on their relevance scores. The `COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE` comparator sorts the hits in descending order of their scores, and if two hits have the same score, the most recent one (i.e., the one with the higher `statusID`) is considered to be more relevant. The `PQ_COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE` comparator reverses the order of the `COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE` comparator, which is useful for sorting hits in a priority queue.

Overall, the `RelevanceHit` class provides a way to represent and manipulate search results based on their relevance scores. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the `com.twitter.search.earlybird.search.relevance` package to implement search functionality in the larger project. For example, the `RelevanceSearcher` class might use `RelevanceHit` objects to represent search results and sort them based on their relevance scores.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the RelevanceHit class?
- The RelevanceHit class is a subclass of the Hit class and provides additional functionality for relevance scoring in Twitter search results.

2. What is the significance of the TweetIntegerShingleSignature class?
- The TweetIntegerShingleSignature class is used to generate a signature for each tweet, which is then used in relevance scoring.

3. Why are there two different comparators for RelevanceHit objects?
- The COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE comparator is used to sort RelevanceHit objects based on their relevance score, while the PQ_COMPARATOR_BY_SCORE comparator is used to sort them in reverse order for use in a priority queue.
