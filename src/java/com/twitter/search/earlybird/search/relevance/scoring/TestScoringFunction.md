The TestScoringFunction class is a scoring function used for testing purposes in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this class is to provide a dummy scoring function that always returns a score of tweetId/10000.0. This function is used to test the score_filter operator, which requires all scores to be between 0 and 1. Therefore, if this function is used with the score_filter operator, tweet ids larger than 10000 should not be used in testing.

The TestScoringFunction class extends the ScoringFunction class and overrides its methods. The score() method calculates the score for each tweet by dividing the tweet ID by 10000.0 and returns the score. The doExplain() method returns null, and the getResultMetadata() method returns the ThriftSearchResultMetadata object. The updateRelevanceStats() method does not do anything.

The ThriftSearchResultMetadata object is used to store the metadata of the search results. The getResultMetadata() method creates a new ThriftSearchResultMetadata object if it does not exist and sets its result type to ThriftSearchResultType.RELEVANCE. It also sets the Penguin version and the score of the metadata object. The score is set to the score calculated in the score() method.

Overall, the TestScoringFunction class is a simple scoring function used for testing purposes in The Algorithm from Twitter project. It provides a dummy score for each tweet and stores the metadata of the search results. This class can be used in conjunction with the score_filter operator to test the relevance of search results. 

Example usage:

```
// create a new instance of TestScoringFunction
TestScoringFunction testScoringFunction = new TestScoringFunction(schema);

// get the score for a tweet
float score = testScoringFunction.score(luceneQueryScore);

// get the result metadata
ThriftSearchResultMetadata metadata = testScoringFunction.getResultMetadata(options);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a dummy scoring function for testing purposes in the context of a search relevance scoring system.
   
2. What is the expected range of scores for this scoring function?
   - The score is always tweetId/10000.0, so the expected range of scores is [0, 1] since the score_filter operator requires all scores to be between [0, 1].

3. What is the purpose of the `getResultMetadata` method?
   - The `getResultMetadata` method returns metadata about the search result, including the result type and score, which can be used for further processing or display.
