The `ScoringFunctionProvider` class is part of the Earlybird project from Twitter and provides a way to return a scoring function for a particular experiment ID. This class can be used for A/B testing of different scoring formulas. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to get a scoring function based on the experiment ID. The scoring function is used to score search results based on their relevance to the query.

The `ScoringFunctionProvider` class is an abstract class that provides an interface for getting a scoring function. The `getScoringFunction()` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by any subclass of `ScoringFunctionProvider`. The `NamedScoringFunctionProvider` is a subclass of `ScoringFunctionProvider` that provides a way to get a scoring function by name. The `getScoringFunctionProviderByName()` method returns a `NamedScoringFunctionProvider` based on the name passed to it. The `DefaultScoringFunctionProvider` is another subclass of `ScoringFunctionProvider` that provides a default scoring function based on the type of scoring function requested.

## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code provides scoring functions for different types of search queries in the Earlybird project from Twitter. It can be used for a/b testing of different scoring formulas and provides fallback behavior if model-based scoring function fails.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries including SLF4J, Thrift, and TensorFlow.

3. What is the difference between ScoringFunctionProvider and NamedScoringFunctionProvider?
- ScoringFunctionProvider is an abstract class that provides a method for returning a scoring function, while NamedScoringFunctionProvider is a subclass of ScoringFunctionProvider that is used for scoring functions that don't throw a ClientException. It provides a method for returning a scoring function without the ClientException parameter.
