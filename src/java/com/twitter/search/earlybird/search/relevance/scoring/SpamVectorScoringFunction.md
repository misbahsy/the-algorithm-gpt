The `SpamVectorScoringFunction` class is a scoring function used for determining the relevance of search results in the context of Twitter. It extends the `ScoringFunction` class and overrides its `score` method to implement the specific logic for spam detection. 

The purpose of this class is to assign a score to each search result based on its likelihood of being spam. The score is used to rank the search results in order of relevance, with the most relevant results appearing at the top of the list. 

The `score` method first checks if the search result is from a verified account, in which case it is considered not spam and assigned a score of 0.5. If the search result contains a non-media non-news link, it is considered a definite spam vector and assigned a score of -0.5. If the search result has enough engagements (retweets, replies, and favorites), it is not marked as spam and assigned a score of 0.5. Otherwise, it is considered spam and assigned a score of -0.5. 

The `SpamVectorScoringFunction` class is used in the larger project to improve the relevance of search results by filtering out spam. It is one of several scoring functions used in combination to rank search results based on various factors such as recency, popularity, and relevance. 

Example usage:

```
ImmutableSchemaInterface schema = new EarlybirdSchema();
SpamVectorScoringFunction spamVectorScoringFunction = new SpamVectorScoringFunction(schema);
float score = spamVectorScoringFunction.score(luceneQueryScore);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
   - This code is a scoring function for determining whether a tweet is spam or not based on various features. It is likely used in a larger search or filtering algorithm for Twitter data.
2. What are the specific features that are used to determine whether a tweet is spam or not?
   - The code uses features such as whether the tweet contains a non-media non-news link, the user's reputation score (tweepcred), and the number of retweets, replies, and favorites the tweet has received.
3. What is the significance of the `ENGAGEMENTS_NO_FILTER` constant and how is it used in the code?
   - `ENGAGEMENTS_NO_FILTER` is the engagement threshold that prevents tweets with low engagement from being filtered as spam. It is used to check whether the sum of retweets, replies, and favorites for a tweet is greater than or equal to this threshold, and if so, the tweet is not marked as spam.
