The `RelevanceSearchResults` class is a subclass of `SimpleSearchResults` and is used to store search results along with their relevance statistics. It contains an array of `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` objects, which are used to store metadata about each search result. The class also has a `relevanceStats` field, which is a `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` object that stores the relevance statistics for the search results. Additionally, there is a `scoringTimeNanos` field that stores the time it took to score the search results.

The `RelevanceSearchResults` class has a constructor that takes an integer `size` parameter, which is used to initialize the size of the `hits` array in the superclass `SimpleSearchResults`. The `resultMetadata` array is also initialized to the same size as `hits`.

The class has a `setHit` method that takes a `Hit` object and an integer `hitIndex` parameter. This method sets the `hit` object at the specified index in the `hits` array and sets the corresponding `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object in the `resultMetadata` array.

The `setRelevanceStats` method takes a `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` object and sets the `relevanceStats` field to this object. The `getRelevanceStats` method returns the `relevanceStats` field.

The `setScoringTimeNanos` method takes a `long` parameter `scoringTimeNanos` and sets the `scoringTimeNanos` field to this value. The `getScoringTimeNanos` method returns the `scoringTimeNanos` field.

This class is used to store search results along with their relevance statistics. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to perform search queries and analyze the results. For example, the `RelevanceSearchResults` class could be used in a search engine to store search results and their relevance statistics, which could then be used to improve the search algorithm. 

Example usage:

```
RelevanceSearchResults results = new RelevanceSearchResults(10);
Hit hit1 = new Hit();
// set hit1 properties
results.setHit(hit1, 0);
// set relevance statistics for results
ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats relevanceStats = new ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats();
// set relevanceStats properties
results.setRelevanceStats(relevanceStats);
// set scoring time for results
long scoringTimeNanos = 1000000000;
results.setScoringTimeNanos(scoringTimeNanos);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how does it relate to the overall project?
   - This class is a subclass of `SimpleSearchResults` and is used to store search results along with their relevance statistics and metadata. It is likely used in the search functionality of the project.
   
2. What is the significance of the `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` and `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` classes?
   - These classes are used to store metadata and relevance statistics for search results in a Thrift format. They are likely used to standardize the format of the data across the project.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `setScoringTimeNanos` and `getScoringTimeNanos` methods?
   - These methods are used to set and retrieve the amount of time it took to score the search results in nanoseconds. This information could be useful for performance analysis and optimization.
