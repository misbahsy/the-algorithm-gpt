The ScoringFunction class defines a ranking function that computes the score of a document that matches a query. It is an abstract class that provides methods for setting up the reader, computing the score for a hit, and returning an explanation for a hit. It also provides methods for collecting features and CSFs for the current document and updating the relevance statistics for a list of hits.

The class has a constructor that takes an ImmutableSchemaInterface object as a parameter. The schema object is used to retrieve the tweet IDs and creation times associated with scored doc IDs, as well as the values for various CSFs.

The setNextReader() method updates the reader that will be used to retrieve the tweet IDs and creation times associated with scored doc IDs, as well as the values for various CSFs. It should be called every time the searcher starts searching in a new segment.

The score() method computes the score for the current hit. It takes the internal ID of the matching hit and the score that Lucene's text query computed for this hit as parameters. It calls the setCurrentDocID() method to update the current document ID and advances all NumericDocValues to this doc ID. It then calls the score() method, which is implemented by subclasses, to compute the score for the hit.

The explain() method returns an explanation for the given hit. It takes an IndexReader object, the internal ID of the matching hit, and the score that Lucene's text query computed for this hit as parameters. It calls the setNextReader() method to update the reader and the setCurrentDocID() method to update the current document ID. It then calls the doExplain() method, which is implemented by subclasses, to return an explanation for the hit.

The getResultMetadata() method returns the scoring metadata for the current doc ID. It takes a ThriftSearchResultMetadataOptions object as a parameter and returns a ThriftSearchResultMetadata object.

The updateRelevanceStats() method updates the given ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats instance based on the scoring metadata for the current doc ID. It is implemented by subclasses.

The batchScore() method scores a list of hits. It is not implemented in this class and throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

The collectFeatures() method collects the features and CSFs for the current document. It takes the score that Lucene's text query computed for this hit as a parameter and returns a Pair object containing a LinearScoringData object and a ThriftSearchResultFeatures object. It is not implemented in this class and throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

The populateResultMetadataBasedOnScoringData() method populates the result metadata based on the given scoring data. It takes a ThriftSearchResultMetadataOptions object, a ThriftSearchResultMetadata object, and a LinearScoringData object as parameters. It is implemented by subclasses.

The getScoringDataForCurrentDocument() method returns the scoring data for the current document. It is not implemented in this class and returns null by default. It should only be called at hit collection time because it relies on the internal doc ID.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a ranking function that computes the score of a document that matches a query.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as Google Guava, Apache Lucene, and Twitter Common Collections.

3. What is the significance of the `SKIP_HIT` constant and why is it set to `-Float.MAX_VALUE`?
- The `SKIP_HIT` constant is used to indicate that a hit should be scored below all. It is set to `-Float.MAX_VALUE` because it is a constant that is not in the valid score range, which allows for float equality tests to be turned into `Math.abs(...) < EPSILON` tests.
