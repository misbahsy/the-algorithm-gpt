The `ModelBasedScoringFunction` class is a scoring function that uses the scoring models specified from the request. It extends the `FeatureBasedScoringFunction` class and overrides its `computeScore` and `generateExplanationForScoring` methods. 

The purpose of this class is to compute the score of a document based on the selected models and their weights. The selected models are specified in the `ThriftRankingParams` object passed to the constructor. The `ScoringModelsManager` is used to retrieve the models by name. The selected models are stored in an array of `SelectedModel` objects, which contain the name, weight, and model of each selected model. 

The `computeScore` method computes the score of a document by iterating over the selected models and accumulating their scores. If the models are schema-based, the `SchemaBasedScoreAccumulator` is used to compute the score based on the document features. Otherwise, the `LegacyScoreAccumulator` is used to compute the score based on the `LinearScoringData` object. The `useLogitScore` flag is used to determine whether to use the logit score or the raw score. 

The `generateExplanationForScoring` method generates an explanation for the computed score. It first computes the score for each selected model and adds an explanation for each one. Then, it adds an explanation for the total model-based score. 

Overall, this class is used to compute the relevance score of a document based on the selected models and their weights. It is part of a larger project that involves searching and ranking documents based on various criteria. 

Example usage:

```
ModelBasedScoringFunction scoringFunction = new ModelBasedScoringFunction(
    schema, searchQuery, antiGamingFilter, searchResultType, userTable, scoringModelsManager);
double score = scoringFunction.computeScore(linearScoringData, false);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a scoring function for a search algorithm that uses selected models to compute relevance scores for search results.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several classes from external libraries, including Google Guava, Apache Lucene, and Thrift.

3. What is the difference between schema-based and legacy models in this code?
- Schema-based models use a predefined schema to extract features from search results, while legacy models use a custom feature extraction process. The code checks for mixed model types and throws an error if they are used together.
