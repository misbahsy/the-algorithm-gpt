The `SearchRequestInfo` class is part of the Earlybird search package of the Twitter search project. This class is responsible for storing information about a search request, such as the search query, the Lucene query, the number of results requested, and the maximum number of hits to process. It also stores information about the metadata options to collect for each result, such as the conversation ID, result location, in-reply-to status ID, referenced tweet author ID, from user ID, and exclusive conversation author ID. 

The `SearchRequestInfo` class has several methods to get and set the stored information, such as `getSearchQuery()`, `getLuceneQuery()`, `getNumResultsRequested()`, `getMaxHitsToProcess()`, `isCollectConversationId()`, `isCollectResultLocation()`, `isGetInReplyToStatusId()`, `isGetReferenceAuthorId()`, `isCollectExclusiveConversationAuthorId()`, `getIdTimeRanges()`, `getTimestamp()`, `getTerminationTracker()`, `getHitAttributeHelper()`, `setHitAttributeHelper()`, `getFacetFieldNames()`, and `isGetFromUserId()`. 

The `SearchRequestInfo` class also has a constructor that takes a `ThriftSearchQuery` object, a Lucene query, and a termination tracker object. It initializes the stored information based on the input parameters. There is also another constructor that takes an additional quality factor object. 

The `SearchRequestInfo` class has a protected method called `calculateMaxHitsToProcess()` that calculates the maximum number of hits to process for a given search query. This method can be overridden by subclasses to compute a different value for the maximum number of hits to process. 

Overall, the `SearchRequestInfo` class is an important part of the Earlybird search package of the Twitter search project. It stores information about a search request and provides methods to get and set the stored information. It also has a method to calculate the maximum number of hits to process for a given search query.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `SearchRequestInfo` that contains information about a search request, such as the search query, the number of results requested, and whether certain metadata should be collected.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries, including Guava and Apache Lucene.

3. What is the significance of the `calculateMaxHitsToProcess` method?
- This method calculates the maximum number of search hits to process for a given search query. It can be overridden by subclasses to compute a different value.
