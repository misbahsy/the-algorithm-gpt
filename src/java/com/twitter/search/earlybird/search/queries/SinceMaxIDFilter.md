The `SinceMaxIDFilter` class is used to filter tweet IDs based on the `since_id` and `max_id` parameters. The `since_id` parameter is exclusive, meaning that tweets with an ID equal to or greater than the specified ID will be excluded from the results. The `max_id` parameter is inclusive, meaning that tweets with an ID equal to or less than the specified ID will be included in the results. 

The class provides three static methods to create queries based on the `since_id` and `max_id` parameters: `getSinceMaxIDQuery`, `getSinceIDQuery`, and `getMaxIDQuery`. These methods return a `BooleanQuery` that includes a `SinceMaxIDFilter` query with the appropriate parameters. 

The `SinceMaxIDFilter` class extends the `Query` class and overrides the `createWeight` method to return a `DefaultFilterWeight` object. The `getDocIdSetIterator` method of this object returns a `SinceMaxIDDocIdSetIterator` object, which is used to iterate over the tweet IDs in the Lucene index and filter out those that do not match the `since_id` and `max_id` parameters. 

The `SinceMaxIDDocIdSetIterator` class extends the `RangeFilterDISI` class and overrides the `shouldReturnDoc` method to check if the tweet ID of the current document is within the specified range. It also includes methods to find the document ID of the tweet with the specified `since_id` and `max_id` parameters. 

Overall, the `SinceMaxIDFilter` class is an important component of the search functionality in the larger project. It allows users to filter tweets based on their ID, which is a common use case in Twitter search. The class is used to create queries that are executed against the Lucene index, and it provides an efficient way to filter out tweets that do not match the specified parameters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SinceMaxIDFilter` class?
- The `SinceMaxIDFilter` class is used to filter tweet IDs based on the `since_id` and `max_id` parameters.

2. What is the significance of the `NO_FILTER` constant?
- The `NO_FILTER` constant is used to indicate that there is no filter applied for either `since_id` or `max_id`.

3. What is the purpose of the `SinceMaxIDDocIdSetIterator` class?
- The `SinceMaxIDDocIdSetIterator` class is used to iterate over the document IDs that match the `since_id` and `max_id` filters, and return a null iterator if there are no matches.
