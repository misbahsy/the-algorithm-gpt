The `ExpandedUrlCollector` class is a collector for collecting expanded URLs from facets. It is used in the larger project to extract URLs from tweets and store them in a search index. The class extends the `AbstractFacetTermCollector` class and overrides its methods to implement the functionality of collecting URLs from facets.

The `ExpandedUrlCollector` class has a `dedupedUrls` field that is a `Map` of `String` URLs to `ThriftSearchResultUrl` objects. The `collect` method is called for each document in the search index and it extracts the URL from the facet and adds it to the `dedupedUrls` map. The `fillResultAndClear` method is called after all documents have been processed and it sets the tweet URLs in the `ThriftSearchResult` object to the expanded URLs in the `dedupedUrls` map.

The `ExpandedUrlCollector` class has a `getMediaType` method that takes a facet name and returns the corresponding `MediaTypes` enum. The `MediaTypes` enum is used to set the media type of the URL in the `ThriftSearchResultUrl` object.

The `ExpandedUrlCollector` class has a `getTermFromProvider` method that takes a facet name, term ID, and `FacetLabelProvider` object and returns the URL for the term. The method checks if the facet name is `TWIMG_FACET` and if so, extracts the media URL from the term payload. Otherwise, it extracts the URL from the term text.

The `ExpandedUrlCollector` class has a `FACET_CONTAINS_URL` field that is a set of facet names that contain URLs. The `collect` method checks if the facet name is in the `FACET_CONTAINS_URL` set and if so, extracts the URL from the facet.

The `ExpandedUrlCollector` class has a `getExpandedUrls` method that returns a list of the `ThriftSearchResultUrl` objects in the `dedupedUrls` map. The method is marked as `@VisibleForTesting` to indicate that it is only used for testing purposes.

Example usage:

```
ExpandedUrlCollector collector = new ExpandedUrlCollector();
collector.collect(docID, termID, fieldID);
ThriftSearchResult result = new ThriftSearchResult();
collector.fillResultAndClear(result);
List<ThriftSearchResultUrl> urls = collector.getExpandedUrls();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a collector for collecting expanded URLs from facets.

2. What are the input and output of the `collect` method?
- The input of the `collect` method is an integer `docID`, a long `termID`, and an integer `fieldID`. The output of the `collect` method is a boolean value.

3. What is the purpose of the `getMediaType` method?
- The purpose of the `getMediaType` method is to get the Spiderduck media type for a given facet name.
