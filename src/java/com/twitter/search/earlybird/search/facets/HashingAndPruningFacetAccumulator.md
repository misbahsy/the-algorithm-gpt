The `HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator` class is responsible for accumulating and managing facets in the Twitter search algorithm. Facets are used to categorize and filter search results based on specific attributes, such as language or user information. This class extends the `FacetAccumulator` class and provides additional functionality for hashing, pruning, and sorting facets.

The class uses a custom `HashTable` implementation to store facets, with each entry consisting of 4 long values: termID, simpleCount, weightedCount, and a payload containing penaltyCount and maxTweepcred. The `HashTable` also has a `Cursor` class to access and modify the fields of a hash entry.

The `HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator` class provides methods to add facets, record language information, and retrieve top facets based on specific sorting criteria. The `add` method is used to add a new facet or update an existing one, while the `recordLanguage` method updates the language histogram. The `getTopFacets` method returns the top N facets based on the specified sorting criteria, such as weighted count or simple count.

The class also provides a `FacetComparator` class to compare facets based on different sorting criteria. There are two predefined comparators: `SIMPLE_COUNT_COMPARATOR` and `WEIGHTED_COUNT_COMPARATOR`. The `getComparator` method returns the appropriate comparator based on the specified `ThriftFacetEarlybirdSortingMode`.

Example usage:

```java
FacetLabelProvider facetLabelProvider = ...;
FacetComparator comparator = HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator.getComparator(ThriftFacetEarlybirdSortingMode.SORT_BY_WEIGHTED_COUNT);
HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator accumulator = new HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator(facetLabelProvider, comparator);

accumulator.add(termID, weightedCounterIncrement, penaltyIncrement, tweepCred);
accumulator.recordLanguage(languageId);

ThriftFacetFieldResults topFacets = accumulator.getTopFacets(numRequested);
```

In summary, the `HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator` class is a key component in the Twitter search algorithm for managing and retrieving facets based on specific sorting criteria. It provides efficient hashing, pruning, and sorting mechanisms to ensure optimal performance in large-scale search scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator` class?**

   The `HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator` class is responsible for accumulating and managing facets (categorical data) in a search result. It uses a hash table to store the facets and provides methods to add, reset, and retrieve facets, as well as to record language information and prune the hash table when it reaches a certain load factor.

2. **How does the `prune()` method work and when is it called?**

   The `prune()` method is called when the number of items in the hash table reaches the maximum load factor. It is responsible for removing the least significant entries from the hash table and rehashing the remaining entries. The method first copies the hash table entries to a sort buffer, then iterates through the entries, evicting those with a count below a certain threshold, and finally rehashes the remaining entries back into the hash table.

3. **How does the `FacetComparator` class work and what are its use cases?**

   The `FacetComparator` class is used to compare facets based on their weighted count, simple count, and penalty count. It provides two static instances, `SIMPLE_COUNT_COMPARATOR` and `WEIGHTED_COUNT_COMPARATOR`, which prioritize simple count and weighted count, respectively. The class also provides methods to get the appropriate comparator for a given sorting mode, either in the default or reverse order. This is useful when sorting facets in different ways, such as when retrieving the top facets from the accumulator.
