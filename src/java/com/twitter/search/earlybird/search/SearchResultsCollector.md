The `SearchResultsCollector` class is responsible for collecting results for Recency queries and delegating them to collectors based on query mode. This class extends the `AbstractResultsCollector` class and overrides its methods to implement the specific functionality required for Recency queries.

The `SearchResultsCollector` constructor takes in several parameters, including an `ImmutableSchemaInterface` object, a `SearchRequestInfo` object, a `Clock` object, an `EarlybirdSearcherStats` object, an `EarlybirdCluster` object, a `UserTable` object, and an integer representing the request debug mode. These parameters are used to initialize the `results` list, `requestedFeatureIds` set, `cluster` object, and `userTable` object.

The `startSegment()` method sets the `featuresRequested` flag to `true` if `requestedFeatureIds` is not null.

The `doCollect()` method is called for each tweet that matches the search query. It creates a `Hit` object with the current time slice ID and tweet ID, and sets the `metadata` object for the hit. The `metadata` object is a `ThriftSearchResultMetadata` object that contains information about the tweet, such as its language, whether it is a retweet or reply, and whether it is nullcast. The `metadata` object is populated with data from the `documentFeatures` object, which is an instance of `ThriftSearchResultFeatures` that contains the features of the tweet. The `metadata` object is also populated with data from the `cluster` object and `userTable` object.

The `collectRetweetAndReplyMetadata()` method is called to collect retweet and reply metadata for the tweet. If the `searchRequestInfo` object has the `isGetInReplyToStatusId()` flag set, the shared status ID is stored in the `metadata` object if the tweet is a reply or retweet. If the `searchRequestInfo` object has the `isGetReferenceAuthorId()` flag set, the reference tweet author ID is stored in the `metadata` object if the tweet is a reply or retweet.

The `innerShouldCollectMore()` method checks whether enough results have been collected and sets the `TERMINATED_COLLECTED_ENOUGH_RESULTS` flag if necessary.

The `doGetResults()` method sorts the `results` list by tweet ID and returns a `SimpleSearchResults` object containing the sorted list.

Overall, the `SearchResultsCollector` class is an important component of the Recency query functionality in the larger project. It collects and organizes the search results and delegates them to collectors based on query mode.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SearchResultsCollector` class?
- The `SearchResultsCollector` class collects results for Recency queries for delegation to collectors based on query mode.

2. What are the parameters passed to the constructor of the `SearchResultsCollector` class?
- The parameters passed to the constructor of the `SearchResultsCollector` class are `ImmutableSchemaInterface schema`, `SearchRequestInfo searchRequestInfo`, `Clock clock`, `EarlybirdSearcherStats searcherStats`, `EarlybirdCluster cluster`, `UserTable userTable`, and `int requestDebugMode`.

3. What is the purpose of the `doCollect` method in the `SearchResultsCollector` class?
- The `doCollect` method in the `SearchResultsCollector` class collects a hit and its metadata, including tweet language, hit attribution data, nullcast flag, conversation ID, result geo-location, retweet and reply metadata, search result features, and whether the tweet is protected.
