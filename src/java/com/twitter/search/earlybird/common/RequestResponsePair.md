The `RequestResponsePair` class is a simple data structure that holds information related to a search request and its corresponding response. It contains four fields: `request`, `response`, `luceneQuery`, and `finalSerializedQuery`. 

The `request` field is an instance of the `EarlybirdRequest` class, which represents the original search request. The `response` field is an instance of the `EarlybirdResponse` class, which represents the response to the search request. The `luceneQuery` field is an instance of the `org.apache.lucene.search.Query` class, which represents the Lucene query that was used to perform the search. Finally, the `finalSerializedQuery` field is an instance of the `com.twitter.search.queryparser.query.Query` class, which represents the serialized query in its final form, after various modifications have been applied to it.

The `RequestResponsePair` class provides getter methods for each of its fields. The `getFinalSerializedQuery()` method returns the serialized query in its final form, or "N/A" if it is null. The `getRequest()` method returns the original search request. The `getResponse()` method returns the response to the search request. Finally, the `getLuceneQuery()` method returns the Lucene query that was used to perform the search.

This class is likely used in the larger project to represent a single search request and its corresponding response, which can be useful for logging, debugging, or other analysis purposes. For example, if the search results are not what was expected, this class could be used to examine the original search request and the Lucene query that was used to perform the search, in order to identify any issues or bugs in the search algorithm.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the larger project?
   - This class represents a pair of request and response objects along with a Lucene query and a serialized query. It is likely used to store and manipulate search queries and their results in the Earlybird search system.
2. What is the significance of the `finalSerializedQuery` field and why might it be null in some cases?
   - The `finalSerializedQuery` field represents the serialized form of the search query after modifications have been applied to it. It may be null in some cases where certain code paths are not triggered in production.
3. What is the relationship between the `luceneQuery` field and the `Query` class imported from `org.apache.lucene.search`?
   - The `luceneQuery` field is an instance of the `Query` class from the Lucene search library. It is likely used to execute the search query and retrieve results.
