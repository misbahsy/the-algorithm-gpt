The `UserTableBuilderFromSnapshot` class is responsible for building a user table from a user safety snapshot on HDFS. The class reads the user safety snapshot from HDFS, processes the data, and builds a user table. The user table is built by iterating through the user safety snapshot and inserting each user into the table. The user table is a data structure that stores information about each user, such as whether they are antisocial, NSFW, or protected. 

The `build` method is the main method of the class. It takes a `Predicate<Long>` as input, which is used to filter the users that are inserted into the user table. The method returns an `Optional<UserTable>`, which contains the user table if it was successfully built, or an empty `Optional` if something went wrong. 

The `setSnapshotPath` method sets the paths for the user safety snapshot data and metadata. The data path is used to read the user safety snapshot, and the metadata path is used to read the timestamp of the last update. 

The `getUserUpdates` method reads the user safety snapshot from HDFS and returns a `Stream<UserUpdate>`. The `UserUpdate` class is a private class that represents a user update. The `getUserUpdates` method uses a `LzoThriftBlockFileReader` to read the user safety snapshot. The `LzoThriftBlockFileReader` reads the snapshot in blocks and returns a `SafetyUserState` object for each user. The `getUserUpdates` method converts each `SafetyUserState` object to a `UserUpdate` object and returns a stream of `UserUpdate` objects. 

The `readTimestampOfLastSeenUpdateFromSnapshot` method reads the timestamp of the last update from the user safety snapshot metadata. The timestamp is stored in a file in the metadata directory. 

The `insertUser` method inserts a user into the user table. The method takes a `UserUpdate` object as input and inserts the user into the user table if they meet certain criteria. If the user is antisocial, NSFW, or protected, the corresponding bit in the user table is set to true. 

Overall, the `UserTableBuilderFromSnapshot` class is an important part of the larger project because it builds the user table that is used by other parts of the project. The user table is used to filter out users that are not relevant to the project and to identify users that are antisocial, NSFW, or protected. The user table is an important data structure that is used throughout the project. 

Example usage:

```
UserTableBuilderFromSnapshot builder = new UserTableBuilderFromSnapshot();
Predicate<Long> userFilter = userId -> userId % 2 == 0; // Only insert even user IDs
Optional<UserTable> userTable = builder.build(userFilter);
if (userTable.isPresent()) {
  // Use the user table
  UserTable table = userTable.get();
  // ...
} else {
  // Something went wrong
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code builds a user table from a user safety snapshot on HDFS.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as Scalding, Hadoop, and Twitter common internal.

3. What is the input and output of the `build` method?
- The `build` method takes a `Predicate<Long>` as input and returns an `Optional<UserTable>` as output. The `Predicate<Long>` is used to filter the users to be included in the user table, while the `Optional<UserTable>` is the resulting user table if the build process is successful.
