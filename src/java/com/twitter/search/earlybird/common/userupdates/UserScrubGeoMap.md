The `UserScrubGeoMap` class is a thread-safe map that stores information about users who have deleted location data from their tweets. The map is used to filter out tweets that should not be returned to geo queries. 

The map is implemented using a `ConcurrentHashMap`, which is thread-safe without synchronizing the whole map. This means that reads can happen very fast while writes are done with a lock. This is ideal since many Earlybird Searcher threads could be reading from the map at once, whereas we will only be adding to the map via Kafka. 

The class has several methods for interacting with the map. The `indexUserScrubGeoEvent` method is used to add or update an entry in the map. It takes a `UserScrubGeoEvent` object as input, which contains information about the user and the max tweet ID that will eventually be scrubbed from the index. The method ensures that the `max_tweet_id` in the `UserScrubGeoEvent` is greater than the one already stored in the map for the given user id (if any) before updating the entry for this user. This will protect Earlybirds from potential issues where out-of-date `UserScrubGeoEvents` appear in the incoming Kafka stream.

The `isTweetGeoScrubbed` method is used to check whether a tweet should be geo scrubbed. A tweet is geo scrubbed if it is older than the max tweet ID that is scrubbed for the tweet's author. If there is no entry for the tweet's author in the map, then the tweet is not geo scrubbed.

The `computeEventLag` method is used to compute the lag (in milliseconds) from when a `UserScrubGeoEvent` is created until it is applied to the `UserScrubGeoMap`. It takes the `max_tweet_id` found in the current event and converts it to a timestamp. The `max_tweet_id` will give us a timestamp closest to when Tweetypie processes macaw-geo requests.

The class also has several utility methods for getting information about the map, such as `getNumUsersInMap`, `getMap`, `isEmpty`, and `isSet`.

Overall, the `UserScrubGeoMap` class is an important component of the larger project, as it is used to filter out tweets that should not be returned to geo queries. It provides a thread-safe way to store and update information about users who have deleted location data from their tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a thread-safe map of users who have deleted location data from their tweets, which is used to filter out tweets that should not be returned to geo queries. It is part of the Earlybird project's search functionality.

2. How does the `indexUserScrubGeoEvent` method protect against out-of-date `UserScrubGeoEvents`? 
- The method checks that the `max_tweet_id` in the `userScrubGeoEvent` is greater than the one already stored in the map for the given user id (if any) before updating the entry for this user. This ensures that only the most recent `UserScrubGeoEvent` is used to update the map.

3. What is the purpose of the `USER_SCRUB_GEO_EVENT_LAG_STAT` timer? 
- The timer measures the lag (in milliseconds) from when a `UserScrubGeoEvent` is created until it is applied to the `UserScrubGeoMap`. It does this by computing the difference between the current time and the timestamp closest to when Tweetypie processes macaw-geo requests, which is derived from the `maxTweetId` found in the current event.
