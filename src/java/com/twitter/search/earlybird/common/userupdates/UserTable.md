The `UserTable` class in this code is a table containing metadata about users, such as NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or Antisocial status. It is used for result filtering in the larger project. The table is implemented as a hash table with separate arrays for user IDs (`hash`) and their corresponding metadata bits (`bits`). The metadata bits are represented as a byte, where each bit corresponds to a specific user attribute (e.g., Antisocial, Offensive, NSFW, or Protected).

The class provides methods to set and check the metadata bits for a given user ID, such as `setAntisocial`, `setNSFW`, `setOffensive`, and `setIsProtected`. It also provides a method `indexUserUpdate` to add a user update to the table based on the update type (Antisocial, NSFW, Offensive, or Protected).

The `UserTable` class also supports filtering of user IDs based on a given predicate (`userIdFilter`). The `getFlaggedUserIdIterator` method returns an iterator for user IDs that have at least one of the bits set, allowing the caller to iterate over flagged users.

The class maintains various statistics about the table, such as the number of users in the table, the number of users with no bits set, and the number of users with each specific bit set. These statistics are updated whenever the table is modified and can be accessed using methods like `getNumUsersInTable`, `getNumUsersWithNoBitsSet`, and `getSetBitCount`.

The `UserTable` class also supports resizing and rehashing of the hash table when it becomes too full (more than 50% occupied). The `rehash` method is used to create a new hash table with a larger capacity and copy the existing data into it.

Example usage:

```java
UserTable userTable = new UserTable(1024);
userTable.setAntisocial(12345L, true);
userTable.setNSFW(67890L, true);
boolean isAntisocial = userTable.isSet(12345L, UserTable.ANTISOCIAL_BIT);
```

In this example, a new `UserTable` is created with an initial capacity of 1024. The Antisocial bit is set for user ID 12345, and the NSFW bit is set for user ID 67890. The `isSet` method is then used to check if the Antisocial bit is set for user ID 12345.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `UserTable` class and how is it used for result filtering?
   **Answer**: The `UserTable` class is a table containing metadata about users, such as NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or Antisocial status. It is used for filtering search results based on these user attributes.

2. **Question**: How does the `UserTable` handle hash collisions and resizing of the hash table?
   **Answer**: The `UserTable` handles hash collisions using open addressing with a secondary hash function. When the hash table is more than 50% occupied, it resizes the table by doubling its size, up to a maximum capacity.

3. **Question**: What are the different user attributes that can be set in the `UserTable`, and how are they represented?
   **Answer**: The user attributes that can be set in the `UserTable` are Antisocial, Offensive, NSFW (Not Safe For Work), and Protected. These attributes are represented as bits in a byte array, with each attribute corresponding to a specific bit position.
