The `Base64RequestResponseForLogging` class is responsible for logging the requests and responses of the Earlybird service from Twitter. The purpose of this class is to make it easy to re-issue requests in formz to reproduce issues. The class has three types of logs: failed, random, and slow. 

The class uses the Apache Commons Codec library to encode the requests and responses in Base64 format. The `TSerializer` class from the Apache Thrift library is used to serialize the requests and responses. The `asBase64` method is used to serialize the requests and responses and encode them in Base64 format. If the serialization fails, the method returns "failed_to_serialize".

The `getFormattedMessage` method is used to format the log message. It calls the `asBase64` method to get the Base64-encoded request and response. It also clears the `clientRequestTimeMs` field from the request and logs it separately for the rare case it is needed. The method returns a string that contains the log line, the `clientRequestTimeMs`, the Base64-encoded request, and the Base64-encoded response.

The `log` method is used to log the Base64-encoded request and response to the success or failure log. It creates a new object that overrides the `toString` method to return the formatted log message. It then logs the message to the appropriate log based on the log type.

The class has three static factory methods: `randomRequest`, `failedRequest`, and `slowRequest`. These methods are used to create a new instance of the `Base64RequestResponseForLogging` class with the appropriate log type. 

Overall, the `Base64RequestResponseForLogging` class is an important part of the Earlybird service from Twitter as it provides a way to log the requests and responses for debugging and issue resolution.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to log Base64-encoded requests and responses to the success or failure log.

2. Why is TSerializer not threadsafe and what is the solution?
- TSerializer is not threadsafe because it maintains internal state. The solution is to create a new TSerializer for each request.

3. What is the purpose of the LogType enum?
- The LogType enum is used to differentiate between different types of logs (FAILED, RANDOM, and SLOW) and determine which logger to use for each type.
