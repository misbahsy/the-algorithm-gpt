The `ClientIdUtil` class provides utility methods for working with client IDs in the Earlybird project. The purpose of this class is to provide a consistent way of handling client IDs across different parts of the project.

The class defines several constants that are used to format client IDs for different purposes. For example, `CLIENT_ID_PREFIX` is used to prefix client IDs when they are used in stats, while `FINAGLE_CLIENT_ID_AND_CLIENT_ID_PATTERN` is used to combine a Finagle client ID and a client ID into a single string.

The class also defines several methods for working with client IDs. `getClientIdFromRequest` returns the client ID from an `EarlybirdRequest` object, or `UNSET_CLIENT_ID` if the client ID is not set. `getClientIdFromHttpEndpointAttribution` returns the client ID from the Strato http endpoint attribution as an `Optional`. `formatClientId` formats a client ID into a string that can be used for stats. `formatFinagleClientIdAndClientId` formats a Finagle client ID and a client ID into a single string that can be used for stats or other purposes. `formatClientIdAndRequestType` formats a client ID and a request type into a single string that can be used for stats or other purposes. Finally, `getQuotaClientId` formats a client ID for use in quota calculations.

Overall, the `ClientIdUtil` class provides a set of utility methods for working with client IDs in the Earlybird project. These methods are used to ensure that client IDs are handled consistently across different parts of the project, and to provide a way of formatting client IDs for different purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility methods for handling client IDs in the EarlybirdRequest object.

2. What is the significance of the "unset" and "unknown" client IDs?
- An "unset" client ID means that the EarlybirdRequest.clientId field was null, while an "unknown" client ID means that the client that sent the request tried setting EarlybirdRequest.clientId, but couldn't figure out a good value for it.

3. What is the difference between getClientIdFromRequest and getClientIdFromHttpEndpointAttribution methods?
- getClientIdFromRequest returns the ID of the client that initiated the request or UNSET_CLIENT_ID if not set, while getClientIdFromHttpEndpointAttribution returns the Strato http endpoint attribution as an Optional.
