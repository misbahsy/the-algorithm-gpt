The `EarlybirdProperty` class represents an Earlybird property that can be specified by a command line flag. It is a stateless class that is used to create instances of Earlybird properties with different types such as `String`, `Integer`, and `Boolean`. 

The class has a nested `PropertyType` class that defines the different types of Earlybird properties that can be created. Each `PropertyType` has a `Flaggable` object that is used to parse the command line flag value, a `getter` function that retrieves the value of the property from the Earlybird configuration, and a `getterWithDefault` function that retrieves the value of the property from the Earlybird configuration or returns a default value if the property is not set.

The `EarlybirdProperty` class has a list of static final properties that represent the different Earlybird properties that can be specified by a command line flag. Each property has a name, a help message, a `PropertyType`, and two boolean flags that indicate whether the property is required on Aurora or dedicated environments. 

The class has methods to create a flag for each property, get the value of a property, and get the list of all Earlybird properties. It also has a `getServiceIdentifier` method that returns a `ServiceIdentifier` object that represents the Earlybird service identifier based on the `ROLE`, `EARLYBIRD_NAME`, `ENV`, and `ZONE` properties.

This class is used in the larger Earlybird project to define and manage Earlybird properties that can be specified by a command line flag. It provides a convenient way to create and manage Earlybird properties with different types and default values. Developers can use this class to create flags for their Earlybird properties and retrieve their values from the Earlybird configuration.
