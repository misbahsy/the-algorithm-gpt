The code provided is a simple Java class called EarlybirdMain. This class serves as the entry point for the Earlybird project, which is a search engine developed by Twitter. The purpose of this class is to instantiate an object of the Earlybird class and call its main method, which is where the actual search functionality is implemented.

The EarlybirdMain class is declared as final, which means that it cannot be subclassed. It has a private constructor, which means that it cannot be instantiated from outside the class. This is a common pattern used for utility classes or classes that should not be instantiated directly.

The main method of EarlybirdMain takes an array of strings as input, which are the command-line arguments passed to the program. These arguments are then passed to the main method of the Earlybird class, which is responsible for parsing and processing them.

Here is an example of how the EarlybirdMain class can be used:

```
$ java com.twitter.search.earlybird.EarlybirdMain -query "Twitter API"
```

This command will execute the main method of EarlybirdMain, which will create an instance of the Earlybird class and pass the command-line arguments to it. The Earlybird class will then parse the arguments and perform a search for tweets containing the phrase "Twitter API".

Overall, the EarlybirdMain class is a simple utility class that serves as the entry point for the Earlybird project. Its main purpose is to instantiate the Earlybird class and pass command-line arguments to it.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdMain class?
   - The EarlybirdMain class is a final class with a private constructor that serves as the entry point for the Earlybird application.

2. What is the Earlybird class and what does its main method do?
   - The Earlybird class is not shown in this code snippet, but its main method is invoked by the main method of EarlybirdMain, passing in the command line arguments.

3. What is the expected behavior of the Earlybird application?
   - Without additional information, it is unclear what the Earlybird application does or what problem it solves. Further investigation is needed to determine its expected behavior.
