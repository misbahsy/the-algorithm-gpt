The `TierInfoUtil` class provides utility methods for working with `TierInfo` objects, which represent tiers in a data storage system. The `TierInfoUtil` class has a single public method, `checkTierServingRanges`, which checks that the serving ranges and override serving ranges of the given tiers do not overlap and do not have gaps. The method takes a `SortedSet` of `TierInfo` objects as input and throws an exception if any of the checks fail.

The `TierInfoUtil` class also defines a `Comparator` for `TierInfo` objects, which is used to sort the tiers in reverse order based on their data start date. This comparator is defined as a static final field called `TIER_COMPARATOR`.

The `TierInfoUtil` class is likely used in the larger project to ensure that the tiers in the data storage system are properly configured and do not have any overlapping or missing ranges. The `checkTierServingRanges` method is likely called during system initialization or configuration to ensure that the tiers are set up correctly.

Example usage:

```java
SortedSet<TierInfo> tiers = new TreeSet<>(TierInfoUtil.TIER_COMPARATOR);
// add TierInfo objects to the set
TierInfoUtil.checkTierServingRanges(tiers);
// throws an exception if any of the checks fail
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TierInfoUtil` class?
- The `TierInfoUtil` class provides utility methods for working with `TierInfo` objects, including a comparator and a method for checking tier serving ranges.

2. What is the purpose of the `checkTierServingRanges` method?
- The `checkTierServingRanges` method checks that the serving ranges and override serving ranges of the given tiers do not overlap and do not have gaps, with the exception of dark reads tiers.

3. What is the purpose of the `TIER_COMPARATOR` field?
- The `TIER_COMPARATOR` field is a comparator that sorts `TierInfo` objects in reverse order based on their data start date.
