The `TierInfo` class is a representation of the properties of a single tier in the Earlybird project from Twitter. A tier is a partition of the data that is used to serve search queries. The purpose of this class is to provide information about a tier, such as its name, data start and end dates, number of partitions, and maximum timeslices. 

The class also provides information about the serving range of the tier, which is the range of tweets that the tier is responsible for serving. This is represented by the `ServingRange` interface, which is implemented by the `TierInfo` class. The serving range is defined by two endpoints: `servingRangeSince` and `servingRangeMax`. These endpoints are represented by the `TierServingBoundaryEndPoint` class, which is used to create new endpoints based on the tier's data start and end dates, and a tweet ID or date override.

The `TierInfo` class also provides information about the read type of the tier, which is used to determine how search queries are handled. There are three read types: light, dark, and grey. Light reads are used for normal search queries, where the results are returned to the user. Dark reads are used for testing purposes, where the results are discarded. Grey reads are used for performance testing, where the results are returned but then discarded.

The `TierInfo` class is used by other classes in the Earlybird project to configure and manage the tiers. For example, the `TierConfig` class uses `TierInfo` objects to create and manage the tiers. The `TierInfo` class is also used by the `TierServingInfo` class to provide information about the serving range of the tier.

Example usage:

```java
// Create a new TierInfo object
TierInfo tierInfo = new TierInfo("tier1", new Date(0), new Date(), 10, 100, true,
    "sinceIdString", "maxIdString", null, null, RequestReadType.LIGHT, RequestReadType.LIGHT, new Clock());

// Get the name of the tier
String tierName = tierInfo.getTierName();

// Get the start date of the tier's data
Date dataStartDate = tierInfo.getDataStartDate();

// Get the read type of the tier
RequestReadType readType = tierInfo.getReadType();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TierInfo` class?
- The `TierInfo` class defines the properties of a single tier and implements the `ServingRange` interface.

2. What is the significance of the `RequestReadType` enum?
- The `RequestReadType` enum defines the type of read to be performed on a tier, which can be light, dark, or grey.

3. What is the purpose of the `Clock` parameter in the constructor?
- The `Clock` parameter is used to provide a clock instance for creating `TierServingBoundaryEndPoint` objects, which are used to define the serving range of a tier.
