The `TierServingBoundaryEndPoint` class is used to represent the start or end boundary of a tier's serving range. It is used to add since_id and max_id operators onto search queries. The class has three fields: `offsetToCurrentTimeMillis`, `absoluteTweetId`, and `timeBoundarySecondsFromEpoch`. Either `offsetToCurrentTimeMillis` is set or `absoluteTweetId` and `timeBoundarySecondsFromEpoch` are set. The `clock` field is used to obtain the current time when `relative_to_current_time_ms` is used. 

The `newTierServingBoundaryEndPoint` method is used to parse the boundary string and construct a `TierServingBoundaryEndPoint` instance. The `boundaryString` parameter is the boundary configuration string. Valid values are: `inferred_from_data_range`, `absolute_tweet_id_and_timestamp_millis:id:timestamp`, and `relative_to_current_time_ms:offset`. The `boundaryDate` parameter is the data boundary. This is used in conjunction with `inferred_from_data_date` to determine the serving boundary. The `clock` parameter is used to obtain the current time when `relative_to_current_time_ms` is used. 

The `inferBoundaryFromDataRange` method is used to infer the serving range from the data range. This only works after Nov 2010 when Twitter switched to snowflake IDs. The `getRelativeBoundary` method is used to add an offset onto the current timestamp in millis to compute the serving range. 

The `getBoundaryTweetId` method returns the tweet ID for this tier boundary. If the tier boundary was created using a tweet ID, that tweet ID is returned. Otherwise, a tweet ID is derived from the time boundary. The `getBoundaryTimeSecondsFromEpoch` method returns the time boundary for this tier boundary, in seconds since epoch. 

Overall, this class is an important part of the larger project as it is used to add since_id and max_id operators onto search queries. It is used to represent the start or end boundary of a tier's serving range.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TierServingBoundaryEndPoint` class?
- The `TierServingBoundaryEndPoint` class is used to add `since_id` and `max_id` operators onto search queries.

2. What are the valid values for the `boundaryString` parameter in the `newTierServingBoundaryEndPoint` method?
- The valid values for the `boundaryString` parameter are: 
  - `"inferred_from_data_range"` which infers the serving range from the data range.
  - `"absolute_tweet_id_and_timestamp_millis:id:timestamp"` which gives a tweet ID/timestamp explicitly as the serving range boundary.
  - `"relative_to_current_time_ms:offset"` which adds an offset onto the current timestamp in millis to compute the serving range.

3. What is the purpose of the `getBoundaryTweetId` method?
- The `getBoundaryTweetId` method returns the tweet ID for this tier boundary. If the tier boundary was created using a tweet ID, that tweet ID is returned. Otherwise, a tweet ID is derived from the time boundary.
