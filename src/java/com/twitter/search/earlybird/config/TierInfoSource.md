The `TierInfoSource` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for retrieving information about the different tiers of the system. The class has a constructor that takes an instance of `ZooKeeperProxy` as a parameter and initializes the `zkClient` field with it. The `ZooKeeperProxy` class is a utility class that provides a simplified interface for interacting with ZooKeeper, a distributed coordination service.

The `TierInfoSource` class has two public methods: `getTierInformation()` and `getConfigFileType()`. The `getTierInformation()` method returns a list of `TierInfo` objects, which contain information about the different tiers of the system. The `getConfigFileType()` method returns the name of the configuration file used by the system.

The `getTierInformation()` method calls the private method `getTierInfoWithPrefix()` with the prefix "tier". The `getTierInfoWithPrefix()` method retrieves the names of all the tiers using the `TierConfig.getTierNames()` method and filters out the ones that do not start with the prefix "tier". For each tier that matches the prefix, it retrieves the `TierInfo` object using the `TierConfig.getTierInfo()` method and adds it to a list. The list of `TierInfo` objects is then returned.

This class can be used by other classes in the project to retrieve information about the different tiers of the system. For example, a class responsible for load balancing could use the `getTierInformation()` method to retrieve information about the different tiers and distribute the load accordingly. Another class responsible for logging could use the `getConfigFileType()` method to retrieve the name of the configuration file and use it to configure the logging system.

Example usage:

```
ZooKeeperProxy zkClient = new ZooKeeperProxy("localhost:2181");
TierInfoSource tierInfoSource = new TierInfoSource(zkClient);
List<TierInfo> tierInfos = tierInfoSource.getTierInformation();
String configFileType = tierInfoSource.getConfigFileType();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `TierInfoSource` that retrieves information about tiers from a ZooKeeper server.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the `ZooKeeperProxy` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.util.zookeeper` package, as well as the `TierConfig` and `TierInfo` classes (which are not shown in this code snippet).

3. What is the expected output of calling the `getTierInformation()` method?
   - The `getTierInformation()` method returns a list of `TierInfo` objects for all tiers with names starting with "tier".
