The `TierInfoWrapper` class is a simple wrapper around `TierInfo` that returns either the "real" or the "overridden" values from the given `TierInfo` instance, based on the given `useOverrideTierConfig` flag. This class implements the `ServingRange` interface, which defines methods for getting information about the serving range of a tier.

The `TierInfoWrapper` constructor takes a `TierInfo` instance and a boolean flag indicating whether to use the overridden values or not. The class provides getter methods for various properties of the `TierInfo` instance, such as the tier name, data start and end dates, number of partitions, maximum timeslices, and so on. Additionally, there are methods for getting the read type and serving range of the tier, which may be overridden if the `useOverrideTierConfig` flag is set to true.

The `servingRangesOverlap` and `servingRangesHaveGap` methods are static utility methods that take two `TierInfoWrapper` instances and return a boolean indicating whether the serving ranges of the two tiers overlap or have a gap between them, respectively.

This class is likely used in the larger project to provide a way to access and manipulate the properties of a `TierInfo` instance, while also allowing for the possibility of overriding certain properties. The `ServingRange` interface is likely used elsewhere in the project to define the serving range of a tier, and the `servingRangesOverlap` and `servingRangesHaveGap` methods may be used to check for conflicts or gaps between the serving ranges of different tiers. 

Example usage:

```
TierInfo tierInfo = new TierInfo("tier1", new Date(0), new Date(), 1, 10, TierConfig.ConfigSource.DEFAULT, true, TierInfo.RequestReadType.DARK, 0, 100, 0, 1000);
TierInfoWrapper wrapper = new TierInfoWrapper(tierInfo, true);
System.out.println(wrapper.getTierName()); // prints "tier1"
System.out.println(wrapper.getMaxTimeslices()); // prints 10
System.out.println(wrapper.getReadType()); // prints TierInfo.RequestReadType.DARK
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `TierInfoWrapper` that wraps around `TierInfo` and returns either the "real" or "overridden" values based on a flag. It also defines some methods to get and set various properties of the `TierInfo` instance.

2. What is the `ServingRange` interface and how is it used in this code?
    
    The `ServingRange` interface is implemented by the `TierInfoWrapper` class, which means that any instance of `TierInfoWrapper` can be treated as a `ServingRange`. This allows other parts of the codebase to use `TierInfoWrapper` objects interchangeably with other objects that implement the `ServingRange` interface.

3. What is the purpose of the `servingRangesOverlap` and `servingRangesHaveGap` methods?
    
    These methods are used to compare two `TierInfoWrapper` objects and determine whether their serving ranges overlap or have a gap between them. This is useful for determining how to split up data processing tasks between different tiers.
