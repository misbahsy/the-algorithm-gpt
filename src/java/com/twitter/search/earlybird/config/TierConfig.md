The `TierConfig` class provides APIs to access the tier configurations for a cluster. Each tier has a tier name, number of partitions, tier start time, and end time. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is likely a search engine or recommendation system that uses tiers to organize data.

The `TierConfig` class has several static fields that define default values for tier configurations. These include the default configuration directory, the default tier file, the default tier start and end dates, the default tier name, and the default read type. The class also has a logger that logs messages to the console.

The `TierConfig` class has several static methods that allow users to access and modify tier configurations. The `getConfigFile()` method returns the `ConfigFile` object that represents the tier configuration file. The `getConfigFileName()` method returns the name of the tier configuration file. The `getTierNames()` method returns a set of all the tier names specified in the config file. The `setForTests()` method sets the value of the given tier config property to the given value. The `getTierInfo()` method returns the config info for the specified tier and environment.

The `TierConfig` class also has several private methods that are used internally. The `init()` method initializes the `tierConfigFile` and `tierConfigSource` fields if they are null. The `clear()` method clears the `tierConfigFile` and `tierConfigSource` fields. The `getTierConfigSource()` method returns the `tierConfigSource` field. The `getRequestReadType()` method returns the `TierInfo.RequestReadType` enum value for the given string value.

Overall, the `TierConfig` class provides a way to access and modify tier configurations for a cluster. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes in the larger project to organize and retrieve data. Here is an example of how to use the `TierConfig` class to get the tier info for a specific tier:

```
TierInfo tierInfo = TierConfig.getTierInfo("tierName");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides APIs to access the tier configurations for a cluster, where each tier has a tier name, number of partitions, tier start time, and end time.

2. What is the significance of the DEFAULT_TIER_START_DATE and DEFAULT_TIER_END_DATE constants?
- DEFAULT_TIER_START_DATE is the default start date for a tier's data range, while DEFAULT_TIER_END_DATE is the default end date for a tier's data range. It is convenient for DEFAULT_TIER_END_DATE to be before ~2100 because then the output of FieldTermCounter.getHourValue(DEFAULT_TIER_END_END_DATE) can still fit into an integer.
 
3. What is the purpose of the getRequestReadType method?
- The getRequestReadType method returns the RequestReadType for a tier, which is either LIGHT or FULL. It takes in a readTypeEnumName and a defaultReadType, and returns the defaultReadType if readTypeEnumName is null, otherwise it returns the RequestReadType corresponding to the readTypeEnumName.
