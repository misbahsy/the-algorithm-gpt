The code above defines an interface called ServingRange, which is used to abstract a tier's serving range. This interface has four methods that return information about the serving range: getServingRangeSinceId(), getServingRangeMaxId(), getServingRangeSinceTimeSecondsFromEpoch(), and getServingRangeUntilTimeSecondsFromEpoch(). 

The first two methods return the lowest and highest tweet IDs in the serving range, respectively. The third and fourth methods return the earliest and latest times in seconds since epoch that the tweets in the serving range were created. 

This interface is likely used in the larger project to define the serving range for a tier of tweets. A tier is a subset of tweets that are served by a specific server or set of servers. By abstracting the serving range, the project can easily switch between different tiers without having to change the code that accesses the tweets. 

For example, suppose the project has three tiers of tweets: recent, popular, and all. The recent tier contains tweets that were created in the last hour, the popular tier contains tweets that have been retweeted at least 100 times, and the all tier contains all tweets. Each tier has a different serving range, which is defined by implementing the ServingRange interface. 

To access tweets from a specific tier, the project can simply call the appropriate method on the ServingRange object for that tier. For example, to get the lowest tweet ID in the recent tier, the project would call the getServingRangeSinceId() method on the ServingRange object for the recent tier. 

Overall, the ServingRange interface provides a flexible and extensible way to define serving ranges for different tiers of tweets in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this interface and how is it used in the project?
   - This interface is used to abstract a tier's serving range and provide methods to get the lowest and highest tweet IDs as well as earliest and latest times. Its purpose is to provide a common interface for different tiers to implement and use in the project.

2. What are the expected data types for the return values of the methods in this interface?
   - The return values for all four methods are expected to be of type `long`, representing tweet IDs and seconds since epoch.

3. Are there any specific requirements or constraints on the values returned by the methods in this interface?
   - The code does not specify any specific requirements or constraints on the values returned by the methods in this interface. It is up to the implementation of each tier to ensure that the values returned are valid and consistent with the tier's serving range.
