The `TruncationTokenStreamWriter` class is a part of the Earlybird project from Twitter and is responsible for truncating tweets that exceed a certain length. The purpose of this class is to rewrite the token stream of a tweet's text field to truncate the text if it exceeds a certain length. The maximum length of a tweet is determined by a decider, which is a component of the Earlybird project that makes decisions based on certain criteria. 

The `TruncationTokenStreamWriter` class implements the `SchemaDocumentFactory.TokenStreamRewriter` interface, which requires the implementation of a `rewrite` method. This method takes in a `Schema.FieldInfo` object and a `TwitterTokenStream` object and returns a new `TwitterTokenStream` object. If the `FieldInfo` object represents the text field of a tweet, the method truncates the text if it exceeds the maximum length determined by the decider. The maximum length is obtained by calling the `getTruncatePosition` method, which checks the decider to see if truncation is enabled and what the maximum length is. If truncation is not enabled, the method returns -1. If truncation is enabled, the method returns the maximum length, which is set as a `SearchLongGauge` object. 

If the maximum length is greater than or equal to a constant value of 140, the method creates a new `TokenProcessor` object that processes the `TwitterTokenStream` object and truncates the text if it exceeds the maximum length. The `TokenProcessor` object overrides the `incrementToken` method to check the length of the text and truncate it if necessary. If the text is truncated, a `SearchCounter` object is incremented to keep track of the number of tweets that have been truncated. 

Overall, the `TruncationTokenStreamWriter` class is an important component of the Earlybird project that ensures tweets are not too long and can be processed efficiently. It works by checking a decider to determine the maximum length of a tweet and truncating the text if necessary. This class can be used in conjunction with other components of the Earlybird project to process tweets and extract relevant information. 

Example usage:

```
Decider decider = new Decider();
EarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster();
TruncationTokenStreamWriter tokenStreamWriter = new TruncationTokenStreamWriter(cluster, decider);
Schema.FieldInfo fieldInfo = new Schema.FieldInfo("text", "tweet text");
TwitterTokenStream tokenStream = new TwitterTokenStream();
TwitterTokenStream truncatedStream = tokenStreamWriter.rewrite(fieldInfo, tokenStream);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class that implements a token stream rewriter for truncating long tweets based on a maximum character limit.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries and classes, including TokenProcessor and TwitterTokenStream from the Twitter common text token package, Decider from the Twitter decider package, and several classes from the Twitter search common schema and metrics packages.

3. How is the truncation position determined?
- The truncation position is determined by a Decider object that checks whether truncation is enabled for the current EarlybirdCluster and retrieves the maximum number of characters supported for tweets. If the maximum is less than a certain threshold, the truncation position is set to that threshold to avoid truncating short tweets.
