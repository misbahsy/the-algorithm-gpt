The `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` class is responsible for building a Lucene document from a `ThriftIndexingEvent`. This class is a simplified version of the `ThriftIndexingEventDocumentFactory` and is used for update events that exclude many fields that the tweet indexing events contain. 

The `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` class extends the `DocumentFactory` class and overrides two methods: `getStatusId` and `innerNewDocument`. The `getStatusId` method retrieves the status ID from the `ThriftIndexingEvent` object. The `innerNewDocument` method creates a new Lucene document from the `ThriftIndexingEvent` object. 

The `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` class has four instance variables: `schemaDocumentFactory`, `cluster`, `schema`, and `ID_MAPPING`. The `schemaDocumentFactory` is an instance of the `SchemaDocumentFactory` class, which is used to create a new Lucene document from a `ThriftDocument`. The `cluster` is an instance of the `EarlybirdCluster` class, which represents the cluster of servers that the `ThriftIndexingEvent` object is being processed on. The `schema` is an instance of the `Schema` class, which represents the schema of the data being indexed. The `ID_MAPPING` is an instance of the `FieldNameToIdMapping` class, which maps field names to field IDs. 

The `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes four arguments: `schema`, `cluster`, `decider`, and `criticalExceptionHandler`. The `schema` argument is the schema of the data being indexed. The `cluster` argument is the cluster of servers that the `ThriftIndexingEvent` object is being processed on. The `decider` argument is an instance of the `Decider` class, which is used to make decisions about how to process the `ThriftIndexingEvent` object. The `criticalExceptionHandler` argument is an instance of the `CriticalExceptionHandler` class, which is used to handle critical exceptions that occur during processing. The second constructor is used for testing purposes and takes four arguments: `schema`, `schemaDocumentFactory`, `cluster`, and `criticalExceptionHandler`. 

Overall, the `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` class is an important part of the indexing process for the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. It is used to create Lucene documents from `ThriftIndexingEvent` objects, which are then indexed by the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code builds a Lucene Document from a ThriftIndexingEvent, which is a simplified version of the tweet indexing events. It solves the problem of excluding many fields that the tweet indexing events contain.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several packages, including `com.google.common`, `org.apache.lucene`, `com.twitter.decider`, `com.twitter.search.common.schema`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.exception`.

3. What is the difference between `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` and `ThriftIndexingEventDocumentFactory`?
- `ThriftIndexingEventUpdateFactory` is a simplified version of `ThriftIndexingEventDocumentFactory` that can be used for update events, which exclude many fields that the tweet indexing events contain.
