The `TweetDocument` class is a record produced by `DocumentReader` and `TweetIndexUpdateReader` for consumption by the partition indexer. It contains four fields: `tweetID`, `timeSliceID`, `eventTimeMs`, and `document`. 

The `tweetID` field is a `long` that represents the unique identifier of a tweet. The `timeSliceID` field is also a `long` that represents the time slice to which the tweet belongs. The `eventTimeMs` field is a `long` that represents the time at which the tweet was created. Finally, the `document` field is an instance of the `Document` class from the Apache Lucene library, which represents the tweet as a Lucene document.

The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized format for representing tweets that can be consumed by the partition indexer. The partition indexer is responsible for indexing tweets based on various criteria, such as time, location, and content. By using a standardized format, the partition indexer can easily process tweets produced by different sources and apply the appropriate indexing criteria.

Here is an example of how the `TweetDocument` class might be used in the larger project:

```java
DocumentReader reader = new DocumentReader();
TweetDocument tweetDoc = reader.read(tweet);
long tweetID = tweetDoc.getTweetID();
long timeSliceID = tweetDoc.getTimeSliceID();
long eventTimeMs = tweetDoc.getEventTimeMs();
Document luceneDoc = tweetDoc.getDocument();

PartitionIndexer indexer = new PartitionIndexer();
indexer.index(luceneDoc, timeSliceID, eventTimeMs, tweetID);
```

In this example, a `DocumentReader` instance is used to read a tweet and produce a `TweetDocument` instance. The `tweetID`, `timeSliceID`, `eventTimeMs`, and `document` fields are then extracted from the `TweetDocument` instance and passed to a `PartitionIndexer` instance for indexing. The `PartitionIndexer` uses the `timeSliceID` and `eventTimeMs` fields to determine the appropriate partition for the tweet and indexes the `luceneDoc` using the `tweetID`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the larger project?
- This class represents a record produced by two other classes for consumption by the partition indexer. It likely contains information about a tweet and its metadata.
2. What is the significance of the "document" field and what type of data does it contain?
- The "document" field is of type org.apache.lucene.document.Document, which suggests that it contains Lucene documents that are used for indexing and searching.
3. Are there any potential issues with the immutability of this class, given that all fields are final and there are no setter methods?
- Depending on how this class is used in the larger project, the lack of setter methods could potentially make it difficult to update or modify TweetDocument objects after they are created. However, this may be intentional if immutability is desired for consistency and thread-safety.
