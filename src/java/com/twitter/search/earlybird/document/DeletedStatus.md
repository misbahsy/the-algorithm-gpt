The code defines a class called `DeletedStatus` which is used as a marker to indicate that a tweet in a specific time slice has been deleted. The class has two instance variables, `timeSliceID` and `statusID`, both of which are of type `long`. The constructor takes in two arguments, `timeSliceID` and `statusID`, and initializes the instance variables with these values.

This class is likely used in the larger project to keep track of deleted tweets in a specific time slice. It may be used in conjunction with other classes and methods to analyze Twitter data and provide insights to users. For example, the project may use this class to keep track of the number of deleted tweets in a specific time slice and use this information to adjust its analysis and predictions.

Here is an example of how this class may be used in a larger project:

```
DeletedStatus deletedTweet = new DeletedStatus(123456789, 987654321);
// This creates a new instance of DeletedStatus with timeSliceID = 123456789 and statusID = 987654321

// The instance can then be used in other parts of the project, such as:
if (someCondition) {
  // Do something with the deleted tweet
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the DeletedStatus class?
   - The DeletedStatus class is a marker indicating that a tweet in a specific timeslice has been deleted.

2. What are the parameters for the DeletedStatus constructor?
   - The DeletedStatus constructor takes in two parameters: a long representing the timeslice ID and a long representing the status ID.

3. Can the values of timeSliceID and statusID be modified after they are set in the constructor?
   - No, the timeSliceID and statusID variables are declared as final, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are set in the constructor.
