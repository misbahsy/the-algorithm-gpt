The EarlybirdCPUQualityFactor class is responsible for managing the quality factor for an Earlybird based on CPU usage. The quality factor is a value between 0 and 1 that determines the quality of the search results returned by Earlybird. A higher quality factor means better search results, while a lower quality factor means worse search results. The purpose of this class is to adjust the quality factor based on the CPU usage of the system running Earlybird.

The class implements the QualityFactor interface, which defines two methods: get() and startUpdates(). The get() method returns the current quality factor, while the startUpdates() method starts a thread that updates the quality factor based on CPU usage every minute.

The class uses the com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean class to get the CPU usage of the system. It also uses the com.twitter.decider.Decider class to determine if quality factoring is enabled and if the quality factor has been overridden by a decider.

The update() method is called by the startUpdates() method every minute to update the quality factor based on CPU usage. If the CPU usage is below a certain threshold, the quality factor is incremented by a maximum amount. If the CPU usage is above the threshold, the quality factor is decremented by a maximum amount. The amount of increment or decrement is determined by the difference between the CPU usage and the threshold.

The class also logs information about the quality factor and the CPU usage using the org.slf4j.Logger class. It reports the underlying CPU QF value and the QF actually used to degrade Earlybirds.

Overall, the EarlybirdCPUQualityFactor class is an important component of the Earlybird search engine. It ensures that the quality of search results is adjusted based on the CPU usage of the system running Earlybird. This helps to ensure that Earlybird is always providing the best possible search results while minimizing the impact on system resources.
## Questions:
