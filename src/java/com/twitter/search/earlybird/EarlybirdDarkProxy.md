The `EarlybirdDarkProxy` class is responsible for creating and managing a `DarkProxy` object, which is used to make requests to a dark service. A dark service is a service that is not yet publicly available, but is being tested by a select group of users. The purpose of the `DarkProxy` is to allow these users to test the service without exposing it to the public.

The `EarlybirdDarkProxy` constructor takes several parameters, including a `SearchDecider`, a `StatsReceiver`, an `EarlybirdServerSetManager`, an `EarlybirdWarmUpManager`, and a `clusterName`. The `SearchDecider` is used to determine whether a request should be sent to the dark service or to the public service. The `StatsReceiver` is used to collect statistics about the requests. The `EarlybirdServerSetManager` and `EarlybirdWarmUpManager` are used to manage the server set and warm-up servers for the dark service. The `clusterName` is used to identify the cluster of servers that the dark service is running on.

The `newDarkProxy` method creates a new `DarkProxy` object using the parameters passed to the constructor. It creates a `ResolverProxy` object, which is used to resolve the server set for the dark service. It then creates a `SelfServerSetResolver` object, which is used to resolve the server set for the warm-up servers. It creates a new `DarkProxy` object using these objects, along with a `BytesToThriftFilter` and the `StatsReceiver`. It also overrides the `getServicePathDeciderKey` method to return a different key for the warm-up server set. Finally, it initializes the `DarkProxy` object and returns it.

The `newClientBuilder` method creates a new `ClientBuilder` object, which is used to configure the client that will be used to make requests to the dark service. It sets various timeouts and retries, and also sets up tracing and mutual TLS. It then returns the `ClientBuilder` object.

Overall, the `EarlybirdDarkProxy` class is an important component of the larger project, as it allows select users to test a dark service without exposing it to the public. It uses a `DarkProxy` object to make requests to the dark service, and also collects statistics about the requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a Java class called EarlybirdDarkProxy that provides a DarkProxy object for making requests to a server cluster. It solves the problem of routing requests to a server cluster based on a search decider and a server set resolver.

2. What are the configurable parameters for the DarkProxy object? 
- The configurable parameters for the DarkProxy object include the total request timeout, individual request timeout, connect timeout, number of retries, and Finagle client ID. These parameters are set using values from the EarlybirdConfig class.

3. What is the purpose of the newClientBuilder method and what does it return? 
- The newClientBuilder method creates a new ClientBuilder object for building a Finagle client. It sets various configuration options for the client, such as timeouts and retries, and returns the ClientBuilder object. The ClientBuilder object is used to create a new MtlsThriftMuxClient object, which is then used to build the Finagle client.
