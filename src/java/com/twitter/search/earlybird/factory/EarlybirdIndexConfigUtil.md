The `EarlybirdIndexConfigUtil` class is responsible for creating the index configuration for the Earlybird search system. The Earlybird search system is a real-time search engine developed by Twitter. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to create the index configuration for different types of searches, such as archive search, protected search, and real-time search.

The `createEarlybirdIndexConfig` method takes three parameters: `decider`, `searchIndexingMetricSet`, and `criticalExceptionHandler`. It returns an instance of `EarlybirdIndexConfig`, which is an abstract class that defines the configuration for the Earlybird search system. The method first checks if the search is an archive search, a protected search, or a real-time search, and then creates the appropriate configuration object based on the type of search.

The `isArchiveSearch`, `isProtectedSearch`, and `isRealtimeCG` methods are used to determine the type of search. These methods read the configuration settings from the `EarlybirdConfig` class and return a boolean value indicating whether the search is an archive search, a protected search, or a real-time search.

Overall, the `EarlybirdIndexConfigUtil` class is an important part of the Earlybird search system, as it provides a way to create the index configuration for different types of searches. This class can be used by other classes in the Earlybird search system to create the index configuration for their specific needs. For example, if a new type of search is added to the system, a new method can be added to this class to create the index configuration for that type of search.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is responsible for creating the index configuration for Earlybird, a search engine developed by Twitter.

2. What are the different types of Earlybird index configurations that can be created?
- The different types of Earlybird index configurations that can be created are ArchiveOnDiskEarlybirdIndexConfig, RealtimeEarlybirdIndexConfig for EarlybirdCluster.PROTECTED, RealtimeEarlybirdIndexConfig for EarlybirdCluster.REALTIME_CG, and RealtimeEarlybirdIndexConfig for EarlybirdCluster.REALTIME.

3. What is the purpose of the isArchiveSearch(), isProtectedSearch(), and isRealtimeCG() methods?
- The isArchiveSearch() method checks if the partition manager is set to ArchiveSearchPartitionManager.CONFIG_NAME. The isProtectedSearch() method checks if the protected_index configuration is set to true. The isRealtimeCG() method checks if the realtime_cg_index configuration is set to true.
