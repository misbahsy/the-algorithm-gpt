The `EarlybirdWireModule` class is part of a larger project that deals with searching and indexing tweets from Twitter. This class is responsible for providing and managing various components required for the search and indexing process. It includes components for handling Kafka consumers, ZooKeeper clients, query cache management, segment management, and more.

For example, the `provideDecider()` method initializes and returns an instance of `Decider`, which is responsible for making decisions based on various conditions. The `provideZooKeeperClients()` method returns a `ZooKeeperClients` object that contains two ZooKeeper clients, one for service discovery and another for managing state.

The `provideQueryCacheManager()` method creates and returns a `QueryCacheManager` instance, which is responsible for managing the query cache. The `provideSegmentManager()` method returns a `SegmentManager` instance, which is responsible for managing segments in the search and indexing process.

The class also provides methods for creating and managing Kafka consumers, such as `provideUserUpdatesKafkaConsumer()` and `provideUserScrubGeoEventKafkaConsumer()`, which are responsible for reading user updates and geo scrubbing events, respectively.

In addition to these components, the class provides various utility methods and configurations, such as `provideClock()`, `provideSearchIndexingMetricSet()`, and `provideEarlybirdServerStatsReceiver()`.

Overall, the `EarlybirdWireModule` class plays a crucial role in the larger project by providing and managing various components required for searching and indexing tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `EarlybirdWireModule` class?
   **Answer**: The `EarlybirdWireModule` class is responsible for providing and configuring various components and dependencies for the Earlybird project, such as index configuration, segment manager, query cache manager, and more.

2. **Question**: How does the `provideEarlybirdStartup` method determine which type of `PartitionManager` to use?
   **Answer**: The `provideEarlybirdStartup` method checks the value of the `EarlybirdCluster` variable. If it is equal to `EarlybirdCluster.FULL_ARCHIVE`, it uses the `ArchiveSearchPartitionManager`. Otherwise, it uses the `KafkaStartup` manager.

3. **Question**: How does the `provideScoringModelsManager` method decide whether to load scoring models or not?
   **Answer**: The `provideScoringModelsManager` method checks the value of the `scoring_models_enabled` configuration property. If it is set to `false`, it returns a `NO_OP_MANAGER` instance, indicating that no scoring models should be loaded. If it is set to `true`, it proceeds to create and return a `ScoringModelsManager` instance with the specified configuration.
