The `PartitionConfigUtil` class is a utility class that provides methods for initializing and creating instances of the `PartitionConfig` class. The `PartitionConfig` class is used to configure the partitioning of data for the Earlybird search system at Twitter.

The `initPartitionConfigForAurora` method initializes a `PartitionConfig` instance for Earlybird running on Aurora, which is Twitter's internal compute platform. The method takes an integer parameter `numOfInstances` which represents the number of instances of Earlybird running on Aurora. The method first retrieves the `tier`, `partitionId`, and `replicaId` from the `EarlybirdProperty` class, which is a configuration class that holds various properties for Earlybird. If the `tier` is the default tier, which is either realtime or protected earlybird, the method creates a new `PartitionConfig` instance with the given `partitionId`, `numOfInstances`, and `numPartitions` properties from `EarlybirdProperty`. If the `tier` is not the default tier, which is archive earlybird, the method retrieves the `TierInfo` for the given `tier` from the `TierConfig` class, which is another configuration class that holds various properties for Earlybird tiers. The method then creates a new `PartitionConfig` instance with the `TierInfo` properties and the given `partitionId`, `replicaId`, `numOfInstances`, and `numPartitions` properties from `EarlybirdProperty`.

The `initPartitionConfig` method is a wrapper method that calls the `initPartitionConfigForAurora` method with the `numOfInstances` property from `EarlybirdProperty`.

Overall, the `PartitionConfigUtil` class provides a convenient way to initialize and create instances of the `PartitionConfig` class for Earlybird search system at Twitter. This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and components in the Earlybird system to configure and partition data for efficient search and retrieval. 

Example usage:

```
PartitionConfig partitionConfig = PartitionConfigUtil.initPartitionConfig();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to initialize and create a PartitionConfig instance for earlybirds running on Aurora.

2. What is the significance of the "tier" variable?
- The "tier" variable is used to determine whether the earlybird is a realtime/protected earlybird or an archive earlybird, which affects the creation of the PartitionConfig instance.

3. What is the difference between the two methods, initPartitionConfigForAurora and initPartitionConfig?
- The initPartitionConfigForAurora method takes in the number of instances and creates a PartitionConfig instance based on the Aurora flags, while the initPartitionConfig method calls the former method with the number of instances obtained from EarlybirdProperty.NUM_INSTANCES.
