The `SegmentDataReaderSet` interface provides methods to create and manage the various `RecordReaders` used to index Earlybird segments. Earlybird is a Twitter project that provides a search engine for tweets. 

The interface has methods to attach document readers and update readers to a segment, mark a segment as complete, stop reading updates for a segment, stop all readers and close all resources, and check if all readers are caught up with the data sources they are reading from. 

The `newDocumentReader` method creates a new `DocumentReader` for the given segment that is not managed by this set. The `getDocumentReader` method returns the document reader for the current segment. The `getUpdateEventsReader` method returns a combined update events reader for all segments. The `getUpdateEventsReaderForSegment` method returns the update events reader for the given segment. The `getUpdateEventsStreamOffsetForSegment` method returns the offset in the update events stream for the given segment that this Earlybird should start indexing from.

This interface is used to manage the `RecordReaders` that read data from segments of tweets. The `RecordReaders` are used to index the tweets and provide search functionality. The methods in this interface are called by other classes in the Earlybird project to manage the `RecordReaders` for each segment. 

Example usage of this interface would be to call the `attachDocumentReaders` method to attach document readers to a segment, and then call the `getDocumentReader` method to get the document reader for that segment. This document reader can then be used to read the tweets in that segment and index them for search.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines an interface for creating and managing RecordReaders used to index Earlybird segments in the Twitter search project.

2. What are RecordReaders and how are they used in this code?
- RecordReaders are used to read records from data sources and are created and managed by this interface to index Earlybird segments.

3. What is the difference between document and non-document RecordReaders in this code?
- Document RecordReaders are used to read document records from a segment, while non-document RecordReaders (such as deletes and features) are used to read other types of records from a segment.
