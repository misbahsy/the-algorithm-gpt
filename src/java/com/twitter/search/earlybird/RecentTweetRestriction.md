The `RecentTweetRestriction` class is a utility class that provides two static methods to calculate the time until which tweets should be indexed. This is required by some clients that rely on Earlybird monotonically indexing tweets by ID and that tweets are completely indexed when they see them. 

The class has two constants, `RECENT_TWEETS_THRESHOLD` and `QUERY_CACHE_UNTIL_TIME`, which are used as keys to retrieve the recent tweet seconds from the `Decider` object. The `Decider` object is passed as a parameter to the two public methods, `recentTweetsUntilTime` and `queryCacheUntilTime`. 

Both methods take an integer parameter `lastTime`, which represents the time at which the most recent tweet was indexed, in seconds since the Unix epoch. The methods call the private method `untilTimeSeconds` to calculate the time until which tweets should be indexed. 

The `untilTimeSeconds` method retrieves the recent tweet seconds from the `Decider` object using the `getRecentTweetSeconds` method. If the recent tweet seconds are zero, the method returns zero. Otherwise, it calculates the time until which tweets should be indexed by subtracting the recent tweet seconds from the `lastTime` parameter. 

The `getRecentTweetSeconds` method retrieves the recent tweet seconds from the `Decider` object using the `getAvailability` method. If the value is defined, it returns the integer value of the option. Otherwise, it returns the default recent tweet seconds value, which is 15 seconds. 

Overall, this class provides a simple way to calculate the time until which tweets should be indexed, which is required by some clients that rely on Earlybird monotonically indexing tweets by ID and that tweets are completely indexed when they see them. 

Example usage:

```
Decider decider = new Decider();
int lastTime = 1630483200; // September 1, 2021 12:00:00 AM UTC
int recentTweetsUntilTime = RecentTweetRestriction.recentTweetsUntilTime(decider, lastTime);
int queryCacheUntilTime = RecentTweetRestriction.queryCacheUntilTime(decider, lastTime);
System.out.println("Recent tweets until time: " + recentTweetsUntilTime);
System.out.println("Query cache until time: " + queryCacheUntilTime);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides methods for returning the point in time before which all tweets will be completely indexed, required by some clients relying on Earlybird monotonically indexing tweets by ID.

2. What is the significance of the DEFAULT_RECENT_TWEET_SECONDS constant?
- The DEFAULT_RECENT_TWEET_SECONDS constant is the default value for the recentTweetSeconds variable, which is used to calculate the point in time before which all tweets will be completely indexed.

3. What is the purpose of the VisibleForTesting annotation?
- The VisibleForTesting annotation is used to indicate that the DEFAULT_RECENT_TWEET_SECONDS constant is public for testing purposes, but not intended for general use.
