The `RealtimeTimeMapper` class is a component of the Earlybird search engine project from Twitter. Its purpose is to map 32-bit document IDs to seconds-since-epoch timestamps. This is useful for indexing and searching tweets in real-time. 

The class extends the `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper` class and overrides its `getTime` and `setTime` methods. It also has a `timeMap` field, which is an `Int2IntOpenHashMap` that maps document IDs to timestamps. The `capacity` field specifies the maximum number of mappings that can be stored in the `timeMap`. 

The `addMapping` method is used to add a new mapping to the `timeMap`. The `optimize` method is used to optimize the `RealtimeTimeMapper` for searching. It takes two `DocIDToTweetIDMapper` objects as input and returns an `OptimizedTimeMapper` object. 

The `verySlowEqualsForTests` method is used to compare two instances of `RealtimeTimeMapper` for equality. It checks every tweet ID/timestamp in the map, so it is slow. 

The `FlushHandler` class is used to serialize and deserialize `RealtimeTimeMapper` objects. It writes the `capacity`, `reverseMapLastIndex`, and `timeMap` fields to a `DataSerializer`. It also writes the `reverseMapTimes` and `reverseMapIds` fields to the serializer using their respective `FlushHandler` objects. 

Overall, the `RealtimeTimeMapper` class is a key component of the Earlybird search engine project from Twitter. It provides a way to map document IDs to timestamps, which is essential for real-time indexing and searching of tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a RealtimeTimeMapper class that maps 32-bit document IDs to seconds-since-epoch timestamps. It is part of the Earlybird search indexing system for Twitter.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries, including Google Guava and fastutil.

3. What is the purpose of the `optimize` method and how is it used?
- The `optimize` method takes in two DocIDToTweetIDMapper objects and returns an optimized TimeMapper object. It is used to optimize the indexing system for better performance.
