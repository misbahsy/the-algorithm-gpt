The `TweetIDToInternalIDMap` class is a data structure that maps tweet IDs to internal document IDs. It is used in the larger project to efficiently retrieve the internal document ID given a tweet ID. 

The class uses an array of integers called `hash` to store the mappings. The `hashCode` method is used to generate an index into the `hash` array for a given tweet ID. If the index is already occupied, the method uses a linear probing technique to find the next available index. The `add` method is used to add a new mapping to the data structure, while the `get` method is used to retrieve the internal document ID given a tweet ID. 

The `TweetIDToInternalIDMap` class implements the `Flushable` interface, which means that it can be serialized and deserialized. The `FlushHandler` class is used to handle the serialization and deserialization of the `TweetIDToInternalIDMap` object. 

Overall, the `TweetIDToInternalIDMap` class is an important component of the larger project as it provides a fast and efficient way to map tweet IDs to internal document IDs. 

Example usage:

```
TweetIDToInternalIDMap map = new TweetIDToInternalIDMap(1000);
long tweetID = 1234567890L;
int internalID = 42;
long[] inverseMap = new long[1000];

map.add(tweetID, internalID, inverseMap);
int retrievedID = map.get(tweetID, inverseMap);
assert retrievedID == internalID;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a class called TweetIDToInternalIDMap that implements the Flushable interface. It is used to associate tweet IDs with internal document IDs and retrieve the corresponding document ID for a given tweet ID. It is part of the Earlybird indexing system for Twitter search.

2. What is the hash function used in this code and how does it work?
- The hash function used in this code is slightly different from the one used to partition tweets to Earlybirds. It takes the timestamp from the tweet ID, XORs it with a right-shifted version of itself, multiplies the result by a prime number, and adds the reserved bits of the tweet ID. The resulting code is used as the hash key.

3. What is the purpose of the FlushHandler class and how is it used?
- The FlushHandler class is a nested class that extends the Flushable.Handler abstract class. It is used to serialize and deserialize instances of the TweetIDToInternalIDMap class for flushing to disk. It writes the hash array size, mask, and number of mappings as properties, and writes the hash array itself as an integer array. It also provides a constructor that takes a TweetIDToInternalIDMap object to flush.
