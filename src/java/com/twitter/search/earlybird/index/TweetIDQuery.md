The `TweetIDQuery` class is a Lucene query that matches documents based on a set of tweet IDs. It is used in the Earlybird search engine project by Twitter to search for tweets in their index. 

The class extends the `Query` class from Lucene and overrides several of its methods. The constructor takes a variable number of tweet IDs and adds them to a `Set`. The `createWeight` method creates a `Weight` object that is used to score documents in the index. It does this by iterating over the tweet IDs and looking up their corresponding document IDs in the index. If a tweet ID is found, its document ID is added to a set. The set is then sorted and returned as an `IntArrayDocIdSetIterator`, which is a specialized `DocIdSetIterator` that iterates over an array of document IDs. If no tweet IDs are found, an empty `DocIdSetIterator` is returned.

The `hashCode` and `equals` methods are overridden to ensure that two `TweetIDQuery` objects are equal if they contain the same set of tweet IDs. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the query that includes the tweet IDs.

This class is used in the Earlybird search engine project to search for tweets based on their IDs. For example, to search for tweets with IDs 123 and 456, you would create a `TweetIDQuery` object like this:

```
Query query = new TweetIDQuery(123, 456);
```

This query could then be passed to a Lucene `IndexSearcher` object to search for tweets in the index.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code defines a Lucene query that matches documents based on a set of tweet IDs. A smart developer might want to know where this query is used in the project and how it fits into the overall search functionality.

2. What is the performance impact of using this query on a large index?
   - This code retrieves a set of document IDs that match the tweet IDs, sorts them, and returns an iterator over the resulting array. A smart developer might want to know how this scales with the size of the index and whether there are any optimizations that could be made.

3. What is the purpose of the `DefaultFilterWeight` class and how does it work?
   - This code creates a custom Lucene `Weight` implementation that returns an iterator over the matching document IDs. A smart developer might want to know why the `DefaultFilterWeight` class is used and how it interacts with the `getDocIdSetIterator` method.
