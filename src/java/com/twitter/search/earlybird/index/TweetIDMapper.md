The TweetIDMapper class is an abstract class that provides a mapping between tweet IDs and document IDs. It implements the DocIDToTweetIDMapper interface and the Flushable interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to find the corresponding doc ID to start or end a search given a tweet ID. It also provides methods to add a mapping between a tweet ID and a doc ID, and to get the next or previous doc ID.

The class has several instance variables that store the minimum and maximum tweet IDs and doc IDs, as well as the number of documents. The class provides methods to set and get these variables. The addMapping method updates these variables when a new mapping is added.

The findDocIdBound method takes a tweet ID, a boolean flag to indicate whether to find the maximum or minimum doc ID, and the smallest and largest doc IDs to search. It returns the doc ID that corresponds to the tweet ID, or the next lowest doc ID if the tweet ID is not in the index. If the OutOfOrderRealtimeTweetIDMapper is used, the method returns either the largest or smallest possible doc ID for that millisecond.

The getNextDocID and getPreviousDocID methods return the next or previous doc ID given a current doc ID. These methods are implemented by calling getNextDocIDInternal and getPreviousDocIDInternal, respectively, which are abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

The addMappingInternal and findDocIDBoundInternal methods are also abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. The addMappingInternal method adds a mapping between a tweet ID and a doc ID, and the findDocIDBoundInternal method finds the corresponding doc ID given a tweet ID.

Overall, the TweetIDMapper class provides a way to map tweet IDs to doc IDs and vice versa, which is useful for searching and indexing tweets. It is an abstract class that must be subclassed to provide specific implementations for different use cases.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines an abstract class called `TweetIDMapper` that implements the `DocIDToTweetIDMapper` and `Flushable` interfaces. It provides methods for mapping tweet IDs to document IDs and vice versa. It is part of the `com.twitter.search.earlybird.index` package, which is likely related to indexing and searching tweets on Twitter.

2. What is the difference between `findDocIdBound` and `findDocIDBoundInternal` methods?
- `findDocIdBound` is a public method that takes in a tweet ID and returns the corresponding document ID to start or end a search. It calls the `findDocIDBoundInternal` method, which is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses of `TweetIDMapper`. The purpose of `findDocIDBoundInternal` is to actually perform the mapping from tweet ID to document ID, and the implementation may differ depending on the type of `TweetIDMapper`.

3. What is the purpose of the `minTweetID`, `maxTweetID`, `minDocID`, `maxDocID`, and `numDocs` instance variables?
- `minTweetID` and `maxTweetID` represent the minimum and maximum tweet IDs that have been mapped to document IDs so far. `minDocID` and `maxDocID` represent the minimum and maximum document IDs that have been assigned to tweet IDs so far. `numDocs` represents the total number of documents that have been indexed. These variables are used to keep track of the mapping between tweet IDs and document IDs, and to update the mapping as new tweets are added to the index.
