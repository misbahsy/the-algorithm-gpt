The `TimeMappingWriter` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used for indexing real-time data. It implements the `EarlybirdRealtimeIndexSegmentWriter.InvertedDocConsumer` interface, which is responsible for consuming inverted documents and mapping them to a specific time. The purpose of this class is to map the time of a document to a specific segment in the index.

The `TimeMappingWriter` class has two instance variables: `termAtt` and `mapper`. The `termAtt` variable is of type `IntTermAttribute` and is used to store the term of the document. The `mapper` variable is of type `RealtimeTimeMapper` and is used to map the time of the document to a specific segment in the index.

The `TimeMappingWriter` class has three methods: `start()`, `add()`, and `finish()`. The `start()` method is called when a new document is started. It initializes the `termAtt` variable with the `IntTermAttribute` class. The `add()` method is called when a new term is added to the document. It gets the time of the document from the `termAtt` variable and adds the mapping to the `mapper` variable. The `finish()` method is called when the document is finished.

This class is used in the larger project to index real-time data. It is used to map the time of a document to a specific segment in the index. This allows for faster retrieval of documents based on their time. For example, if a user wants to retrieve all documents from a specific time period, the index can quickly retrieve all documents from that time period by using the mapping created by the `TimeMappingWriter` class.

Example usage:

```
RealtimeTimeMapper mapper = new RealtimeTimeMapper();
TimeMappingWriter writer = new TimeMappingWriter(mapper);
writer.start(attributeSource, false);
writer.add(docId, position);
writer.finish();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a class called TimeMappingWriter that implements an interface called EarlybirdRealtimeIndexSegmentWriter.InvertedDocConsumer. It is used to map document IDs to timestamps in a real-time search index.

2. What is the RealtimeTimeMapper class and how is it used in this code?
- The RealtimeTimeMapper class is passed as a parameter to the constructor of the TimeMappingWriter class. It is used to add mappings between document IDs and timestamps.

3. What is the IntTermAttribute class and how is it used in this code?
- The IntTermAttribute class is used to represent integer term values in a Lucene index. In this code, it is used to store the timestamp value for each document being indexed.
