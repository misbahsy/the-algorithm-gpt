The `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper` class is a Java abstract class that implements the `TimeMapper` interface. It provides a reverse mapping of timestamps to the first document ID seen with that timestamp. The class is part of the Earlybird project, which is a search engine developed by Twitter.

The `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper` class has two instance variables: `reverseMapTimes` and `reverseMapIds`. Both are instances of the `IntBlockPool` class, which is a memory-efficient data structure for storing arrays of integers. `reverseMapTimes` stores the timestamps in sorted order, and `reverseMapIds` stores the corresponding document IDs. The `reverseMapLastIndex` variable keeps track of the last index in the `reverseMapTimes` and `reverseMapIds` arrays that has been used.

The class provides three methods that implement the `TimeMapper` interface: `getLastTime()`, `getFirstTime()`, and `findFirstDocId()`. `getLastTime()` returns the timestamp of the last document that was added to the reverse mapping. `getFirstTime()` returns the timestamp of the first document that was added to the reverse mapping. `findFirstDocId()` takes a timestamp and a document ID as input and returns the ID of the first document that was added to the reverse mapping with a timestamp greater than or equal to the input timestamp.

The `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper` class also provides two protected methods: `setTime()` and `doAddMapping()`. `setTime()` is an abstract method that must be implemented by any concrete subclass of `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper`. It takes a document ID and a timestamp as input and sets the timestamp for that document in the reverse mapping. `doAddMapping()` is a helper method that is called by concrete subclasses to add a new document to the reverse mapping. It takes a document ID and a timestamp as input and adds them to the reverse mapping if the timestamp is greater than any timestamp seen before.

The `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper` class is used by other classes in the Earlybird project to implement time-based queries. For example, the `SinceUntilFilter` class uses `findFirstDocId()` to find the first document that matches a time-based query. The `AbstractInMemoryTimeMapper` class provides an efficient way to perform this type of query by maintaining a reverse mapping of timestamps to document IDs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is part of the Earlybird search indexing system for Twitter and provides a time mapping function for tweets. It is likely used in conjunction with other components to enable efficient search and retrieval of tweets based on time.

2. What is the significance of the `reverseMapTimes` and `reverseMapIds` arrays?
- These arrays provide a reverse mapping from timestamps to the first document ID seen with that timestamp. They are used by the `findFirstDocId` method to efficiently retrieve the first document ID that matches a given timestamp.

3. What is the purpose of the `doAddMapping` method and how is it used?
- The `doAddMapping` method is used to add a new timestamp and document ID mapping to the `reverseMapTimes` and `reverseMapIds` arrays. It is called by other methods in the class when a new tweet is indexed and its timestamp is greater than any previously seen. This method ensures that the reverse mapping arrays are updated to reflect the new tweet's timestamp and ID.
