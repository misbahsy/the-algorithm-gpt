The `ArchiveHDFSUtils` class provides utility methods for managing segments of data stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for the Twitter search project. The class contains several static methods that can be used to check if a segment already has its indices built on HDFS, delete the segment index directories on HDFS, and get the end date of the index built on HDFS. 

The `hasSegmentIndicesOnHDFS` method checks if a given segment already has its indices built on HDFS. It takes two arguments: `sync`, which is an instance of `SegmentSyncConfig` class, and `segment`, which is an instance of `SegmentInfo` class. The method returns `true` if the indices exist on HDFS; otherwise, it returns `false`. 

The `deleteHdfsSegmentDir` method deletes the segment index directories on HDFS. It takes four arguments: `sync`, which is an instance of `SegmentSyncConfig` class, `segment`, which is an instance of `SegmentInfo` class, `deleteCurrentDir`, which is a boolean value indicating whether to delete the index directory with the end date matching `segment`, and `deleteOlderDirs`, which is a boolean value indicating whether to delete the index directories with the end date earlier than the segment end date. 

The `getSegmentEndDateOnHdfs` method checks if there is any indices built on HDFS for a given segment. If yes, it returns the end date of the index built on HDFS; otherwise, it returns `null`. It takes two arguments: `sync`, which is an instance of `SegmentSyncConfig` class, and `segment`, which is an instance of `SegmentInfo` class.

The `extractEndDate` method extracts the end date from the segment directory pattern. It takes a string argument `segmentDirPattern` and returns a string representing the end date. 

The `dateToPath` method converts the given date to a path, using the given separator. It takes two arguments: `date`, which is an instance of `Date` class, and `separator`, which is a string representing the separator to be used. For example, if the date is January 5, 2019, and the separator is "/", this method will return "2019/01/05".

Overall, the `ArchiveHDFSUtils` class provides useful utility methods for managing segments of data stored in HDFS for the Twitter search project. These methods can be used to check if a segment already has its indices built on HDFS, delete the segment index directories on HDFS, and get the end date of the index built on HDFS.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility methods for working with HDFS segments in the context of the Earlybird project at Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including Apache Commons IO and SLF4J.

3. What is the significance of the regular expression pattern defined in this code?
- The regular expression pattern is used to extract information from HDFS segment names, including start time, partition number, and end date.
