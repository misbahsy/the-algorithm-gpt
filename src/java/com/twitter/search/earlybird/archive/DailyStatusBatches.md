The `DailyStatusBatches` class in this code is responsible for managing and accessing preprocessed tweet statuses (tweets) to be indexed by the archive search earlybirds. These tweets can come from a scrub gen or from the output of daily jobs.

The class provides methods to load, refresh, and store daily status batches from/to HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). It also checks if the directory has new data and loads new daily batches if available. The class uses a global lock to coordinate among earlybirds and segment builders so that only one instance would hit the HDFS name node to query the daily status directories.

Some key methods in this class include:

- `refresh()`: Checks the directory for new data and loads new daily batches if available.
- `hasValidBatchForDay(Date day)`: Determines if the directory has a valid batch for the given day.
- `loadDay(FileSystem hdfs, Date day)`: Loads the daily status batch for the given day from HDFS.
- `storeStatusBatchesToHdfs(FileSystem fs, Date day)`: Flushes the daily status batches to local disk and then uploads them to HDFS.

Here's an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```java
ZooKeeperTryLockFactory zooKeeperTryLockFactory = ...;
Date scrubGenDay = ...;
DailyStatusBatches dailyStatusBatches = new DailyStatusBatches(zooKeeperTryLockFactory, scrubGenDay);

// Refresh the daily status batches
dailyStatusBatches.refresh();

// Check if the directory has a valid batch for a specific day
Date dayToCheck = ...;
boolean hasValidBatch = dailyStatusBatches.hasValidBatchForDay(dayToCheck);
```

This class is essential for managing the tweet statuses data used by the archive search earlybirds, ensuring that the data is up-to-date and accessible for indexing.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DailyStatusBatches` class and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `DailyStatusBatches` class provides access to preprocessed statuses (tweets) to be indexed by archive search earlybirds. These tweets can be coming from a scrub gen or from the output of the daily jobs. The class contains methods for loading, refreshing, and storing daily status batches from/to HDFS, as well as checking the validity of batches and directories.

2. **Question**: How does the `refresh()` method work in this class?
   **Answer**: The `refresh()` method checks the directory for new data and initializes or updates the daily status batches accordingly. If the directory is not initialized, it tries to load or compute daily status batches from HDFS. If the directory is already initialized, it loads new daily batches from HDFS.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `isScrubGenDataFullyBuilt()` method?
   **Answer**: The `isScrubGenDataFullyBuilt()` method checks if the data for the specified scrub gen was fully built by comparing the number of days for which data was built against the expected number of days extracted from the specified scrub gen date. It returns true if the expected number of days matches the actual number of days with valid scrub gen data.
