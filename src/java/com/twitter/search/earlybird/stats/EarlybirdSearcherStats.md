The `EarlybirdSearcherStats` class manages counter and timer stats for the `EarlybirdSearcher`. The purpose of this class is to record and manage various statistics related to the search queries performed by the `EarlybirdSearcher`. These statistics include counters for different types of queries, filters, and signals used, as well as timers for measuring the latency of different types of scoring functions used in the search queries.

The class contains several public and private fields that are used to store the different types of counters and timers. These fields are initialized in the constructor of the class, which takes a `SearchStatsReceiver` object as a parameter. The `SearchStatsReceiver` object is used to create and manage the different counters and timers.

The class contains several public methods that are used to record and manage the different statistics. The `recordRelevanceStats` method is used to record the latency for a request for the applicable stats. This method takes a stopped timer that timed the request and the request that was timed as parameters. The method checks if the request is a ranking search with a set type and records the latency for the applicable stats.

The `createTimer` method is used to create a search timer with options specified by `SearchMetricTimerOptions`. This method returns a new `SearchTimer` object.

The class also contains several private methods that are used to get the different timer stats by type, client, and TensorFlow model. These methods are used to create and manage the different timers for measuring the latency of different types of scoring functions used in the search queries.

Overall, the `EarlybirdSearcherStats` class is an important component of the `EarlybirdSearcher` project as it provides valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness of the search queries performed by the `EarlybirdSearcher`. The statistics recorded by this class can be used to optimize and improve the search algorithms used by the `EarlybirdSearcher`.
