The `SegmentSyncStats` class is responsible for tracking statistics related to segment synchronization in the Twitter search system. It contains several counters that track the latency and CPU usage of segment synchronization actions, as well as the number of successful and failed actions.

The class has a private constructor that takes six `SearchCounter` objects as arguments. These counters are used to track the various statistics related to segment synchronization. The class also has a public constructor that takes a `String` argument representing the name of the segment synchronization action. This constructor creates new `SearchCounter` objects for each of the counters using the provided action name.

The `actionComplete` method is used to record a completed segment synchronization action. It takes a `Timer` object as an argument, which is used to record the elapsed time and CPU usage of the action. The method increments the `segmentSyncCount` counter and adds the elapsed time and CPU usage to the appropriate counters.

The `recordError` method is used to record a failed segment synchronization action. It simply increments the `segmentErrorCount` counter.

Overall, the `SegmentSyncStats` class provides a way to track the performance of segment synchronization actions in the Twitter search system. By using this class, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the system accordingly. Here is an example of how the class might be used:

```
SegmentSyncStats stats = new SegmentSyncStats("my_action");
Timer timer = new Timer();
// perform segment synchronization action
timer.stop();
stats.actionComplete(timer);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `SegmentSyncStats` that provides methods for recording and exporting statistics related to segment synchronization actions.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on two classes from the `com.twitter.search.common.metrics` package: `SearchCounter` and `Timer`.

3. What kind of statistics are being recorded and exported by this code?
- This code records and exports statistics related to segment synchronization actions, including latency, CPU usage, and error counts.
