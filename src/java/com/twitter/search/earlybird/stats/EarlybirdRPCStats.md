The `EarlybirdRPCStats` class is a Java class that extends the `SearchRequestStats` class and provides additional statistics specific to the Earlybird search algorithm used by Twitter. The class is used to record and track metrics related to search requests made by Earlybird. 

The class has three instance variables: `requestStats`, `earlyTerminatedRequests`, and `responseClientErrors`. The `requestStats` variable is an instance of the `SearchRequestStats` class and is used to track the request rate and average latency of search requests. The `earlyTerminatedRequests` variable is an instance of the `SearchCounter` class and is used to track the number of queries that were terminated early. The `responseClientErrors` variable is an instance of the `SearchRateCounter` class and is used to track the rate of client errors in the search responses.

The class has a constructor that takes a `name` parameter and initializes the instance variables. The `name` parameter is used to name the metrics that are tracked by the instance variables. The `getRequestRate()` method returns the request rate of the search requests, and the `getAverageLatency()` method returns the average latency of the search requests.

The `requestComplete()` method is used to record a completed search request. It takes several parameters, including the latency of the request, the number of results returned, whether the request was successful or not, whether the request was terminated early or not, and whether the request failure was caused by client errors. The method updates the `requestStats` instance variable with the request information and increments the `earlyTerminatedRequests` and `responseClientErrors` instance variables if the request was terminated early or if there was a client error, respectively.

Overall, the `EarlybirdRPCStats` class provides additional statistics specific to the Earlybird search algorithm used by Twitter. It is used to track the request rate, average latency, and other metrics related to search requests made by Earlybird. The class can be used in the larger project to monitor the performance of the Earlybird search algorithm and identify areas for improvement. 

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdRPCStats stats = new EarlybirdRPCStats("earlybird_stats");
stats.requestComplete(1000, 10, true, false, false);
long requestRate = stats.getRequestRate();
long averageLatency = stats.getAverageLatency();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called EarlybirdRPCStats that extends SearchRequestStats and adds additional stats specific to the Earlybird project.

2. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
- This code tracks the request rate and average latency of completed requests, as well as the number of early terminated requests and client errors.

3. How are client errors treated in the metrics?
- Client errors are treated as successes for top-line metrics to prevent bad client requests from dropping the success rate and generating alerts. However, client errors are tracked separately using the responseClientErrors counter.
