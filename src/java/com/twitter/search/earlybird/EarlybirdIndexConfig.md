The `EarlybirdIndexConfig` class is a collection of required indexing entities that differ in the various Earlybird clusters. It is an abstract class that provides a set of methods that can be implemented by its subclasses to create a new Lucene directory, a new Lucene IndexWriterConfig, and a new segment data object to add documents to. It also provides methods to load a flushed index for the given segment, create a new segment optimizer for the given segment data, and check whether the index is stored on disk or not. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a set of methods that can be used to configure the indexing process for different Earlybird clusters. It provides a way to create a new index config using an applicable schema built for the provided cluster. It also creates the appropriate document factory for this Earlybird and returns the EarlybirdCluster enum identifying the cluster this config is for. 

The `EarlybirdIndexConfig` class has several methods that can be used to create a document factory for ThriftIndexingEvents that are updates to the index. It also returns the default filter for UserUpdatesTable, which is used to keep users that belong to the current partition. 

Overall, the `EarlybirdIndexConfig` class is an important part of the Earlybird project as it provides a set of methods that can be used to configure the indexing process for different Earlybird clusters. It is a flexible and extensible class that can be used to create new Lucene directories, IndexWriterConfigs, and segment data objects to add documents to.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdIndexConfig class?
- The EarlybirdIndexConfig class is a collection of required indexing entities that differ in the various Earlybird clusters.

2. What are some of the methods that need to be implemented by subclasses of EarlybirdIndexConfig?
- Subclasses of EarlybirdIndexConfig need to implement methods for creating a new Lucene Directory, creating a new Lucene IndexWriterConfig, creating a new SegmentData object, loading a flushed index for a given segment, optimizing a segment data, determining whether the index is stored on disk, and supporting out-of-order indexing.

3. What is the purpose of the createDocumentFactory and createUpdateFactory methods?
- The createDocumentFactory method creates the appropriate document factory for this Earlybird, while the createUpdateFactory method creates a document factory for ThriftIndexingEvents that are updates to the index.
