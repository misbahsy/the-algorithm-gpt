The code above defines a custom exception class called `MissingKafkaTopicException`. This exception is thrown when a Kafka topic is missing in the Earlybird search system. 

The class extends the built-in `Exception` class and provides two constructors. The first constructor takes a `String` parameter `message` which is the error message to be displayed when the exception is thrown. The second constructor takes two parameters: a `String` message and a `Throwable` cause. The `Throwable` parameter is used to provide a more detailed explanation of the error that caused the exception to be thrown.

This custom exception class is likely used in the Earlybird search system to handle errors related to missing Kafka topics. When a Kafka topic is missing, this exception is thrown and the error message is displayed to the user. The user can then take appropriate action to resolve the issue, such as creating the missing Kafka topic.

Here is an example of how this custom exception class might be used in the Earlybird search system:

```
try {
  // code to search for tweets using Kafka topic
} catch (MissingKafkaTopicException e) {
  System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
  // code to handle missing Kafka topic error
}
```

In this example, the code attempts to search for tweets using a Kafka topic. If the Kafka topic is missing, the `MissingKafkaTopicException` is thrown and the error message is displayed to the user. The user can then handle the error appropriately.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the overall project?
   - This code defines a custom exception class called `MissingKafkaTopicException` that can be thrown when a Kafka topic is missing. A smart developer might want to know where and how this exception is handled in the project.

2. What other exception classes are defined in the project and how do they differ from this one?
   - A smart developer might want to compare this `MissingKafkaTopicException` class with other exception classes defined in the project to understand their similarities and differences. They might also want to know how these exceptions are handled and propagated throughout the project.

3. Are there any potential performance or security issues with this code?
   - While this code appears to be simple and straightforward, a smart developer might want to review it for any potential performance or security issues. For example, they might want to ensure that the exception message does not contain sensitive information that could be exposed to unauthorized users.
