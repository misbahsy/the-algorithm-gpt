[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/src/java/com/twitter/search/earlybird/exception/NotInServerSetUpdateException.java)

This code defines a custom exception class called `NotInServerSetUpdateException`. It extends the `ServerSet.UpdateException` class from the `com.twitter.common.zookeeper` package. This exception is used when attempting to leave a server set, but the current instance of the `Earlybird` class is already out of the server set.

The `ServerSet` class is a part of the Apache ZooKeeper project, which is a distributed coordination service. It is used to manage a set of servers that provide a particular service. The `Earlybird` class is likely a part of a larger project that uses ZooKeeper to manage server sets.

By extending the `ServerSet.UpdateException` class, this custom exception inherits all of the functionality of the parent class, while also adding additional functionality specific to the `NotInServerSetUpdateException`. This allows for more specific error handling and messaging when attempting to leave a server set.

Here is an example of how this exception may be used in the larger project:

```java
try {
  serverSet.leave();
} catch (ServerSet.UpdateException e) {
  if (e instanceof NotInServerSetUpdateException) {
    // Handle the case where Earlybird is already out of the server set
  } else {
    // Handle other types of ServerSet.UpdateException
  }
}
```

In this example, the `leave()` method is called on the `serverSet` object, which may throw a `ServerSet.UpdateException`. If the exception is an instance of `NotInServerSetUpdateException`, then the code can handle this specific case differently than other types of `ServerSet.UpdateException`. This allows for more granular error handling and better control over the behavior of the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ServerSet` class being imported?
- The `ServerSet` class is being used in this code to manage a set of servers that this application is running on.

2. What is the difference between `NotInServerSetUpdateException` and `ServerSet.UpdateException`?
- `NotInServerSetUpdateException` is a custom exception that extends `ServerSet.UpdateException`. It is used specifically when trying to leave a server set when the application is already out of the server set.

3. What is the significance of the `message` parameter in the constructor of `NotInServerSetUpdateException`?
- The `message` parameter is used to provide additional information about the exception that occurred. It can be used to give more context to the developer or user about what went wrong.
