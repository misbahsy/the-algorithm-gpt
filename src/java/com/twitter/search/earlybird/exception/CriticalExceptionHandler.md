The `CriticalExceptionHandler` class is used for handling exceptions that are considered critical in the Earlybird project. This class is responsible for shutting down Earlybirds if they are still starting up and incrementing a counter that will cause alerts if Earlybirds have already started. 

The `handle` method takes in an instance of the class where the exception was thrown and the exception itself. If the exception is null, the method returns. Otherwise, it calls the `handleFatalException` method to handle the exception. If an unexpected exception occurs while handling the original exception, the method logs an error.

The `handleFatalException` method takes in an instance of the class where the exception was thrown and the exception itself. It logs a fatal error message with the class name and the exception. If the exception is considered fatal, it increments the `CRITICAL_EXCEPTION_COUNT` counter. If Earlybirds are still starting up, the method logs an error message and shuts them down. If the `shutdownHook` is not set, the method logs an error message. If the environment is not a test environment, the method sleeps for 3 minutes to allow the fatal exception to be caught by observability. Finally, the method terminates the JVM.

The `shouldIncrementFatalExceptionCounter` method takes in the exception and returns a boolean value indicating whether the `CRITICAL_EXCEPTION_COUNT` counter should be incremented. If the exception is an `InternalError` caused by an unsafe memory access operation, the method increments the `UNSAFE_MEMORY_ACCESS` counter and returns false. Otherwise, the method returns true.

This class is used to handle critical exceptions in the Earlybird project. It can be used to shut down Earlybirds if they are still starting up and increment a counter that will cause alerts if Earlybirds have already started. Developers can use the `ExceptionCauser` helper class to verify that their code handles exceptions as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used for handling critical exceptions in the Earlybird project from Twitter. It shuts down Earlybirds if they are still starting and increments a counter that will cause alerts if they have already started.

2. What are the two things that might happen when an exception is handled with this class?
- If Earlybirds are still starting, they will be shut down. If Earlybirds have started, a counter will be incremented that will cause alerts.

3. What is the purpose of the `UNSAFE_MEMORY_ACCESS` counter?
- The `UNSAFE_MEMORY_ACCESS` counter is used to keep track of InternalErrors caused by unsafe memory access operations, which are usually triggered by SIGBUS for accessing a corrupted memory block. It is used to avoid getting pages when this happens.
