The code above defines a custom exception class called `BadRequestException`. This exception is thrown when a client sends a request to the server that is malformed or invalid. The purpose of this class is to provide a way for the server to communicate to the client that their request was not properly formatted and cannot be processed.

The `BadRequestException` class extends the built-in `Exception` class, which means that it inherits all of its properties and methods. The class has two constructors, one that takes a message and a cause, and another that takes just a message. The message parameter is a string that describes the reason for the exception, while the cause parameter is an optional parameter that specifies the underlying cause of the exception.

This class can be used in the larger project to handle errors that occur when processing client requests. For example, if a client sends a request to the server with an invalid parameter, the server can throw a `BadRequestException` with a message that explains the problem. The client can then catch this exception and display an appropriate error message to the user.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a larger project:

```
try {
  // process client request
} catch (BadRequestException e) {
  // handle bad request error
  System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, the `process` method is called to handle the client request. If the request is invalid, a `BadRequestException` is thrown with a message that explains the problem. The catch block then handles the exception by printing an error message to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a custom exception class called BadRequestException in the com.twitter.search.earlybird.exception package.

2. When would this exception be thrown?
   This exception would be thrown when a bad request is made, as indicated by the name of the exception class.

3. How would this exception be handled in the code?
   The code that calls methods that could potentially throw this exception would need to handle it using a try-catch block or by declaring that it throws the exception.
