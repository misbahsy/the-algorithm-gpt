The `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class is a utility class that executes a single periodic task. It extends the `ScheduledExecutorManager` class and implements the `Closeable` interface. It provides three constructors that take different parameters to create an instance of the class. 

The `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class has a `ScheduledExecutorTask` object and a `PeriodicActionParams` object as instance variables. The `ScheduledExecutorTask` object is used to execute the periodic task, and the `PeriodicActionParams` object is used to specify the parameters for the periodic task.

The `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class provides a `schedule()` method that schedules the single internally specified task returned by the `getScheduledTask()` method. The `getScheduledTask()` method returns the `ScheduledExecutorTask` object that was created during the construction of the `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` object.

The `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class also provides an abstract `runOneIteration()` method that must be implemented by the subclass. This method contains the code that the task executes.

The `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class is used in the larger project to execute a single periodic task. It provides a simple way to schedule and execute a task at a specified interval. Here is an example of how to use the `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class:

```
OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager manager = new OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager(
    executorServiceFactory,
    threadNameFormat,
    isDaemon,
    periodicActionParams,
    shutdownTiming,
    searchStatsReceiver,
    criticalExceptionHandler
) {
    @Override
    protected void runOneIteration() {
        // Code to execute the periodic task
    }
};

ScheduledFuture future = manager.schedule();
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class and pass in the required parameters. We also implement the `runOneIteration()` method to contain the code that the task executes. Finally, we call the `schedule()` method to schedule the task and get a `ScheduledFuture` object that can be used to cancel the task if needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an abstract class called `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` that executes a single periodic task using a scheduled executor service.

2. What are the parameters required to create an instance of `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager`?
- An instance of `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` can be created by passing a `ScheduledExecutorServiceFactory`, a thread name format, a boolean indicating whether the thread should be a daemon thread or not, `PeriodicActionParams`, `ShutdownWaitTimeParams`, `SearchStatsReceiver`, and `CriticalExceptionHandler`.

3. What is the purpose of the `runOneIteration()` method?
- The `runOneIteration()` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by any class that extends `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager`. It defines the code that the task executes.
