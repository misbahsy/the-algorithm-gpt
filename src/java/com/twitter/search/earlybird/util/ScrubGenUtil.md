The `ScrubGenUtil` class in the `com.twitter.search.earlybird.util` package provides a helper method to parse a scrub gen from a string to a date. The class uses the `FastDateFormat` class from the `org.apache.commons.lang3.time` package to format the date. The `SCRUB_GEN_DATE_FORMAT` constant is an instance of `FastDateFormat` that formats the date in the `yyyyMMdd` format. 

The `parseScrubGenToDate` method takes a string `scrubGen` as input and returns a `Date` object. The method uses the `parse` method of `SCRUB_GEN_DATE_FORMAT` to parse the `scrubGen` string into a `Date` object. If the `scrubGen` string is malformed and cannot be parsed, the method throws a `RuntimeException` with an error message indicating the malformed date.

This class is likely used in the larger project to parse scrub gen dates from strings into `Date` objects. Scrub gen dates are used to identify the version of the data that is being processed. The parsed `Date` objects can then be used to compare scrub gen dates and determine if one version of the data is newer than another. 

Example usage of the `parseScrubGenToDate` method:

```
String scrubGen = "20220101";
Date date = ScrubGenUtil.parseScrubGenToDate(scrubGen);
```

In this example, the `scrubGen` string is `"20220101"`, which represents January 1, 2022. The `parseScrubGenToDate` method parses this string into a `Date` object and returns it in the `date` variable. The `date` variable can then be used to compare scrub gen dates with other `Date` objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a helper method to parse a scrub gen from String to date.

2. What is a scrub gen and why is it important to parse it to a date?
- It is not clear from this code what a scrub gen is, but it is important to parse it to a date because it is likely used in some time-sensitive context where the date is relevant.

3. Why is the constructor for ScrubGenUtil private?
- The constructor is private to prevent instantiation of the class, as it only contains static methods and should not be instantiated.
