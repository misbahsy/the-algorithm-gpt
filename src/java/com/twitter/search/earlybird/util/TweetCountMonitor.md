The `TweetCountMonitor` class in this code is a background task that periodically retrieves and exports the number of tweets per hour indexed by the Earlybird search engine. This is particularly useful for ensuring that no data is missing for any hours in the search archives.

The class iterates through all the segments indexed by Earlybird and examines the `createdAt` dates for all documents in each segment. It also keeps track of and exposes the number of hours that do not have any tweets in the min/max range of data indexed on Earlybird.

The `updateHourlyCounts()` method is responsible for updating the hourly tweet counts. It iterates through the current index to count all tweets and field hits, and then updates the counts based on the new data.

The `getNewTweetCountMap()` method loops through all segments and documents in each segment, and for each document, gets the `createdAt` timestamp (in seconds) from the `TimeMapper`. Based on that, it returns a map with the count of the number of tweets for each hour and the number of tweets corresponding to each field for each hour.

The `TweetCountMonitor` class can be used in the larger project to monitor the tweet indexing process and ensure that the search engine is not missing any data for any hours in the search archives. This can help improve the accuracy and reliability of the search engine.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetCountMonitor` class and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `TweetCountMonitor` class is a background task that periodically gets and exports the number of tweets per hour that are indexed on the earlybird (Twitter's search engine). It is used to ensure that no data is missing for any hours in the search archives. The task loops through all the segments indexed by the earlybird and looks at the createdAt dates for all the documents in each segment. It also keeps track of and exposes the number of hours that do not have any tweets in the min/max range of data that is indexed on the earlybird.

2. **Question**: How does the `TweetCountMonitor` class handle missing data or hours without tweets?
   **Answer**: The `TweetCountMonitor` class keeps track of the number of hours that do not have any tweets in the min/max range of data that is indexed on the earlybird. It exposes this information as a stat, which can be used to monitor and address any missing data or hours without tweets.

3. **Question**: What are the main methods in the `TweetCountMonitor` class and what do they do?
   **Answer**: Some of the main methods in the `TweetCountMonitor` class include:
   - `updateHourlyCounts()`: Updates the hourly tweet counts by iterating through all segments and documents in each segment.
   - `getNewTweetCountMap()`: Loops through all segments and documents in each segment, and returns a map with the count of the number of tweets for each hour and the number of tweets corresponding to each field for each hour.
   - `runOneIteration()`: Runs one iteration of the background task, updating the hourly tweet counts and logging the results.
