The ActionLogger class is a utility class that provides methods for logging the start and end of an action, along with the time it took to complete. This class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes in the project to provide detailed logging information about the actions being performed.

The class contains two methods: call() and run(). Both methods take a message and a function as input parameters. The message is a string that describes the action being performed, and the function is the code that performs the action. The call() method returns a value, while the run() method does not.

When either method is called, it logs a message indicating that the action is starting. It then creates a stopwatch object to measure the time it takes to complete the action. The function is then executed, and if it throws an exception, the method logs an error message indicating that the action failed. Finally, the method logs a message indicating that the action has finished, along with the time it took to complete.

The ActionLogger class is useful for providing detailed logging information about the actions being performed in the project. For example, if the project is a search engine, the ActionLogger class could be used to log the start and end of each search query, along with the time it took to complete. This information could then be used to optimize the search engine and improve its performance.

Here is an example of how the ActionLogger class could be used in a search engine project:

```
public class SearchEngine {
  private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SearchEngine.class);

  public List<Result> search(String query) {
    List<Result> results = new ArrayList<>();
    try {
      ActionLogger.run("Search query: " + query, () -> {
        // Perform search query and populate results list
      });
    } catch (Exception e) {
      LOG.error("Search failed: " + query, e);
    }
    return results;
  }
}
```

In this example, the search() method logs a message indicating that a search query is starting, and then calls the ActionLogger.run() method to execute the search query. If the search query throws an exception, the method logs an error message indicating that the search failed. Finally, the method returns the results of the search.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a utility class called `ActionLogger` that logs messages at the start and end of a function and the time it took to run.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the `google guava` library for the `Stopwatch` class and the `slf4j` library for logging.

3. What is the difference between the `call` and `run` methods in this code?
- The `call` method is used for functions that return a value, while the `run` method is used for functions that do not return a value. Both methods log a message at the start and end of the function and the time it took to run.
