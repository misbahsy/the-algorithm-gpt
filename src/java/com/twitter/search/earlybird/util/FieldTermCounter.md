The `FieldTermCounter` class is used to count the number of times a field occurs in hourly and daily stats. It is used by `TermCountMonitor` to iterate all fields in the index. The exception is that this class is also used to count the number of tweets in the index. Under this situation, the passed-in `fieldName` would be an empty string (as `TWEET_COUNT_KEY`).

The class has several instance variables that are used to store the minimum count of hourly and daily stats, the start and end check hours, and the exported hourly and daily counts. The `runWithNewCounts` method updates the stats exported by this class based on the new counts provided in the given map. It does this by updating all existing hours, adding and exporting all new hours, filling in all the missing hours between known minimum and maximum days, and exporting as a stat how many hours don't have any tweets (i.e., <= 0).

The `updateExistingHourlyCounts` method updates the existing hourly count map based on the new hourly count map in the current iteration. If the hourly key matches from the new hourly map to the existing hourly count map, the value of the existing hourly count map is updated to the value from the new hourly count map. The `addAndExportNewHourlyCounts` method is called after the `updateExistingHourlyCounts` method so that all matching key-value pairs have been removed from the new hourly count map. It moves all remaining valid values from the new hourly count map to the existing hourly count map.

The `fillMissingHourlyCounts` method finds whether the existing hourly count map has hourly holes. If such holes exist, it fills 0 values so that they can be exported. The `exportMissingTweetStats` method exports the missing tweet stats. It rolls up the days and exports hourly too few tweets for index fields. It might consider whitelisting some high-frequency fields later. It also finds a day with too few tweets and exports it.

The class has several methods that are used for testing purposes. The `getHourValue` method returns the day in format "YYYYMMDDHH" as an int. The `getCalendarValue` method returns a calendar value for the given hour. The `getStatName` method returns the stat name for the given field, instance, and date.

Overall, the `FieldTermCounter` class is an important class in the larger project as it is used to count the number of times a field occurs in hourly and daily stats. It is also used to count the number of tweets in the index. The class has several methods that are used for testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the project?
- This class is used to count how many times a field happens in hourly and daily stats, and is used by TermCountMonitor for iterating all fields in the index. It is also used to count the number of tweets in the index when the passed in fieldName is an empty string.
2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `runWithNewCounts` method?
- The input of the `runWithNewCounts` method is a map of new counts for each hour, where the key is an integer representing the hour in the format "YYYYMMDDHH" and the value is a mutable integer. The output of the method is the updated stats exported by this class based on the new counts provided in the input map.
3. What is the purpose of the `getAggregatedNoTweetStatName` method?
- The `getAggregatedNoTweetStatName` method is used to generate the name of the stat that represents the number of hours or days with no indexed tweets for a specific field or for the index as a whole, depending on the value of the `hourly` parameter. The generated name is used to export the stat as a `SearchLongGauge`.
