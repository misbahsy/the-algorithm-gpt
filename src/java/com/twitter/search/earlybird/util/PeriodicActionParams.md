The `PeriodicActionParams` class is used to specify the timing and type of period actions that are scheduled in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is used to create objects that define the parameters for scheduling periodic actions using the `ScheduledExecutorService` class in Java.

The class has four private instance variables: `initialDelayDuration`, `intervalDuration`, `intervalUnit`, and `delayType`. The `initialDelayDuration` variable specifies the duration of the initial delay before the first run of the task. The `intervalDuration` and `intervalUnit` variables specify the duration and time unit of the delay between each run of the task. The `delayType` variable specifies the type of delay between runs, which can be either a fixed delay or a fixed rate.

The class has three public static methods that can be used to create `PeriodicActionParams` objects with different delay types and parameters. The `atFixedRate` method creates an object with a fixed rate delay type, which means that the task runs at a fixed rate regardless of how long it takes to complete. The `withIntialWaitAndFixedDelay` method creates an object with a fixed delay type, which means that there is a fixed delay between each run of the task, and an initial delay before the first run. The `withFixedDelay` method is a convenience method that calls `withIntialWaitAndFixedDelay` with an initial delay of 0.

The `isFixedDelay` method is a private helper method that returns a boolean indicating whether the delay type is fixed delay or fixed rate.

Overall, the `PeriodicActionParams` class provides a simple and flexible way to specify the timing and type of period actions that are scheduled in the larger project. By creating `PeriodicActionParams` objects with different parameters, the project can schedule periodic tasks with different delay types and intervals, depending on the specific requirements of each task. For example, a task that needs to run at a fixed rate regardless of how long it takes to complete can use the `atFixedRate` method, while a task that needs to run at a fixed interval with no overlap between runs can use the `withIntialWaitAndFixedDelay` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code specifies timing and type of period actions that are scheduled.

2. What is the difference between `atFixedRate` and `withFixedDelay` methods?
    
    `atFixedRate` runs start at times start, start+X, start+2*X etc., so they can possibly overlap, while `withFixedDelay` runs can't overlap.

3. What is the significance of the `isFixedDelay` method?
    
    The `isFixedDelay` method returns a boolean indicating whether the delay type is `FIXED_DELAY` or not.
