The EarlybirdSearchResultUtil class contains a set of static methods for constructing and manipulating ThriftSearchResult objects. These objects are used to represent search results in the Earlybird search engine. 

The class contains several methods for updating and setting various fields in a ThriftSearchResult object. For example, the setResultStatistics method updates the result statistics on a ThriftSearchResults object based on a SearchResultsInfo object. The setLanguageHistogram method populates the language histogram inside a ThriftSearchResults object. The prepareResultsArray and prepareRelevanceResultsArray methods write search results into a result array. 

The mergeSearchResults method merges a list of ThriftSearchResults objects into a single ThriftSearchResults object. This method aggregates the hit counts and language histograms from each search result, adds the results to the merged object, and updates the relevance statistics. 

These methods are used throughout the Earlybird search engine to construct and manipulate search results. For example, the prepareResultsArray method is used in the EarlybirdSearchHandler class to write search results into a result array. The mergeSearchResults method is used in the EarlybirdSearcher class to merge search results from multiple shards into a single result set. 

Overall, the EarlybirdSearchResultUtil class provides a set of utility methods for working with ThriftSearchResult objects in the Earlybird search engine.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility methods for constructing and manipulating ThriftSearchResult objects in the context of the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What is the significance of the MIN_LANGUAGE_RATIO_TO_KEEP constant?
- This constant is used to determine the minimum ratio of language counts to total counts required for a language to be included in the language histogram of a ThriftSearchResults object.

3. What is the difference between prepareResultsArray and prepareRelevanceResultsArray methods?
- The prepareResultsArray method is used to prepare a list of ThriftSearchResult objects from a SimpleSearchResults object, while the prepareRelevanceResultsArray method is used to prepare a list of ThriftSearchResult objects from a RelevanceSearchResults object, with additional options for setting a user ID whitelist and partition configuration.
