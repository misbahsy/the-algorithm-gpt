The `EarlybirdDecider` class is a Singleton that provides a global interface for guarding any code in Earlybird with a Decider key. It is a thin wrapper around the Twitter Decider library, which is a library for making decisions based on a percentage of traffic. The initializer requires EarlybirdConfig to be initialized already. The class provides three methods for checking if a feature is available based on randomness, based on the user, and for getting the raw decider value for a given feature. 

The `initialize()` method initializes the global decider accessor. It requires EarlybirdConfig to be initialized. It returns the new decider interface. The `initialize(String configPath)` method initializes the global decider accessor. It requires EarlybirdConfig to be initialized. It takes a path to the base decider config file as an argument. It returns the new decider interface. 

The `isFeatureAvailable(String feature)` method checks if a feature is available based on randomness. It takes the feature name to test as an argument. It returns true if the feature is available, false otherwise. The `isFeatureAvailable(String feature, Recipient recipient)` method checks if the feature is available based on the user. It takes the feature name to test and the recipient to base a decision on as arguments. It returns true if the feature is available, false otherwise. The recipient's ID is hashed and used as the value to compare with the decider percentage. Therefore, the same user will always get the same result for a given percentage, and higher percentages should always be a superset of the lower percentage users. The `getAvailability(String feature)` method gets the raw decider value for a given feature. It takes the feature name as an argument. It returns the integer value of the decider. 

The class has a logger object and a constant string `DECIDER_CONFIG` that holds the path to the decider config file. The class has a `checkInitialized()` method that checks if the `earlybirdDecider` is initialized. The class has a `getDecider()` method that returns the `earlybirdDecider`. The class has a `getMutableDecisionMaker()` method that returns the `mutableDecisionMaker`. 

This class is used in the larger Earlybird project to provide a global interface for guarding any code in Earlybird with a Decider key. It is used to check if a feature is available based on randomness or based on the user. It is also used to get the raw decider value for a given feature.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdDecider class?
- The EarlybirdDecider class is a Singleton that provides global access to a single decider configuration, allowing any code in Earlybird to be guarded by a Decider key.

2. What is the role of the initialize() method?
- The initialize() method initializes the global decider accessor and returns the new decider interface. It requires EarlybirdConfig to be initialized.

3. What is the difference between isFeatureAvailable() and getAvailability() methods?
- The isFeatureAvailable() method checks if a feature is available based on randomness or a recipient, while the getAvailability() method returns the integer value of the decider for a given feature.
