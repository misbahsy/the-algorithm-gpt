The `CoordinatedEarlybirdAction` class is a utility class for executing tasks on Earlybirds that need to be coordinated across replicas on the same hash partition. It can be used for coordinating optimization on the same timeslice. When enabled, a try-lock will be taken out in Zookeeper while the task is performed. The action will attempt to leave the partition's server set. If the attempt fails, the action is aborted.

The class has several configuration options, such as whether the action should be coordinated through Zookeeper, whether it should ensure that there are enough replicas in the server set, and how long to lock out all other replicas in the hash partition for. It also has methods for executing the action with or without coordination, and for retrying the action until it is successfully executed.

The `execute` method takes a description and a function as arguments. If the `shouldSynchronize` flag is set, it calls the `executeWithCoordination` method, which attempts to acquire a lock in Zookeeper, leaves the server set if necessary, and then executes the given function. If the lock cannot be acquired, a `CoordinatedEarlybirdActionLockFailed` exception is thrown.

The `retryActionUntilRan` method retries the action until it is successfully executed, with a variable sleep amount between retries to avoid implicit orderings.

The `joinServerSet` method is used to join back the server set after a coordinated action, with retries and sleeps in between. If the server cannot join the server set after the specified number of retries, a fatal flag is set, and a `CriticalExceptionHandler` is used to handle the situation.

The class also provides methods for setting the `shouldSynchronize` flag and for getting the number of coordinated function calls and coordinated leave server set calls, mainly for testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CoordinatedEarlybirdAction` class and how does it coordinate tasks across replicas on the same hash partition?
   **Answer**: The `CoordinatedEarlybirdAction` class is a utility class for executing tasks on Earlybirds that need to be coordinated across replicas on the same hash partition, such as coordinating optimization on the same timeslice. It uses a try-lock in Zookeeper to coordinate the tasks and ensures that there are enough replicas in the server set before leaving the server set to perform the action.

2. **Question**: How does the `execute` method work and what is the difference between executing with and without coordination?
   **Answer**: The `execute` method takes a description and a function as arguments. If the `shouldSynchronize` flag is set, it calls the `executeWithCoordination` method to perform the action with coordination, which involves acquiring a lock, leaving the server set, executing the action, and rejoining the server set. If the flag is not set, it simply calls the function without coordination.

3. **Question**: How does the `retryActionUntilRan` method work and when is it used?
   **Answer**: The `retryActionUntilRan` method is used to execute a given action repeatedly until it is successfully executed. It takes a description and a Runnable action as arguments. The method attempts to execute the action using the `execute` method, and if it fails due to a lock failure, it sleeps for a random amount of time before retrying. This process continues until the action is successfully executed.
