The `TermCountMonitor` class in this code is a background task that periodically calculates and exports the number of terms per field that are indexed in an Earlybird search system, averaged over all segments. This is specifically used to ensure that no terms are missing for any fields in the search archives.

The class extends `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` and overrides the `runOneIteration()` method, which is executed periodically. In this method, the `updateFieldTermCounts()` function is called to update the term counts for each field. The term counts are calculated by looping through all segments and getting the average term/token count for each field. The results are stored in a map (`rawCounts`) with field names as keys and `RawFieldCounter` objects as values.

The `updateFieldTermCounts()` function also updates the exported counts, term stats, token stats, and missing fields stats. It exports the term counts for all known fields as a stat and calculates the number of fields with low term counts (i.e., below a specified threshold).

The `TermCountMonitor` class also provides several methods for testing purposes, such as `getExportedCounts()`, `getFieldsWithLowTermCount()`, and `getMissingFields()`.

Example usage of this class in a larger project could involve creating a `TermCountMonitor` instance with the required dependencies (e.g., `SegmentManager`, `ScheduledExecutorServiceFactory`, etc.) and periodically running the `runOneIteration()` method to update and export term counts for each field in the search system. This would help in monitoring the indexed terms and ensuring that no terms are missing for any fields in the search archives.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TermCountMonitor` class and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `TermCountMonitor` class is a background task that periodically gets and exports the number of terms per field that are indexed on this earlybird, averaged over all segments. It is specifically used for making sure that no terms are missing for any fields in the search archives. The task loops through all the segments that are indexed by this earlybird, and for each segment, it looks at the term counts for all fields in that segment.

2. **Question**: How does the `TermCountMonitor` class handle missing fields or fields with low term counts?
   **Answer**: The `TermCountMonitor` class keeps track of the number of fields that do not have any term counts (or below the specified threshold) in the data that is indexed on this earlybird. It updates and exports the term counts for all known fields and exports the number of fields not having enough term counts as a stat.

3. **Question**: How is the `TermCountMonitor` class scheduled to run periodically?
   **Answer**: The `TermCountMonitor` class extends the `OneTaskScheduledExecutorManager` class, which handles the scheduling of the task. The run interval is configured using the `RUN_INTERVAL_MINUTES_CONFIG_NAME` constant, and the task is scheduled to run at a fixed rate using the `PeriodicActionParams.atFixedRate()` method.
