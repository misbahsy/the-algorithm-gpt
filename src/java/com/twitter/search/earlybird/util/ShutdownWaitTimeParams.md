The `ShutdownWaitTimeParams` class in the `com.twitter.search.earlybird.util` package specifies how much time to wait when shutting down a task. It contains two private fields: `waitDuration` and `waitUnit`, which represent the duration and unit of time to wait respectively. The class has a constructor that takes in these two parameters and sets them as instance variables. 

The class also has two static methods: `indeterminately()` and `immediately()`. The `indeterminately()` method returns a `ShutdownWaitTimeParams` instance that instructs the caller to wait indefinitely for the task to shut down. It achieves this by setting the `waitDuration` to `Long.MAX_VALUE` and the `waitUnit` to `TimeUnit.DAYS`. The `immediately()` method, on the other hand, returns a `ShutdownWaitTimeParams` instance that instructs the caller to shut down the task immediately. It achieves this by setting the `waitDuration` to `0` and the `waitUnit` to `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`.

This class can be used in the larger project to specify the amount of time to wait when shutting down a task. For example, if a task needs to be shut down gracefully, the `ShutdownWaitTimeParams` instance can be created with a specific duration and unit of time to wait before shutting down the task. This can help prevent data loss or corruption by allowing the task to complete any pending operations before shutting down. On the other hand, if the task needs to be shut down immediately, the `immediately()` method can be used to create a `ShutdownWaitTimeParams` instance that instructs the caller to shut down the task without waiting. 

Overall, the `ShutdownWaitTimeParams` class provides a simple and flexible way to specify the amount of time to wait when shutting down a task, which can be useful in ensuring the integrity of data and preventing data loss or corruption.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
    
    This class specifies how much time to wait when shutting down a task.

2. What are the parameters required to create an instance of this class?
    
    An instance of this class requires a wait duration (long) and a time unit (TimeUnit).

3. What are the use cases for the `indefinitely()` and `immediately()` methods?
    
    The `indefinitely()` method returns an instance that instructs the caller to wait indefinitely for the task to shut down, while the `immediately()` method returns an instance that instructs the caller to shut down the task immediately. These methods can be used to specify the wait time for shutting down a task in different scenarios.
