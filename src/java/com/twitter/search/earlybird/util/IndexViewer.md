The `IndexViewer` class in this code is responsible for providing various functionalities to view and analyze the data stored in a Twitter search index. It is designed to work with the `EarlybirdSingleSegmentSearcher` class, which represents a single segment of the search index.

The main functionalities provided by the `IndexViewer` class include:

1. **Dumping tweet data**: Given a tweet ID or a document ID, the `IndexViewer` can dump all the terms associated with the tweet, along with their frequencies and positions in the index. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the structure of the index.

2. **Dumping tweet IDs**: The `IndexViewer` can also dump all the tweet IDs present in the current segment of the index. This can be useful for analyzing the distribution of tweets across different segments.

3. **Dumping histograms**: The `IndexViewer` can generate histograms for the terms in the index, either for a specific field or for all fields. This can be useful for analyzing the distribution of terms and their frequencies in the index.

4. **Dumping data for specific terms**: The `IndexViewer` can dump data for specific terms in the index, including their document frequencies and associated documents. This can be useful for analyzing the occurrences of specific terms in the index.

5. **Dumping schema and fields**: The `IndexViewer` can dump the schema of the current segment, as well as the indexed fields. This can be useful for understanding the structure of the index and the fields that are being indexed.

6. **Dumping tweet ID to document ID mappings**: The `IndexViewer` can dump the mappings between tweet IDs and document IDs, as well as the associated segment and time slice information. This can be useful for understanding the relationship between tweets and documents in the index.

The `IndexViewer` class uses several helper methods and data transfer objects (DTOs) to perform these tasks, such as `TermDto`, `StatsDto`, and various methods for dumping data, histograms, and mappings. The class also provides options for customizing the output, such as specifying the character set, histogram buckets, and whether to dump hex terms.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `IndexViewer` class?**

   The `IndexViewer` class is responsible for providing various functionalities to view and analyze the index data, such as dumping tweet data, printing histograms, and displaying statistics for the indexed fields. It also provides methods to dump the schema and fields of the index, as well as methods to map tweet IDs to document IDs and vice versa.

2. **How does the `dumpData` method work and what are its parameters?**

   The `dumpData` method is used to print terms and optionally documents for the currently viewed index. It takes the following parameters:
   - `writer`: A `ViewerWriter` object used for writing the output.
   - `field`: The field to be dumped. If null, all fields will be dumped.
   - `term`: The term to be dumped. If null, all terms will be dumped.
   - `maxTerms`: The maximum number of terms to be printed per field. If null, 0 terms will be printed.
   - `maxDocs`: The maximum number of documents to be printed. If null, no documents will be printed.
   - `options`: An `Options` object containing various options for dumping out text.
   - `shouldSeekToTerm`: A boolean flag indicating whether to seek to the specified term before dumping data.

3. **How does the `dumpHistogram` method work and what are its parameters?**

   The `dumpHistogram` method is used to print the histogram for the currently viewed index. It takes the following parameters:
   - `writer`: A `ViewerWriter` object used for writing the output.
   - `field`: The field for which the histogram should be printed. If null, histograms for all fields will be printed.
   - `options`: An `Options` object containing various options for dumping out text, such as histogram buckets and term length histogram settings.
