The `QueryCacheManager` class is the main class responsible for managing Earlybird's QueryCache. It initializes the QueryCache and notifies the QueryCache subsystem of new segments. This class is thread-safe when calling methods that modify the list of tasks that are executing or when traversing all tasks and checking something. The way thread-safety is achieved here is through making methods synchronized.

The `QueryCacheManager` class has several methods that are used to manage the QueryCache. The `setupTasksIfNeeded` method sets up all update tasks at once and should only be called after Earlybird has loaded/indexed all segments during start-up. The `rebuildQueryCachesAfterSegmentOptimization` method rebuilds the query cache for the given segment after it was optimized. The `waitUntilAllQueryCachesAreBuilt` method blocks until all the tasks inside this manager have run at least once. The `update` method notifies the `QueryCacheManager` of a new list of segments we currently have, so that cache tasks can be updated. The `allTasksRan` method determines if all query cache tasks ran at least once (even if they failed). The `enabled` method determines if the query cache manager is enabled. The `getFilter` method returns the query cache filter with the given name. The `shutdown` method shuts down the query cache manager. The `setWorkerPoolSizeAfterStartup` method sets the worker pool size after startup.

The `QueryCacheManager` class has several instance variables that are used to manage the QueryCache. The `enabled` variable is a boolean that determines if the query cache manager is enabled. The `maxEnabledSegments` variable is an integer that represents the maximum number of enabled segments. The `userTable` variable is a `UserTable` object that represents the user table. The `userScrubGeoMap` variable is a `UserScrubGeoMap` object that represents the user scrub geo map. The `indexConfig` variable is an `EarlybirdIndexConfig` object that represents the Earlybird index configuration. The `updater` variable is a `QueryCacheUpdater` object that represents the query cache updater. The `filters` variable is a `Map` object that represents the query cache filters. The `updaterScheduledExecutorServiceFactory` variable is a `ScheduledExecutorServiceFactory` object that represents the updater scheduled executor service factory. The `searchStatsReceiver` variable is a `SearchStatsReceiver` object that represents the search stats receiver. The `searcherStats` variable is an `EarlybirdSearcherStats` object that represents the Earlybird searcher stats. The `decider` variable is a `Decider` object that represents the decider. The `criticalExceptionHandler` variable is a `CriticalExceptionHandler` object that represents the critical exception handler. The `clock` variable is a `Clock` object that represents the clock.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code manages Earlybird's QueryCache, which is used to cache search queries for faster retrieval. It solves the problem of slow search query performance by pre-computing and caching search queries.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries including Google Guava, SLF4J, Twitter Common, and Twitter Decider.

3. How is thread-safety achieved in this code?
- Thread-safety is achieved by making methods synchronized when modifying the list of tasks or traversing all tasks.
