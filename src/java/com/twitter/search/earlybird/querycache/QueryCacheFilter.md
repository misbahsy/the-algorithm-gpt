The `QueryCacheFilter` class defines a filter/entry for the query cache, including the filter name, the query used to populate the cache, update schedule, and other related information. This class is used to create instances of the filter/entry when loading the configuration file. 

The `QueryCacheFilter` class has several fields that are set directly from the YAML configuration file, including `filterName`, `query`, `resultType`, `cacheModeOnly`, `schedule`, and `queries`. The `filterName` is a unique name for the cached filter, while `query` is the serialized query string used to populate the cache. The `resultType` is the type of the results that will be generated by this query cache filter. The `cacheModeOnly` field is a boolean value that indicates whether the filter is in cache mode only. The `schedule` field is a list of `UpdateInterval` objects that define the update schedule for the filter. The `queries` field is a `SearchCounter` object that is used to keep track of the number of queries made to the filter.

The `QueryCacheFilter` class also has several methods that are used to set the values of the fields, including `setFilterName`, `setQuery`, `setResultType`, `setCacheModeOnly`, and `setSchedule`. These methods are called by the YAML loader when loading the configuration file. 

The `getQueryString` method returns the serialized query string used to populate the cache, while the `getResultSetType` method returns the type of the results that will be generated by this query cache filter. The `getCacheModeOnly` method returns a boolean value that indicates whether the filter is in cache mode only. The `getLuceneQuery` method returns the Lucene query object created from the serialized query string, while the `getSearchQuery` method returns the Thrift search query object created from the serialized query string. 

The `createQueryCounter` method creates a new `SearchCounter` object to keep track of the number of queries made to the filter, while the `incrementUsageStat` method increments the usage statistics for the filter. The `createSearchRequestInfo` method creates a new `SearchRequestInfo` object using the `queryPair` field. 

The `setup` method sets up the query cache filter using the `QueryCacheManager`, `UserTable`, and `EarlybirdCluster` objects. The `getUpdateInterval` method returns the update interval for the specified segment. 

The `sanityCheckFilterName` method checks the filter name for invalid characters, while the `sanityCheckSchedule` method checks the update schedule for missing or out-of-order intervals. The `sanityCheck` method checks the filter for missing or invalid fields. 

Overall, the `QueryCacheFilter` class is an important part of the query cache system used in the larger project. It defines the filters/entries that are used to populate the cache and provides methods for setting up and managing the filters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a QueryCache filter/entry and its properties, such as the name of the filter, the query used to populate the cache, update schedule, etc. It is used by the YAML loader when loading the config file. 

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries, including Google Guava, Apache Lucene, and Twitter Common. 

3. What is the significance of the `InvalidEntryException` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `InvalidEntryException` class is a custom exception that is thrown when there is an issue with the configuration of the QueryCache filter/entry. It is used to provide more detailed error messages to the user, including the name of the filter that caused the exception.
