The `QueryCacheConfig` class is responsible for loading and parsing a YAML configuration file that contains a list of `QueryCacheFilter` objects. The configuration file is loaded using the `locateConfigFile` method, which takes a file name as input and returns a `FileReader` object. If the file is not found, a warning message is logged and `null` is returned. If the file is found, a `FileReader` object is created and returned.

The `loadConfig` method is responsible for parsing the YAML configuration file and creating a list of `QueryCacheFilter` objects. It uses the SnakeYAML library to parse the YAML file and create Java objects. For each object in the YAML file, a `QueryCacheFilter` object is created and added to the list of filters. The `sanityCheck` method is called on each `QueryCacheFilter` object to ensure that it is valid. If a filter is invalid, a `RuntimeException` is thrown. Finally, a search counter is created for each filter using the `createCounter` method, and the list of filters is returned.

The `filters` method returns the list of `QueryCacheFilter` objects that were loaded from the configuration file. The `getFilterSize` method returns the number of filters in the list.

The `QueryCacheConfig` class is not thread-safe, so it should not be used to create multiple instances in different threads. The constructor takes a `SearchStatsReceiver` object as input, which is used to create search counters for each filter.

This class is used in the larger project to configure the query cache filters for the Earlybird search system. The configuration file contains a list of filters that are used to cache search queries and improve search performance. The `QueryCacheConfig` class is responsible for loading and parsing this configuration file, and creating a list of `QueryCacheFilter` objects that are used by the Earlybird search system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `QueryCacheConfig` that loads a YAML configuration file and creates a list of `QueryCacheFilter` objects based on the contents of the file.

2. What other classes does this code depend on?
    
    This code depends on several other classes from the `com.twitter.search` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird` packages, including `Config`, `SearchStatsReceiver`, and `EarlybirdConfig`.

3. Why is the `QueryCacheConfig` class not thread safe?
    
    The `QueryCacheConfig` class is not thread safe because it is designed to be created only once and accessed by a single thread. Creating multiple instances of the class in different threads could lead to race conditions and other synchronization issues.
