The `LuceneRelevanceQueryVisitor` class is a subclass of `EarlybirdLuceneQueryVisitor` and is responsible for visiting Lucene queries and generating a relevance score for each document. This class is part of the Earlybird search system, which is used by Twitter to index and search tweets.

The constructor of `LuceneRelevanceQueryVisitor` takes in several parameters, including an `ImmutableSchemaInterface` object, a `QueryCacheManager` object, a `UserTable` object, a `UserScrubGeoMap` object, a `TerminationTracker` object, a `Map<String, FieldWeightDefault>` object, a `Map<MappableField, String>` object, a `MultiSegmentTermDictionaryManager` object, a `Decider` object, an `EarlybirdCluster` object, and a `QueryTimeout` object. These parameters are used to initialize the superclass `EarlybirdLuceneQueryVisitor`.

The `visitSinceIDOperator` method is overridden in this class to handle the `since_id` operator. This operator is used to filter tweets based on their ID, but it is not relevant for relevance queries, so this method returns `null`.

This class is used in the larger Earlybird search system to generate relevance scores for tweets based on a Lucene query. The relevance scores are used to rank the tweets in search results. The `LuceneRelevanceQueryVisitor` class is one of several classes that work together to implement the Earlybird search system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `LuceneRelevanceQueryVisitor` that extends another class called `EarlybirdLuceneQueryVisitor`. It contains methods for visiting different types of search operators and returns a Lucene query object.
2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several external libraries including Google Guava, Apache Lucene, and Twitter's own Decider library.
3. What is the difference between the two constructors in this class?
   - The first constructor takes in several parameters including a `TerminationTracker` and a `QueryTimeout`, while the second constructor only takes in a few parameters and is marked as `@VisibleForTesting`. The second constructor is likely used for unit testing purposes.
