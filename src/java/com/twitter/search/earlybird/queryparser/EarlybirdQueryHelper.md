The `EarlybirdQueryHelper` class provides several static methods that help modify Lucene queries for use in the Earlybird search system. 

The `requireExcludeAntisocial` method takes a basic query and a `QueryCacheManager` object and returns a new query that excludes antisocial tweets. If the basic query already has an antisocial filter, the method returns the original query. Otherwise, it appends an antisocial filter to the query. If the `QueryCacheManager` is enabled, the method uses a cached filter to exclude antisocial tweets. Otherwise, it uses a filter that excludes tweets containing the `ANTISOCIAL` keyword.

The `maybeWrapWithHitAttributionCollector` method takes a Lucene query, a `Query` object, a `Schema.FieldInfo` object, and a `HitAttributeHelper` object and returns a new query that collects hit attribution data. If the `HitAttributeHelper` object is not null and the `Query` object is not null, the method wraps the Lucene query with a hit attribution collector that collects data for the given field and node rank. Otherwise, it returns the original query.

The `maybeWrapWithTimeout` method takes a Lucene query and a `QueryTimeout` object and returns a new query that enforces the given timeout. If the `QueryTimeout` object is not null, the method wraps the Lucene query with a `TerminationQuery` object that enforces the timeout. Otherwise, it returns the original query. 

Overall, this class provides methods that modify Lucene queries to exclude antisocial tweets, collect hit attribution data, and enforce timeouts. These methods are used in the Earlybird search system to improve search results and performance. 

Example usage:

```
Query basicQuery = new Query("hello world");
QueryCacheManager queryCacheManager = new QueryCacheManager();
Query modifiedQuery = EarlybirdQueryHelper.requireExcludeAntisocial(basicQuery, queryCacheManager);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EarlybirdQueryHelper` class?
- The `EarlybirdQueryHelper` class provides helper methods for modifying and wrapping Lucene queries with additional functionality such as hit attribution data collection and timeout enforcement.

2. What is the purpose of the `requireExcludeAntisocial` method?
- The `requireExcludeAntisocial` method wraps a given query and some clauses to exclude antisocial tweets into a conjunction. It checks if the query already has any antisocial filters set and if so, returns the original query. Otherwise, it adds an antisocial filter to the query.

3. What is the difference between the two `maybeWrapWithHitAttributionCollector` methods?
- Both `maybeWrapWithHitAttributionCollector` methods wrap a given query into an equivalent query that will also collect hit attribution data. The first method takes in a `Query` object and a `QueryNode` object storing the query, while the second method takes in a `Query` object and an integer `nodeRank` representing the rank of the query in the overall request query. The first method is used when the `QueryNode` object is available, while the second method is used when it is not.
