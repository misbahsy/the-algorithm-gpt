The `EarlybirdProductionFinagleServerManager` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of two Finagle servers: a warm-up server and a production server. The warm-up server is used to warm up the production server by pre-loading data and performing other tasks before the production server is started. The production server is the main server that handles incoming requests.

The class implements the `EarlybirdFinagleServerManager` interface, which defines methods for starting and stopping the warm-up and production servers. The class has two `AtomicReference` fields that hold references to the warm-up and production servers. The `isWarmUpServerRunning()` and `isProductionServerRunning()` methods check if the warm-up and production servers are running, respectively.

The `startWarmUpFinagleServer()` and `startProductionFinagleServer()` methods start the warm-up and production servers, respectively. Both methods take a `serviceIface`, `serviceName`, and `port` as arguments. The `serviceIface` is an interface that defines the methods that the server
