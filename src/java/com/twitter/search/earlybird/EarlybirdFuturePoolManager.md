The `EarlybirdFuturePoolManager` class is a future pool that delegates all calls to an underlying future pool, which can be recreated. This class is part of the Earlybird project from Twitter, which is a search engine for real-time tweets. 

The `EarlybirdFuturePoolManager` class implements the `FuturePool` interface, which is used to execute functions asynchronously and return a `Future` object that can be used to retrieve the result of the function. The `apply` method takes a `Function0` object, which represents a function that takes no arguments and returns a value of type `T`. The `apply` method returns a `Future` object that represents the result of the function.

The `EarlybirdFuturePoolManager` class has two methods to create and stop the underlying future pool. The `createUnderlyingFuturePool` method creates a new `ExecutorServiceFuturePool` object with an `ExecutorService` that is created by the `createExecutorService` method. The `stopUnderlyingFuturePool` method stops the current `ExecutorServiceFuturePool` object by shutting down its executor service and waiting for the specified timeout.

The `createExecutorService` method creates a new `ExecutorService` object with a fixed number of threads and an `ArrayBlockingQueue` with a maximum size. If the maximum queue size is less than or equal to zero, the method creates a `FixedThreadPool` with the specified number of threads. If the maximum queue size is greater than zero, the method creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with the specified number of threads, an `ArrayBlockingQueue` with the specified maximum size, and a `RejectedExecutionHandler` that throws a `RejectedExecutionException` when the queue is full.

The `EarlybirdFuturePoolManager` class also has methods to get the pool size, the number of active tasks, and the number of completed tasks. These methods delegate the calls to the underlying `ExecutorServiceFuturePool` object.

Overall, the `EarlybirdFuturePoolManager` class provides a way to execute functions asynchronously and manage the underlying executor service. It can be used in the Earlybird project to execute search queries asynchronously and handle the load of incoming tweets. Here is an example of how to use the `EarlybirdFuturePoolManager` class:

```
EarlybirdFuturePoolManager poolManager = new EarlybirdFuturePoolManager("search-pool");
poolManager.createUnderlyingFuturePool(10);

Future<String> futureResult = poolManager.apply(() -> {
  // execute search query and return result
  return "search result";
});

String result = futureResult.get();
System.out.println(result);

poolManager.stopUnderlyingFuturePool(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a future pool manager that delegates calls to an underlying future pool. It is used to manage the creation and stopping of the underlying future pool, and to apply functions to the pool. It is likely used in the larger project to manage concurrency and parallelism.

2. What is the significance of the `createUnderlyingFuturePool` and `stopUnderlyingFuturePool` methods?
- The `createUnderlyingFuturePool` method creates a new executor service with a fixed number of threads and a maximum queue size, and sets it as the underlying future pool. The `stopUnderlyingFuturePool` method shuts down the current executor service and waits for it to terminate before setting the underlying future pool to null. These methods are significant because they allow for the creation and stopping of the underlying future pool, which is necessary for managing concurrency and parallelism.

3. What is the purpose of the `createThreadFactory` method?
- The `createThreadFactory` method creates a new thread factory with a specified thread name format and daemon status. It is used to create threads for the executor service in the `createExecutorService` method. The purpose of this method is to provide a way to customize the thread factory used by the executor service.
