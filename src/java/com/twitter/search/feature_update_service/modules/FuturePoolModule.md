The `FuturePoolModule` class is responsible for providing a future pool backed by an executor service with a bounded thread pool and a bounded backing queue. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is a search feature update service. 

The `futurePool()` method provides a singleton instance of the `ExecutorServiceFuturePool` class. This method creates a future pool with a maximum of 100 threads, a maximum of 200 threads, and a maximum queue size of 2000. These limits are based on service capacity estimates and testing on staging, attempting to give the pool as many resources as possible without overloading anything. 

The `createFuturePool()` method is only visible for testing and creates an instance of `ExecutorServiceFuturePool`. This method takes three parameters: `corePoolSize`, `maximumPoolSize`, and `queueCapacity`. It creates a `LinkedBlockingQueue` with a capacity of `queueCapacity` and an `InterruptibleExecutorServiceFuturePool` with a `ThreadPoolExecutor` that has a `corePoolSize` of `corePoolSize`, a `maximumPoolSize` of `maximumPoolSize`, and a queue of `queue`. 

The `SearchCustomGauge.export()` method exports the metrics of the thread pool size and work queue size to the `FeatureUpdateStats` class. These metrics can be used to monitor the performance of the future pool. 

Overall, this class provides a future pool that can be used to execute tasks asynchronously. The bounded thread pool and backing queue ensure that the pool does not overload the system, and the metrics provide insight into the performance of the pool. 

Example usage:

```
ExecutorServiceFuturePool futurePool = injector.getInstance(ExecutorServiceFuturePool.class);
Future<String> future = futurePool.apply(() -> {
  // do some task asynchronously
  return "result";
});
String result = Await.result(future);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides a future pool backed by an executor service with bounded thread pool and bounded backing queue for the Twitter search feature update service.

2. What are the limits set for the thread pool and backing queue, and why were they chosen?
    
    The thread pool is limited to 100-200 threads, and the queue size is limited to 2000. These limits were chosen based on service capacity estimates and testing on staging, attempting to give the pool as many resources as possible without overloading anything.

3. What is the purpose of the `SearchCustomGauge` calls in the `createFuturePool` method?
    
    The `SearchCustomGauge` calls export metrics for monitoring the thread pool size and work queue size to the `FeatureUpdateStats` prefix.
