The `FeatureUpdateStats` class provides stat tracking for the feature update ingester service. It uses the `SearchRateCounter` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.metrics` package to track the rate of incoming requests and responses. The class has four instance variables, three of which are `ConcurrentHashMap` objects that store `SearchRateCounter` objects. 

The `clientRequest` method is called for each incoming request and increments the total request rate and the request rate for the specific client. The `clientResponse` method is called for each response and increments the response rate for the specific response code and the response rate for the specific client and response code. 

The `getRequestRateCount` method returns the total number of requests, while the `getClientRequestCount` method returns the total number of requests for a specific client. The `getResponseCodeCount` method returns the total number of responses for a specific response code, and the `getClientResponseCodeCount` method returns the total number of responses for a specific client and response code. 

The `clientRequestRateKey`, `responseCodeKey`, and `clientResponseCodeKey` methods are private helper methods that generate keys for the `ConcurrentHashMap` objects based on the client ID and response code. The `incrementPerClientCounter` method is a private helper method that increments the rate counter for a specific key in a thread-safe manner.

Overall, this class provides a way to track the performance of the feature update ingester service by recording metrics for incoming requests and responses. These metrics can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the service. 

Example usage:
```
FeatureUpdateStats stats = new FeatureUpdateStats();
stats.clientRequest("client1");
stats.clientResponse("client1", FeatureUpdateResponseCode.SUCCESS);
long totalRequests = stats.getRequestRateCount();
long clientRequests = stats.getClientRequestCount("client1");
long successResponses = stats.getResponseCodeCount(FeatureUpdateResponseCode.SUCCESS);
long clientSuccessResponses = stats.getClientResponseCodeCount("client1", FeatureUpdateResponseCode.SUCCESS);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for stat tracking of the feature update ingester service.

2. What metrics are being tracked?
- The code tracks the total request rate, request rate per client, rates per response code, and rates per client per response code.

3. What is the data structure being used to store the metrics?
- The metrics are being stored in ConcurrentHashMaps.
