The `FeatureUpdateResponseClassifier` class is a response classifier used in the feature update service of Twitter's search functionality. It extends the `AbstractPartialFunction` class from the Scala runtime library and overrides its `isDefinedAt` and `apply` methods. 

The `isDefinedAt` method always returns true, indicating that this classifier can handle any response. The `apply` method takes a `ReqRep` object, which represents a request-response pair, and returns a `ResponseClass` object, which classifies the response as either a success or a failure.

The `apply` method first extracts the response from the `ReqRep` object using the `response` method, which returns a `Try` object that may contain either the response or an exception if the request failed. If the `Try` object contains an exception, the method delegates to the default response classifier to handle the failure. Otherwise, it casts the response to a `FeatureUpdateResponse` object and extracts its `FeatureUpdateResponseCode`.

Based on the response code, the method returns a `ResponseClass` object that indicates whether the response is a success, a retryable failure, or a non-retryable failure. If the response code is `TRANSIENT_ERROR` or `SERVER_TIMEOUT_ERROR`, the method returns `ResponseClass.RetryableFailure()`, indicating that the request can be retried. If the response code is `PERSISTENT_ERROR`, the method returns `ResponseClass.NonRetryableFailure()`, indicating that the request should not be retried. If the response code is `CLIENT_CANCEL_ERROR`, the method returns `ResponseClass.Success()`, indicating that the request was cancelled by the client and should be treated as a success. For all other response codes, the method also returns `ResponseClass.Success()`, indicating that the server behaved correctly and the request was successful.

This classifier is used to determine how to handle responses from the feature update service, which updates the search index with new features. By classifying responses as successes or failures, the classifier enables the service to retry failed requests or stop retrying requests that are unlikely to succeed. For example, the classifier may be used in a Finagle client that sends requests to the feature update service and handles its responses based on their classification. 

Example usage:
```
FeatureUpdateResponseClassifier classifier = new FeatureUpdateResponseClassifier();
ReqRep request = new ReqRep(requestObject, responseObject);
ResponseClass responseClass = classifier.apply(request);
if (responseClass == ResponseClass.Success()) {
  // handle successful response
} else if (responseClass == ResponseClass.RetryableFailure()) {
  // retry request
} else {
  // handle non-retryable failure
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a custom response classifier for a Finagle service that handles feature update requests, mapping different response codes to different response classes.

2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?
   
   The `apply` method takes a `ReqRep` object as input and returns a `ResponseClass` object as output.

3. What response codes are classified as retryable failures?
   
   The `TRANSIENT_ERROR` and `SERVER_TIMEOUT_ERROR` response codes are classified as retryable failures.
