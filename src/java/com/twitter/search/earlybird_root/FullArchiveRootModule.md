The `FullArchiveRootModule` class is a module that provides configuration and dependencies for the Earlybird search service. This module is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is a search engine that allows users to search for tweets based on various criteria.

The purpose of this module is to provide caching and routing functionality for the Earlybird search service. It defines several caches that store the results of search queries, such as the `RecencyCache`, `RelevanceCache`, `StrictRecencyCache`, `TermStatsCache`, and `TopTweetsCache`. These caches are created using the `EarlybirdCacheCommonModule.createCache()` method, which takes a `JavaClient` object, a `DefaultForcedCacheMissDecider` object, and various configuration parameters as arguments.

The module also provides a `Service` object that handles search requests. This object is created using the `FullArchiveRootService` class, which implements the `EarlybirdService.ServiceIface` interface. The `FullArchiveRootService` class is responsible for processing search requests and returning search results.

In addition to these components, the module provides several other classes and interfaces that are used to configure and manage the Earlybird search service. For example, the `EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport` interface defines methods for scattering and gathering search requests, while the `EarlybirdServiceLoggingSupport` class provides logging functionality for the search service.

Overall, the `FullArchiveRootModule` module is an important part of the Earlybird search service, providing caching and routing functionality that helps to improve the performance and reliability of the search engine.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code is a module for a project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It provides caching, logging, and validation support for the EarlybirdService, which is a search service that retrieves tweets from Twitter's archive.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code has dependencies on several libraries and modules, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, Twitter Util, and Twitter Search Common. It also depends on a Java memcached client and a search decider.

3. What is the significance of the @Provides annotation in this code?
   
   The @Provides annotation is used to indicate that a method in this module provides a specific type of object that can be injected into other parts of the application. These objects include caches, logging support, and validation behavior for the EarlybirdService.
