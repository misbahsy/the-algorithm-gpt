The `EarlybirdChainedScatterGatherService` class is a chain of scatter gather services that is used by multi-tier roots. It extends the `Service` class and takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns a list of `Future` objects that contain `EarlybirdResponse` objects. 

The `EarlybirdChainedScatterGatherService` class has a constructor that takes in three parameters: `EarlybirdServiceChainBuilder`, `EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport`, and `PartitionLoggingSupport`. These parameters are used to build the `serviceChain` list, which is a list of `Service` objects that take in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and return an `EarlybirdResponse` object. 

The `apply` method is overridden to hit all tiers in parallel. It creates a new list called `resultList` that will hold the results of each tier. It then iterates through the `serviceChain` list and applies each `Service` object to the `requestContext` object. The result of each `Service` object is added to the `resultList`. Finally, the `resultList` is returned as a `Future` object.

This class is used in the larger project to handle multi-tier roots. It allows for parallel processing of requests across multiple tiers, which can improve performance and reduce latency. 

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdChainedScatterGatherService service = new EarlybirdChainedScatterGatherService(serviceChainBuilder, scatterGatherSupport, partitionLoggingSupport);
List<Future<EarlybirdResponse>> results = service.apply(requestContext).get();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code defines a chain of scatter gather services used by multi-tier roots in the Earlybird component of the Twitter search system.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they being used?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including Guava, SLF4J, and Finagle. These dependencies are being used to build and execute the scatter gather service chain.

3. What happens if the service chain is empty?
- If the service chain is empty, an error message is logged and a RuntimeException is thrown with the message "Root does not work with all tiers disabled."
