The code defines a class called EarlybirdFullArchiveScatterGatherSupport that extends another class called EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport. This class is used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the full archive tiers. 

The class takes two parameters in its constructor: PartitionMappingManager and EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger. These parameters are injected using the @Inject annotation. 

The purpose of this class is to provide support for scatter-gather operations in the Earlybird service. Scatter-gather is a technique used to parallelize processing of large datasets. In this case, the EarlybirdFullArchiveScatterGatherSupport class is used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the full archive tiers. 

The class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing large amounts of data. The EarlybirdFullArchiveScatterGatherSupport class is used to improve the efficiency of this processing by parallelizing requests to the earlybird partitions. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
EarlybirdFullArchiveScatterGatherSupport scatterGatherSupport = new EarlybirdFullArchiveScatterGatherSupport(partitionMappingManager, featureSchemaMerger);
scatterGatherSupport.scatterGather(request);
```

In this example, a new instance of EarlybirdFullArchiveScatterGatherSupport is created with the necessary parameters. The scatterGather method is then called on this instance with a request object as a parameter. This method will fan out the request to the earlybird partitions in the full archive tiers, improving the efficiency of processing large datasets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is an implementation of EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the full archive tiers.

2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?
   - This code requires the javax.inject and com.twitter.search.common packages to be imported.

3. What is the significance of the EarlybirdCluster.FULL_ARCHIVE parameter?
   - The EarlybirdCluster.FULL_ARCHIVE parameter is used to specify the cluster to which the scatter-gather requests will be fanned out. In this case, it is the full archive tier.
