The `MultiwayMergeCollector` class is a generic class that provides functionality for merging multiple responses from different partitions in a distributed system. The class takes in a custom comparator and returns a list of results sorted by the comparator. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The `MultiwayMergeCollector` class has a constructor that takes in two parameters: `numResponses` and `comparator`. The `numResponses` parameter specifies the number of responses to merge, while the `comparator` parameter specifies the custom comparator to use for sorting the results. The class also has a list of results that is initially empty, and a counter that keeps track of the number of responses added.

The `MultiwayMergeCollector` class has three methods: `addResponse()`, `collectResults()`, and `isResponseValid()`. The `addResponse()` method takes in an `EarlybirdResponse` object and adds it to the list of results. The method first checks if the number of responses added is less than the number of responses to merge. If the number of responses added is greater than or equal to the number of responses to merge, an exception is thrown. The method then checks if the response is valid by calling the `isResponseValid()` method. If the response is not valid, the method returns without adding the response to the list of results. If the response is valid, the method calls the `collectResults()` method to retrieve a list of results to be appended to the list of results.

The `collectResults()` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses of the `MultiwayMergeCollector` class. The method takes in an `EarlybirdResponse` object and returns a list of results to be appended to the list of results.

The `isResponseValid()` method is also an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses of the `MultiwayMergeCollector` class. The method takes in an `EarlybirdResponse` object and returns a boolean value indicating whether the response is valid or not.

The `getResultsList()` method returns the full list of results after all responses have been added. The method sorts the list of results using the custom comparator specified in the constructor and returns the sorted list.

Overall, the `MultiwayMergeCollector` class provides a generic way to merge multiple responses from different partitions in a distributed system. The class can be extended by subclasses to provide custom logic for collecting results and validating responses. The class is useful in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, where it can be used to merge responses from different partitions in a distributed system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a generic multiway merge collector class for doing k-way merge of earlybird responses that takes a comparator and returns a list of results sorted by the comparator.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Guava library for Preconditions and Lists, and the SLF4J library for logging.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The expected input of this code is an EarlybirdResponse object, and the output is a list of results sorted by the comparator. The number of responses to merge is specified in the constructor.
