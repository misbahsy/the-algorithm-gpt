The `RelevanceMergeCollector` class is a Java class that extends the `RecencyMergeCollector` class and is used to perform a k-way merge of earlybird responses, but sorted by relevance score. The purpose of this class is to collect and merge search results from multiple sources and sort them by relevance score. 

The class imports several other classes from the `com.twitter.search` package, including `ResultComparators`, `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil`, `EarlybirdResponse`, and `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats`. 

The `RelevanceMergeCollector` constructor takes an integer parameter `numResponses` and calls the constructor of the `RecencyMergeCollector` class with `numResponses` and `ResultComparators.SCORE_COMPARATOR` as parameters. 

The `collectStats` method is overridden in this class to collect statistics from the `EarlybirdResponse` object. If the `searchResults` object of the `response` parameter does not have relevance statistics, the method returns. Otherwise, if the `finalResults` object does not have relevance statistics, it creates a new `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStats` object and sets it to `finalResults`. Then, it adds the relevance statistics of the `response` object to the `finalResults` object using the `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil.addRelevanceStats` method. 

This class is used in the larger project to merge search results from multiple sources and sort them by relevance score. It is a superset of functionality found in the `RelevanceCollector` class, and any changes made to this class should be evaluated to see if they should be made in the `RelevanceCollector` class as well. 

Example usage of this class would involve creating an instance of `RelevanceMergeCollector` with the desired number of responses and calling its `collectStats` method with `EarlybirdResponse` objects to merge and sort the search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a Java class called `RelevanceMergeCollector` that extends another class called `RecencyMergeCollector`. It is used to perform a k-way merge of earlybird responses sorted by relevance score. It is part of a package called `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.collectors` and is likely used in a search-related feature of the project.

2. What is the difference between this class and `RelevanceCollector`?
- The code comments state that `RelevanceMergeCollector` is a superset of functionality found in `RelevanceCollector`. Changes made to `RelevanceMergeCollector` should be evaluated to see if they should also be made in `RelevanceCollector`. It is unclear from this code what the specific differences are between the two classes.

3. What is the purpose of the `collectStats` method and how is it used?
- The `collectStats` method is an overridden method from the `RecencyMergeCollector` class that is used to collect relevance statistics from an `EarlybirdResponse`. If the `EarlybirdResponse` does not have relevance statistics, the method returns early. Otherwise, it adds the relevance statistics to the final results using a utility method from `ThriftSearchResultsRelevanceStatsUtil`. It is unclear from this code where the final results are used or how they are accessed.
