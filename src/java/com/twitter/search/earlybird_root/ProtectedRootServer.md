The `ProtectedRootServer` class is a subclass of `SearchRootServer` and is used to create a server that provides access to the `EarlybirdService` interface. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter and is used to protect the root server from unauthorized access.

The `ProtectedRootServer` class takes two parameters in its constructor: `ProtectedRootService svc` and `Service<byte[], byte[]> byteSvc`. The `ProtectedRootService` is an implementation of the `EarlybirdService.ServiceIface` interface, which is used to define the methods that can be called on the server. The `Service<byte[], byte[]> byteSvc` is a Finagle service that handles the byte-level communication between the server and the client.

The `@Inject` annotation is used to indicate that the constructor should be used for dependency injection. This means that the `ProtectedRootServer` class can be instantiated and used by other classes in the project without having to manually create instances of its dependencies.

Overall, the `ProtectedRootServer` class is an important component of the larger project as it provides a secure way to access the `EarlybirdService` interface. This allows other parts of the project to interact with the server and perform various operations related to search and analysis of data. Here is an example of how the `ProtectedRootServer` class can be used:

```
ProtectedRootService svc = new ProtectedRootService();
Service<byte[], byte[]> byteSvc = new SomeByteService();
ProtectedRootServer server = new ProtectedRootServer(svc, byteSvc);
server.start();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `ProtectedRootServer` that extends `SearchRootServer` and takes in a `ProtectedRootService` and a `Service<byte[], byte[]>` as parameters.

2. What is the relationship between `ProtectedRootServer` and `EarlybirdService`?
   `ProtectedRootServer` is a subclass of `SearchRootServer` that takes in an interface of `EarlybirdService` as a generic type parameter. This suggests that `ProtectedRootServer` is related to `EarlybirdService` in some way, but the exact nature of the relationship is not clear from this code alone.

3. What is the purpose of the `@Inject` annotation?
   The `@Inject` annotation is used to indicate that the constructor for `ProtectedRootServer` should be automatically called by a dependency injection framework. This suggests that `ProtectedRootServer` is intended to be used in a larger application that uses dependency injection.
