The `TrimStats` class is used to track and record statistics related to the trimming of search results. It contains several private fields that keep track of the number of times certain situations are encountered during the trimming process. These fields include `maxIdFilterCount`, `minIdFilterCount`, `removedDupsCount`, and `resultsTruncatedFromTailCount`.

The class provides several methods to manipulate these fields. For example, `increaseMaxIdFilterCount()` and `increaseMinIdFilterCount()` are used to increment the `maxIdFilterCount` and `minIdFilterCount` fields, respectively. Similarly, `decreaseMaxIdFilterCount()` and `decreaseMinIdFilterCount()` are used to decrement these fields. The `increaseRemovedDupsCount()` method is used to increment the `removedDupsCount` field, and the `setResultsTruncatedFromTailCount()` method is used to set the `resultsTruncatedFromTailCount` field to a specific value.

The class also provides several getter methods to retrieve the values of these fields. For example, `getMinIdFilterCount()` returns the value of the `minIdFilterCount` field, and `getRemovedDupsCount()` returns the value of the `removedDupsCount` field.

Finally, the class overrides the `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the object. This method returns a string that contains the values of all the fields in the `TrimStats` object.

Overall, the `TrimStats` class is used to keep track of statistics related to the trimming of search results. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes in the larger project to optimize search results and improve performance. For example, the statistics tracked by this class could be used to identify areas where search results are being unnecessarily truncated or where duplicate results are being returned. This information could then be used to refine the search algorithm and improve the overall search experience.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the larger project?
   - This class tracks statistics related to trimming search results and is likely used by other classes in the search functionality of the project.
2. What do the different variables and methods in this class represent?
   - The variables represent counts of different types of trimming that have occurred, while the methods are used to modify these counts.
3. Why are some methods public while others are protected or package-private?
   - The methods that are public are likely intended to be used by other classes in the same package or even outside of the package, while the protected and package-private methods are only intended to be used within the same package.
