The `TierResponseAccumulator` class is a Java class that is part of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. This class is responsible for accumulating and merging search results from different tiers of the Earlybird system. 

The Earlybird system is a distributed search system that partitions search queries across multiple servers or "tiers". Each tier processes a subset of the search query and returns its own set of search results. The `TierResponseAccumulator` class is responsible for merging these results across all tiers and returning a single set of search results to the user.

The `TierResponseAccumulator` class extends the `ResponseAccumulator` class and overrides several of its methods to handle tier-specific logic. The `TierResponseAccumulator` class maintains a list of `TierResponse` objects, which represent the search results from each tier. It also keeps track of the total number of partitions queried across all tiers and the number of successful partitions.

The `TierResponseAccumulator` class provides several methods for handling different types of responses. The `handleSkippedResponse` method is called when a tier returns no search results. The `handleErrorResponse` method is called when a tier returns an error response. The `extraSuccessfulResponseHandler` method is called when a tier returns a successful response.

The `shouldEarlyTerminateMerge` method is used to determine whether to terminate the merge process early. This method takes a `EarlyTerminateTierMergePredicate` object as an argument, which is used to determine whether to terminate the merge process based on the number of search results returned.

The `getPartitionCounts` method returns a `PartitionCounts` object, which contains information about the number of partitions queried and the number of successful partitions across all tiers.

Overall, the `TierResponseAccumulator` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system, responsible for merging search results across multiple tiers and returning a single set of search results to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a class called `TierResponseAccumulator` that extends `ResponseAccumulator`. It accumulates responses from different tiers and merges them. It is likely part of a larger project that involves searching on Twitter.

2. What is the significance of the `totalPartitionsQueriedInAllTiers` and `totalSuccessfulPartitionsInAllTiers` variables?
- `totalPartitionsQueriedInAllTiers` is the total number of partitions the request was sent to, across all tiers. `totalSuccessfulPartitionsInAllTiers` is the number of partitions that returned successful responses. These variables are used to record tier stats and are important for determining whether to early terminate the merge.

3. What is the purpose of the `shouldEarlyTerminateMerge` method and how is it used?
- The `shouldEarlyTerminateMerge` method determines whether to early terminate the merge based on the number of search results and whether an early termination condition has been found. It is used to decide whether to continue merging responses or to stop early and return the accumulated responses.
