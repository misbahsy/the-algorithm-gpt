The TopTweetsResponseMerger class is a merger class that is used to merge EarlybirdResponse objects for the TopTweets ranking mode. This class extends the EarlybirdResponseMerger class and overrides some of its methods to provide specific functionality for merging TopTweets responses.

The class takes in an EarlybirdRequestContext object, a list of Future<EarlybirdResponse> objects, and a ResponseAccumulator mode object as parameters. The constructor of the class calls the constructor of the superclass and passes in these parameters.

The class has a static final double variable named SUCCESSFUL_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD, which is set to 0.9. This variable is used to determine the success threshold for merging responses. The class also has a static final SearchTimerStats variable named TIMER, which is used to measure the time taken to merge responses.

The class overrides the getMergedResponseTimer() method of the superclass and returns the TIMER variable. This method is used to get the timer that is used to measure the time taken to merge responses.

The class also overrides the getDefaultSuccessResponseThreshold() method of the superclass and returns the SUCCESSFUL_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD variable. This method is used to get the success threshold for merging responses.

The class overrides the internalMerge() method of the superclass to provide specific functionality for merging TopTweets responses. The method first checks that the search query is set and that the ranking mode is set to TopTweets. It then computes the number of results to keep and creates a RelevanceMergeCollector object. The method then adds the responses to the collector and gets all the search results. If the number of results requested is less than the number of search results, the method sets the search results to the first n results. Finally, the method sets the search results of the merged response to the search results obtained from the collector and returns the merged response.

Overall, the TopTweetsResponseMerger class is an important class in the Earlybird project as it provides specific functionality for merging TopTweets responses. It is used to merge EarlybirdResponse objects for the TopTweets ranking mode and can be used in the larger project to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a Java class that merges EarlybirdResponse objects for the TopTweets ranking mode.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code uses the Guava library for Preconditions and the Twitter Util library for Future.

3. What is the significance of the SUCCESSFUL_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD constant?
   
   The SUCCESSFUL_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD constant is used to determine the minimum percentage of successful responses required for the merged response to be considered successful.
