The `ResponseAccumulator` class in this code is responsible for accumulating and processing EarlybirdResponse objects, which are responses from the Twitter search service. The main purpose of this class is to determine when to early terminate the search process based on the accumulated responses.

The class maintains several data structures to store successful responses, error responses, maximum and minimum status IDs, and other related information. It provides methods to add new responses, handle successful responses, handle error responses, and handle skipped responses (e.g., when a partition or tier is skipped).

The `addResponse` method is used to add a new EarlybirdResponse to the accumulator. It updates the number of responses, searched segments, and other related statistics. Depending on the response type, it calls the appropriate handler method to process the response.

The `handleSuccessfulResponse` method records a successful response, updates the number of results accumulated, and records the minimum and maximum searched status IDs. It also updates the statistics related to these IDs.

The `handleErrorResponse` and `handleSkippedResponse` methods are abstract and should be implemented by subclasses to handle error and skipped responses, respectively.

The `getAccumulatedResults` method returns an `AccumulatedResponses` object containing the accumulated results, error responses, max and min status IDs, and other related information.

This class can be extended by other classes to implement specific response accumulation strategies for different types of searches, such as merging results from partitions within a single tier or merging results across different tiers.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ResponseAccumulator` class and how does it work with Earlybird responses?
   **Answer**: The `ResponseAccumulator` class is responsible for accumulating Earlybird responses, determining when to early terminate, and handling different types of responses (successful, error, and skipped). It maintains various statistics and counters related to the responses and provides methods to handle and process them accordingly.

2. **Question**: How does the `ResponseAccumulator` class handle different types of Earlybird responses (successful, error, and skipped)?
   **Answer**: The `ResponseAccumulator` class provides separate methods for handling different types of responses: `handleSuccessfulResponse()` for successful responses, `handleErrorResponse()` for error responses, and `handleSkippedResponse()` for skipped responses. These methods are responsible for updating the corresponding data structures and statistics based on the type of response.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `MinMaxSearchedIdStats` inner class and how is it used in the `ResponseAccumulator` class?
   **Answer**: The `MinMaxSearchedIdStats` inner class is responsible for maintaining various statistics related to the minimum and maximum searched status IDs in the Earlybird responses. It provides methods to increment these statistics and get their current values. The `ResponseAccumulator` class uses an instance of this inner class to update the statistics when processing successful responses with the `handleSuccessfulResponse()` method.
