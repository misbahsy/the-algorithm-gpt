The `StrictRecencyResponseMerger` class is a specialized version of the `RecencyResponseMerger` class that prioritizes not losing results during pagination. It is used by Gnip to ensure that scrolling returns all results. The class is responsible for merging search results from different partitions and tiers in a way that minimizes the number of pagination requests and ensures that no results are missed during pagination.

The merging logic for the Realtime cluster and Full archive cluster is different and is explained in detail in the code comments. The main difference between `StrictRecencyResponseMerger` and the base class `RecencyResponseMerger` is in the way it handles the `minSearchedStatusID` and `maxSearchedStatusID` values during the merging process. This ensures that no results are lost during pagination.

The class overrides several methods from the base class, such as `findMaxFullySearchedStatusID`, `findMinFullySearchedStatusID`, `trimResults`, `setMergedMinSearchedStatusId`, and `clearEarlyTerminationIfReachingTierBottom`. These methods are customized to handle the specific requirements of the `StrictRecencyResponseMerger` class.

For example, the `setMergedMinSearchedStatusId` method is different from the base class version because it always takes the `minResultId` when it is bigger than the `currentMergedMin`. This ensures that no results are lost during pagination.

In summary, the `StrictRecencyResponseMerger` class is designed to merge search results from different partitions and tiers in a way that ensures no results are lost during pagination and minimizes the number of pagination requests. It does this by customizing the merging logic and overriding several methods from the base `RecencyResponseMerger` class.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `StrictRecencyResponseMerger` class and how does it differ from the base `RecencyResponseMerger` class?
   **Answer**: The `StrictRecencyResponseMerger` class is a specialized implementation of the `RecencyResponseMerger` class that prioritizes not losing results during pagination. It is used by Gnip to ensure that scrolling returns all results. The merging logic is different from the base class, as it takes a more careful approach in handling min and max searched status IDs to avoid losing results during pagination.

2. **Question**: How does the `getTrimmingMinId()` method work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `getTrimmingMinId()` method determines the minimum ID to which all results should be trimmed. It checks if the current cluster is an archive cluster or not. If it's not an archive cluster, it returns the maximum of all minIds. If it's an archive cluster, it calculates the maximum of early-terminated minIds and the minimum of all minIds, and returns the appropriate value based on whether there are any early-terminated responses.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `clearEarlyTerminationIfReachingTierBottom()` method and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `clearEarlyTerminationIfReachingTierBottom()` method is responsible for clearing the early termination flag on the merged response if the minimum searched status ID of the merged response is the same as the tier bottom ID. This is done to ensure that when the "least deep" partition in the realtime cluster is exhausted, it's time to move to the full archive cluster. If the condition is met, the method sets the early termination flag to false and unsets the merged early termination reasons.
