The `EarlybirdResponseDebugMessageBuilder` class is responsible for collecting debug messages to attach to an `EarlybirdResponse`. The class contains methods for appending debug messages, logging warnings, and logging response debug information. The debug messages are stored in a `StringBuilder` and can be retrieved using the `debugString()` method. 

The class also contains methods for logging information about the success or failure of a search query. For example, the `logBelowSuccessThreshold` method logs a warning message if the number of successful responses returned from partitions is lower than a specified threshold. The `logResponseDebugInfo` method logs debug information about an `EarlybirdResponse`, including the response code and any search results.

This class is likely used in the larger project to provide additional information about search queries and responses for debugging purposes. The debug messages collected by this class can be used to identify and diagnose issues with search queries and responses. The class is part of a larger system for searching Twitter data called Earlybird, which likely includes other classes for processing search queries and responses. 

Example usage:
```
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();
// set request parameters
EarlybirdResponseDebugMessageBuilder builder = new EarlybirdResponseDebugMessageBuilder(request);
// perform search query
EarlybirdResponse response = performSearchQuery(request);
builder.logResponseDebugInfo(request, "partitionTierName", response);
String debugString = builder.debugString();
```
