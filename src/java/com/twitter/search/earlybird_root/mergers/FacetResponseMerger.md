The `FacetResponseMerger` class in this code is responsible for merging facets of `EarlybirdResponse` objects. Facets are a way to categorize and filter search results based on specific attributes. In the context of Twitter, this could include attributes like language, user, or hashtags. The main purpose of this class is to aggregate and process the facet information from multiple `EarlybirdResponse` objects and create a single, merged response.

The class extends the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` class and overrides the `internalMerge` method to handle the merging of facet information. It starts by preparing a `facetFieldInfoMap` which stores information about each facet field. Then, it iterates through all the successful responses and populates the map with the facet information from each response.

After collecting the facet information, the class aggregates the top facets and updates the merged response. It also handles various ranking options, such as minimum count, maximum penalty count, and excluding possibly sensitive facets. The class ensures that the merged response only includes facets that meet the specified criteria.

Additionally, the class takes care of deduplicating image facets and merging `twimg` results. It also updates the `numHitsProcessed` and `numPartitionsEarlyTerminated` fields in the `ThriftSearchResults` object of the merged response.

Here's an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```java
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = ...;
List<Future<EarlybirdResponse>> responses = ...;
ResponseAccumulator mode = ...;
FacetResponseMerger merger = new FacetResponseMerger(requestContext, responses, mode);
EarlybirdResponse mergedResponse = merger.merge();
```

In summary, the `FacetResponseMerger` class is responsible for merging and processing facet information from multiple `EarlybirdResponse` objects, ensuring that the final merged response meets the specified criteria and ranking options.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `FacetResponseMerger` class and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `FacetResponseMerger` class is responsible for merging facets from multiple `EarlybirdResponse` objects. It processes the responses, builds a facet info map, aggregates the top facets, and updates the blender response accordingly.

2. **Question**: What is the role of the `internalMerge` method in the `FacetResponseMerger` class?
   **Answer**: The `internalMerge` method is responsible for merging the facets from the `EarlybirdResponse` objects. It processes the responses, builds a facet info map, aggregates the top facets, and updates the blender response accordingly.

3. **Question**: How does the `collectResponsesAndPopulateMap` method work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `collectResponsesAndPopulateMap` method iterates through the backend responses and fills up the `FacetFieldInfo` map and the `userIDWhitelist` set. It processes the responses and populates the facet field info map and user ID whitelist accordingly.
