This code defines an abstract class `EarlybirdResponseMerger` that provides the base functionality for merging `EarlybirdResponse` objects in the context of the Twitter search algorithm. The class is designed to handle two types of merges: merging responses within a tier from different partitions and merging responses from multiple tiers.

The `EarlybirdResponseMerger` class has several key methods:

- `merge()`: This method initiates the merge process and returns a `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` object. It handles exceptions, checks if the `minSearchedStatusID` is higher than the max ID in the request, and decides whether to early terminate the merge process based on the number of results obtained so far.
- `internalMerge(EarlybirdResponse response)`: This abstract method should be implemented by derived classes to provide the specific logic for merging different types of results (recency, relevance, Top Tweets, etc.).
- `getDefaultSuccessResponseThreshold()`: This abstract method should be implemented by derived classes to provide the default success response threshold value.

The class also provides utility methods for aggregating hit counts, computing the number of results to keep, trimming exact duplicates, and truncating results based on the number of results requested.

`EarlybirdResponseMerger` can be extended by other classes to implement specific merging strategies for different types of search requests, such as `FacetResponseMerger`, `TermStatisticsResponseMerger`, `RecencyResponseMerger`, `StrictRecencyResponseMerger`, `RelevanceResponseMerger`, and `TopTweetsResponseMerger`.

In the larger project, this class would be used to merge search results from different partitions or tiers to provide a unified search result to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` class?**

   The `EarlybirdResponseMerger` class is responsible for merging EarlybirdResponse objects from multiple partitions or tiers based on the mode (recency, relevance, Top Tweets, etc.). It contains the basic logic to merge these responses and provides abstract methods for derived classes to implement specific merging logic for different types of results.

2. **How does the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` handle errors during the merging process?**

   The `EarlybirdResponseMerger` handles errors by converting them to a null response or an `EarlybirdResponse` with an appropriate error code (e.g., `CLIENT_CANCEL_ERROR`, `SERVER_TIMEOUT_ERROR`, or `TRANSIENT_ERROR`). It then proceeds with the merging process, taking into account the success ratio of the responses. If the success ratio is below the threshold, the merged response will be marked as a failure.

3. **How does the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` decide whether to early terminate the merging process?**

   The `shouldEarlyTerminateTierMerge` method determines whether to early terminate the merging process based on the total number of results from successful shards and whether an early termination has already been found. If there are enough results (at least one) or an early termination has been found, the method returns true, indicating that the merging process can be terminated early.
