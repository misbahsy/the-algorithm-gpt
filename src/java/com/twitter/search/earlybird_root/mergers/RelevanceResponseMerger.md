The `RelevanceResponseMerger` class is responsible for merging relevance search `EarlybirdResponse` objects. It extends the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` class and overrides its methods to implement the specific merging logic for relevance search. 

The `internalMerge` method is the main method that performs the merging. It first checks if the search query is set to relevance mode and then gets the results in score order using the `RelevanceMergeCollector`. It then trims the results using the `trimResults` method, which removes exact duplicates and truncates the results to the requested number. It also sets the feature schema in the response using the `featureSchemaMerger` object. Finally, it aggregates the hit count and language histograms from all the queries and sets them in the merged response.

The `shouldEarlyTerminateTierMerge` method checks if any of the partitions have an early termination and if the total number of results from successful shards is less than the requested number of results. If so, it increments a counter and returns true to early terminate the tier merge.

The `aggregateLanguageHistograms` method merges the per-language count map from all the responses and returns the merged map.

The `findMinFullySearchedStatusID` and `findMaxFullySearchedStatusID` methods find the minimum and maximum status IDs that have been searched, respectively.

The `trimResults` method trims the search results by removing exact duplicates and truncating the results to the requested number. It returns a `TrimStats` object that contains statistics about how many results were removed.

The `publishNumResultsFromPartitionStatistics` method keeps track of all the results that were kept after merging and increments the appropriate counter for each successful response to count how many of its results were kept post-merge.

Overall, the `RelevanceResponseMerger` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system that performs the merging of relevance search results. It implements the specific logic for relevance search and provides methods to aggregate hit count and language histograms from all the queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class that serves as a merger for relevance search EarlybirdResponse objects.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries, including Guava, SLF4J, and Twitter Search Common.

3. What is the significance of the "numPartitions" variable?
- The "numPartitions" variable represents the number of partitions used in the search, and is used to update partition statistics when merging responses.
