The `TermStatisticsResponseMerger` class is a merger class that merges `EarlybirdResponse` objects for term statistics. This class is part of the Earlybird search system from Twitter. 

The purpose of this class is to merge the results of term statistics requests from multiple backends. It takes a list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects and merges them into a single `EarlybirdResponse` object. The merged response contains the merged term statistics results from all the backends.

The `TermStatisticsResponseMerger` class extends the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` class and overrides some of its methods. The `internalMerge` method is the main method that merges the term statistics results. It uses the `ThriftTermResultsMerger` class to merge the term statistics results from all the backends. The merged results are then added to the `EarlybirdResponse` object.

The `shouldEarlyTerminateTierMerge` method always returns false. This is because accurate term statistics require results from all the backends, and early termination can lead to inaccurate results.

The `TermStatisticsResponseMerger` class is used in the Earlybird search system to merge term statistics results from multiple backends. It is part of a larger system that provides search functionality for Twitter. 

Example usage:

```java
List<Future<EarlybirdResponse>> responses = getResponsesFromBackends();
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = getRequestContext();
TermStatisticsResponseMerger merger = new TermStatisticsResponseMerger(requestContext, responses, ResponseAccumulator.MERGE);
EarlybirdResponse mergedResponse = merger.merge();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a Java class that merges termstats EarlybirdResponse objects.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code uses the following external libraries: 
   - Google Guava (com.google.common.collect.Collections2)
   - SLF4J (org.slf4j.Logger, org.slf4j.LoggerFactory)
   - Twitter Search Common Metrics (com.twitter.search.common.metrics.SearchTimerStats)
   - Twitter Search Earlybird Thrift (com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift)

3. What is the significance of the SUCCESSFUL_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD constant?
   
   The SUCCESSFUL_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD constant is used to determine the minimum percentage of successful responses required for the merge to be considered successful. The default value is 0.9, meaning that at least 90% of the responses must be successful for the merge to be considered successful.
