The `RecencyResponseMerger` class in this code is responsible for merging `EarlybirdResponse` objects from different partitions or tiers in a recency search. The main purpose of this class is to combine search results from multiple sources while maintaining the correct order and ensuring that the final merged response is consistent with the requested search parameters.

The `internalMerge` method is the core of this class, which takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object and merges it with other responses. It first finds the minimum and maximum status IDs that have been completely searched across all partitions. Then, it creates a `RecencyMergeCollector` and adds the responses to it. The search results are then trimmed based on the merged minimum and maximum status IDs.

The `trimResults` method is responsible for filtering and truncating the search results based on the merged minimum and maximum status IDs. It ensures that the final merged response contains the correct number of results as requested by the user. If there are not enough results after trimming, the method tries to backfill older and newer results until the desired number of results is reached.

The `shouldEarlyTerminateTierMerge` method determines if the merged response should be early-terminated when it has exactly as many trimmed results as requested and is not early-terminated due to other reasons.

The `RecencyResponseMerger` class also provides various utility methods for handling the merging process, such as `findMinFullySearchedStatusID`, `findMaxFullySearchedStatusID`, and `filterResultsByMergedMinMaxIds`. These methods help in finding the appropriate status IDs and filtering the search results based on the merged minimum and maximum status IDs.

In summary, the `RecencyResponseMerger` class plays a crucial role in the recency search algorithm by merging search results from different partitions or tiers, ensuring the correct order of results, and maintaining consistency with the requested search parameters.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `RecencyResponseMerger` class?
   **Answer**: The `RecencyResponseMerger` class is responsible for merging recency search `EarlybirdResponse` objects. It handles trimming and filtering of search results based on the searched range and the number of requested results, as well as managing early termination conditions for tier merges.

2. **Question**: How does the `RecencyResponseMerger` handle early termination for trimmed results?
   **Answer**: The `RecencyResponseMerger` sets early termination for trimmed results by checking if the end results were trimmed in any way, either by truncation or filtering based on min/max ranges. If the results were trimmed, the early termination flag is set to true and the appropriate early termination reasons are added to the `EarlyTerminationInfo` object.

3. **Question**: How does the `RecencyResponseMerger` handle trimming of search results based on the searched range?
   **Answer**: The `RecencyResponseMerger` trims search results based on the searched range by first filtering out results outside the merged min/max status IDs. If there are not enough results after filtering, it tries to backfill older results and then newer results until the requested number of results is reached. The trimmed results are then returned.
