The `SuperRootResponseMerger` class in this code is responsible for merging search results from different sources (realtime, protected, and full archive clusters) in a Twitter search algorithm project. The main purpose of this class is to combine the search results from these sources into a single, coherent response that can be returned to the user.

The class has a constructor that takes a `ThriftSearchRankingMode`, an `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger`, and a `Clock` as parameters. These are used to configure the ranking mode for merging results, the feature schema merger for merging feature schemas from different tiers, and the clock for merging results, respectively.

The `mergeResponseFutures` method is the main entry point for merging responses. It takes four parameters: an `EarlybirdRequestContext`, a `Future<EarlybirdServiceResponse>` for realtime response, a `Future<EarlybirdServiceResponse>` for protected response, and a `Future<EarlybirdServiceResponse>` for full archive response. This method returns a `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` containing the merged results.

The `mergeResponses` method is responsible for merging the given responses from the realtime, protected, and full archive clusters. It first merges the results from the realtime and protected clusters, then adds the results from the full archive cluster. The merged results are then sorted based on the ranking mode (relevance or recency) and trimmed if necessary.

The `mergePublicAndProtectedRealtimeResults` method is responsible for merging the realtime and protected results, taking into account the full archive results for generating anchor points. It adds the protected results to the realtime results, ensuring that the results are within the specified range of tweet IDs.

The `setMinSearchedStatusId` and `setMaxSearchedStatusId` methods are responsible for setting the minSearchedStatusID and maxSearchedStatusID fields on the merged response, respectively. These fields are used to indicate the range of tweet IDs that were searched during the merging process.

The `handleResponseException` method is responsible for handling exceptions thrown while merging responses. Timeout exceptions are converted to SERVER_TIMEOUT_ERROR responses, while all other exceptions are converted to PERSISTENT_ERROR responses.

Overall, this class plays a crucial role in the Twitter search algorithm project by combining search results from different sources into a single, coherent response that can be returned to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SuperRootResponseMerger` class and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `SuperRootResponseMerger` class is responsible for merging search results from different sources (realtime, protected, and full archive clusters) based on the ranking mode and other criteria. It provides methods to merge responses, results, and debug strings from these sources and handles exceptions that may occur during the merging process.

2. **Question**: How does the `mergePublicAndProtectedRealtimeResults` method work, and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `mergePublicAndProtectedRealtimeResults` method is responsible for merging tweets from protected and realtime clusters. It takes into account the number of requested results, the realtime response, the protected response, and the full archive response (used only for generating anchor points). The method follows a specific algorithm to prioritize public tweets and merge the results accordingly. It returns a list of merged search results.

3. **Question**: How does the `handleResponseException` method handle exceptions thrown while merging responses?
   **Answer**: The `handleResponseException` method handles exceptions thrown during the merging process by converting them into appropriate `EarlybirdResponseCode` values. If the exception is a timeout exception, it sets the response code to `SERVER_TIMEOUT_ERROR`. For all other exceptions, it sets the response code to `PERSISTENT_ERROR`. The method then returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object with the appropriate response code and a debug string containing the exception details.
