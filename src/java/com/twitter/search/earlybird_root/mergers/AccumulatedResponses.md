The `AccumulatedResponses` class is a collection of responses and associated statistics from multiple Earlybird searches that have been merged together. It is used to aggregate the results of multiple searches into a single response. 

The class contains four lists: `successResponses`, `errorResponses`, `maxIds`, and `minIds`. The `successResponses` list contains all the successful responses from the Earlybird searches. The `errorResponses` list contains all the unsuccessful responses from the Earlybird searches. The `maxIds` and `minIds` lists contain the maximum and minimum status IDs seen in each Earlybird search. 

The class also contains an `EarlyTerminationInfo` object, which provides information about why the Earlybird searches were terminated early. There is a boolean flag `isMergingAcrossTiers` that indicates whether the searches were performed across multiple tiers. The `PartitionCounts` class contains information about the number of partitions and the number of successful partitions in each tier.

The `getMergedErrorResponse()` method returns a merged `EarlybirdResponse` object that propagates as much information from the error responses as possible. If all error responses have the same error response code, the merged response will have the same error response code, and the debugString/debugInfo on the merged response will be set to the debugString/debugInfo of one of the merged responses. If the error responses have at least 2 different response codes, TRANSIENT_ERROR will be set on the merged response. Also, the method looks for the most common error response code and propagates the debugString/debugInfo from an error response with that response code.

Overall, the `AccumulatedResponses` class is an important part of the Earlybird search algorithm, as it allows the results of multiple searches to be combined into a single response. This class is used extensively throughout the Earlybird search codebase.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the AccumulatedResponses class?
- The AccumulatedResponses class is a collection of EarlybirdResponses and associated stats to be merged.

2. What is the purpose of the getMergedErrorResponse() method?
- The getMergedErrorResponse() method tries to return a merged EarlybirdResponse that propagates as much information from the error responses as possible.

3. What is the purpose of the isMergingAcrossTiers() method?
- The isMergingAcrossTiers() method returns a boolean indicating whether the merging is happening across tiers.
