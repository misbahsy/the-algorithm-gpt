The `RecencyAndRelevanceCachePostProcessor` class is a cache post-processor that is used in the Earlybird search system at Twitter. The purpose of this class is to process the cache response and return an optional `EarlybirdResponse` object. This class extends the `EarlybirdCachePostProcessor` class and overrides the `processCacheResponse` method.

The `processCacheResponse` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and an `EarlybirdResponse` object as input parameters. It first checks if the original request has a search query set. If it does, it tries to parse the query and extract the since and max IDs. If the query cannot be parsed, it logs an error and returns an absent optional. If the query is null, it sets the ID ranges to null. It then sets the since and max IDs to optional values based on the ID ranges. Finally, it calls the `postProcessCacheResponse` method to process the cache response and return an optional `EarlybirdResponse` object.

The `postProcessCacheResponse` method takes an `EarlybirdRequest`, an `EarlybirdResponse`, a since ID, and a max ID as input parameters. It calls the `CacheUtil.postProcessCacheResult` method to post-process the cache result and return an optional `EarlybirdResponse` object.

Overall, this class is used to process the cache response and return an optional `EarlybirdResponse` object based on the original request and the ID ranges extracted from the search query. It is used in the Earlybird search system at Twitter to improve the performance and efficiency of the search queries. An example usage of this class would be in a search query that requires filtering by recency and relevance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a cache post-processor for the Earlybird search service from Twitter, which processes cache responses and returns an optional EarlybirdResponse object.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    
    This code uses the Guava library for Optional and Preconditions classes, as well as the SLF4J library for logging.

3. What is the input and output of the `processCacheResponse` method?
    
    The `processCacheResponse` method takes an EarlybirdRequestContext object and an EarlybirdResponse object as input, and returns an Optional<EarlybirdResponse> object as output.
