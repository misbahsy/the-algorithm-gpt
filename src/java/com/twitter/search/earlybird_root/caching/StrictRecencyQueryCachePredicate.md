The `StrictRecencyQueryCachePredicate` class is a part of the caching module of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. The purpose of this class is to provide a predicate that can be used to determine whether a query should be cached or not based on certain conditions. 

The class extends the `QueryCachePredicate` class and takes in two parameters in its constructor: a `SearchDecider` object and a `normalizedSearchRootName` string. The `SearchDecider` object is used to determine whether the strict recency cache is enabled or not, while the `normalizedSearchRootName` string is used to create a unique key for the cache. 

The `shouldQueryCache` method is overridden to provide the logic for determining whether a query should be cached or not. It takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns a `Boolean` value. The method checks whether the request type is `STRICT_RECENCY`, whether caching is allowed for the request, and whether the strict recency cache is enabled or not. If all these conditions are met, the method returns `true`, indicating that the query should be cached. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

This class is used in the larger Earlybird search system to improve the performance of search queries by caching the results of certain queries. The strict recency cache is a type of cache that stores the results of queries that are executed frequently and have a strict recency requirement. By using this cache, the system can avoid executing the same query multiple times and instead return the cached results, thereby improving the response time of the system. 

An example of how this class can be used in the Earlybird search system is as follows:

```
SearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();
String normalizedSearchRootName = "example_search_root";
StrictRecencyQueryCachePredicate predicate = new StrictRecencyQueryCachePredicate(decider, normalizedSearchRootName);

EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();
requestContext.setEarlybirdRequestType(EarlybirdRequestType.STRICT_RECENCY);
requestContext.setRequest(new SearchRequest("example query"));
Boolean shouldCache = predicate.shouldQueryCache(requestContext);

if (shouldCache) {
  // execute query and cache results
} else {
  // execute query without caching
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `StrictRecencyQueryCachePredicate` that extends `QueryCachePredicate` and provides a method to determine whether a query should be cached based on certain conditions.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code imports several classes from different packages, including `SearchDecider` and `EarlybirdRequestContext`, and relies on the `EarlybirdRequestUtil` class from the `EarlybirdRequestUtil` package.

3. What is the significance of the `strictRecencyCacheEnabledDeciderKey` variable?
   - This variable is used to generate a key that is used to check whether the cache for strict recency queries is enabled or not. It is based on the normalized search root name passed to the constructor.
