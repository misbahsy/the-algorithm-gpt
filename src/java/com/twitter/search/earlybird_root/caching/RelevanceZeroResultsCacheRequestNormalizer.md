The RelevanceZeroResultsCacheRequestNormalizer class is a cache request normalizer that is part of the caching module of The Algorithm from Twitter project. The purpose of this class is to normalize search requests before they are cached. Normalization is the process of transforming a search request into a canonical form that can be compared to other requests for the purpose of caching. The normalization process removes any differences between requests that do not affect the search results, such as differences in capitalization, punctuation, or word order.

This class extends the CacheRequestNormalizer class, which is a generic class that takes two type parameters: the request context type and the request type. In this case, the request context type is EarlybirdRequestContext, which is a custom class defined in the same package, and the request type is EarlybirdRequest, which is a Thrift-generated class that represents a search request.

The normalizeRequest method is the main method of this class. It takes an EarlybirdRequestContext object as input and returns an Optional<EarlybirdRequest> object. The Optional class is a wrapper class that can contain either a non-null value or a null value. In this case, the Optional object contains either a normalized search request or no value at all.

The method first checks if the search query is personalized or not by calling the queryIsPersonalized method of the SearchQueryNormalizer class. If the query is not personalized, it means that the query has already been normalized by another cache request normalizer, and there is no need to normalize it again. In this case, the method returns an absent Optional object, which means that there is no value to return.

If the query is personalized, the method calls the normalizeRequestForCache method of the CacheUtil class to normalize the request. This method removes all personalization fields from the request and returns a new request object that can be cached. The method then returns an Optional object that contains either the normalized request or no value at all.

This class is used in the caching module of The Algorithm from Twitter project to improve the performance of search queries by caching the results of previous queries. By normalizing search requests before they are cached, the caching module can avoid caching duplicate requests and improve cache hit rates. The RelevanceZeroResultsCacheRequestNormalizer class is specifically designed to handle personalized search queries that have zero results, which are common in Twitter search. By normalizing these queries, the caching module can avoid unnecessary lookups in the cache and improve the overall performance of the search system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a cache request normalizer for the Earlybird search service at Twitter. It checks if a search query is personalized and if not, it returns an absent optional. If it is personalized, it strips personalization fields and normalizes the request for caching.

2. What other classes or methods does this code interact with?
   
   This code interacts with several other classes and methods from the `com.twitter.search` and `com.twitter.search.common.caching` packages, including `CacheUtil`, `SearchQueryNormalizer`, and `CacheRequestNormalizer`.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
   
   The expected input of this code is an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object, which contains a search query and other request parameters. The expected output is an `Optional` object that may or may not contain an `EarlybirdRequest` object, depending on whether the query is personalized or not.
