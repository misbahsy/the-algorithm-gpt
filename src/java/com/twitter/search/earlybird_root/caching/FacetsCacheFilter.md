The `FacetsCacheFilter` class is a cache filter used for facet requests in the Earlybird search system. It extends the `CacheFilter` class and takes in three generic types: `EarlybirdRequestContext`, `EarlybirdRequest`, and `EarlybirdResponse`. 

The purpose of this class is to filter and cache facet requests made to the Earlybird search system. It takes in a cache, a search decider, and a normalized search root name as constructor parameters. The cache is used to store the results of facet requests, while the search decider is used to determine whether or not a request should be cached. The normalized search root name is used to normalize the search root name for the cache key.

The `FacetsCacheFilter` class overrides the constructor of the `CacheFilter` class and sets up the cache filter with the appropriate cache predicate, request normalizer, post processors, and cache statistics. The cache predicate is an instance of the `FacetsQueryCachePredicate` class, which determines whether or not a request should be cached based on the search decider and normalized search root name. The request normalizer is an instance of the `FacetsCacheRequestNormalizer` class, which normalizes the request for caching purposes. The post processors are instances of the `EarlybirdCachePostProcessor` and `FacetsServicePostProcessor` classes, which process the cached response and the response from the service, respectively. Finally, the cache statistics are an instance of the `EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats` class, which provides cache statistics for the facet requests.

Overall, the `FacetsCacheFilter` class plays an important role in caching facet requests in the Earlybird search system. It ensures that facet requests are cached appropriately and efficiently, improving the performance of the search system. 

Example usage:

```java
Cache<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> cache = new FacetsCache();
SearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();
String normalizedSearchRootName = "example_search_root";
FacetsCacheFilter facetsCacheFilter = new FacetsCacheFilter(cache, decider, normalizedSearchRootName);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a cache filter for facet requests in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What other classes or modules does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and modules, including Cache, CacheFilter, SearchDecider, SearchRootModule, EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse, EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdRequestType, FacetsQueryCachePredicate, FacetsCacheRequestNormalizer, EarlybirdCachePostProcessor, and FacetsServicePostProcessor.

3. What is the significance of the "@Inject" and "@Named" annotations in this code?
- The "@Inject" annotation is used to indicate that the constructor for FacetsCacheFilter should be used for dependency injection. The "@Named" annotation is used to specify the name of the normalized search root for the cache filter.
