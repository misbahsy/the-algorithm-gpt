The `StrictRecencyCacheFilter` class is a cache filter used in the Earlybird search system at Twitter. The purpose of this filter is to cache search results for strict recency requests, which are requests that require the most recent tweets matching a query. 

The class extends the `CacheFilter` class, which is a generic class that provides caching functionality for search requests. The `StrictRecencyCacheFilter` class takes three type parameters: `EarlybirdRequestContext`, `EarlybirdRequest`, and `EarlybirdResponse`. These types represent the context, request, and response objects used in Earlybird search requests.

The constructor of the `StrictRecencyCacheFilter` class takes several parameters, including a cache object, a search decider, a normalized search root name, and a maximum number of cache results. The cache object is an instance of the `StrictRecencyCache` class, which is a cache implementation for strict recency requests. The search decider is used to determine whether a search request should be executed or not. The normalized search root name is a string that represents the root of the search hierarchy. The maximum number of cache results is an integer that specifies the maximum number of search results that can be cached.

The `StrictRecencyCacheFilter` class overrides the constructor of the `CacheFilter` class to provide additional functionality specific to strict recency requests. It creates several objects that are used to process search requests and responses, including a query cache predicate, a request normalizer, a post-processor for cache results, and a post-processor for the search service. It also creates an instance of the `EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats` class, which is used to track cache statistics for each client.

Overall, the `StrictRecencyCacheFilter` class provides caching functionality for strict recency requests in the Earlybird search system. It is used to improve the performance of search requests by caching the most recent search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a cache filter for handling requests related to earlybird strict recency.

2. What other classes or modules does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and modules, including Cache, CacheFilter, SearchDecider, SearchRootModule, EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse, EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdRequestType, and CacheCommonUtil.

3. What is the significance of the @Inject and @Named annotations in this code?
- The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that the constructor for StrictRecencyCacheFilter should be automatically injected with the specified dependencies. The @Named annotation is used to specify the name of a particular dependency that should be injected.
