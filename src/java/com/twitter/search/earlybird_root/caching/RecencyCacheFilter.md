The `RecencyCacheFilter` class is a cache filter used in the Earlybird search system at Twitter. It extends the `CacheFilter` class and is used to filter and cache search requests for recency-based queries. 

The purpose of this class is to improve the performance of the Earlybird search system by caching search results for recency-based queries. When a user makes a search request, the `RecencyCacheFilter` checks if the request matches a previously cached request. If it does, the cached response is returned instead of performing a new search. This reduces the number of requests that need to be processed and improves the response time for the user.

The `RecencyCacheFilter` takes in several parameters in its constructor. The `cache` parameter is the cache object that stores the cached search results. The `decider` parameter is a search decider object that determines whether a search request should be processed or not. The `normalizedSearchRootName` parameter is a string that represents the normalized search root name. The `maxCacheResults` parameter is an integer that represents the maximum number of cache results that can be stored.

The `RecencyCacheFilter` uses several other classes to perform its caching and filtering functions. These include the `RecencyQueryCachePredicate`, `RecencyCacheRequestNormalizer`, `RecencyAndRelevanceCachePostProcessor`, `RecencyServicePostProcessor`, and `EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats` classes.

Overall, the `RecencyCacheFilter` class plays an important role in improving the performance of the Earlybird search system by caching search results for recency-based queries. It is a key component of the caching system used in the Earlybird search system at Twitter. 

Example usage:
```java
Cache<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> cache = new RecencyCache();
SearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();
String normalizedSearchRootName = "search_root";
int maxCacheResults = 100;

RecencyCacheFilter filter = new RecencyCacheFilter(cache, decider, normalizedSearchRootName, maxCacheResults);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a cache filter for earlybird recency requests in the caching module of the project. It is used to cache search results and improve performance.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they injected?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and modules, including Cache, CacheFilter, SearchDecider, SearchRootModule, EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse, EarlybirdRequestContext, and EarlybirdRequestType. These dependencies are injected using the @Inject and @Named annotations.

3. What is the role of each of the parameters passed into the constructor?
- The parameters passed into the constructor include the cache, decider, normalizedSearchRootName, and maxCacheResults. These are used to configure the cache filter and its associated components, such as the cache predicate, request normalizer, post processors, and cache statistics.
