The `RelevanceCacheRequestNormalizer` class is a cache request normalizer that is used in the Earlybird search service at Twitter. It extends the `CacheRequestNormalizer` class and overrides its `normalizeRequest` method to provide a custom implementation for normalizing search requests before they are cached.

The purpose of this class is to determine whether a search request should be cached or not based on certain conditions. It takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns an `Optional` of `EarlybirdRequest` object. The `EarlybirdRequest` object represents a search request that is sent to the Earlybird search service.

The `RelevanceCacheRequestNormalizer` class has two instance variables: `decider` and `relevanceStripPersonalizationFieldsDeciderKey`. The `decider` variable is an instance of the `SearchDecider` class, which is used to determine whether a search request should be cached or not. The `relevanceStripPersonalizationFieldsDeciderKey` variable is a string that is used as a key to look up a specific decider in the `SearchDecider` instance.

The `normalizeRequest` method first checks whether the search request should be cached or not by calling the `isAvailable` method on the `decider` instance with the `relevanceStripPersonalizationFieldsDeciderKey` as an argument. If the method returns `true`, it means that the search request should be cached, and the `RELEVANCE_FORCE_CACHED_LOGGED_IN_REQUEST` counter is incremented. The method then calls the `normalizeRequestForCache` method on the `CacheUtil` class with the search request and a boolean value indicating whether the request should be cached or not. The method returns an `Optional` of the normalized search request.

This class is used in the Earlybird search service to normalize search requests before they are cached. It is part of a larger caching system that is used to improve the performance of the search service by reducing the number of requests that need to be processed. The `RelevanceCacheRequestNormalizer` class is responsible for determining whether a search request should be cached or not based on certain conditions. It is used in conjunction with other caching classes to provide a comprehensive caching solution for the Earlybird search service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a cache request normalizer for the Earlybird search service at Twitter, which determines whether a request should be cached based on a search decider and normalizes the request for caching using CacheUtil.

2. What is the significance of the SearchDecider and SearchCounter classes?
    
    The SearchDecider class is used to determine whether a request should be cached based on a specific decider key, while the SearchCounter class is used to increment a counter for the number of force-cached logged-in requests.

3. How does this code fit into the overall Earlybird search service architecture?
    
    This code is part of the caching module for the Earlybird search service, which is responsible for caching search requests and responses to improve performance and reduce latency. The cache request normalizer is used to determine whether a request should be cached and how it should be normalized for caching.
