The `RelevanceCacheFilter` class is a cache filter used for caching search results in the Earlybird search system at Twitter. The purpose of this class is to filter search requests and responses and cache them for future use. 

This class extends the `CacheFilter` class and takes in three generic types: `EarlybirdRequestContext`, `EarlybirdRequest`, and `EarlybirdResponse`. The `EarlybirdRequest` and `EarlybirdResponse` classes are part of the Earlybird search system and are used to represent search requests and responses, respectively. The `EarlybirdRequestContext` class is a custom class used to store additional context information about the search request.

The `RelevanceCacheFilter` class has a constructor that takes in a `Cache` object, a `SearchDecider` object, and a `String` object. The `Cache` object is used to store the cached search results. The `SearchDecider` object is used to determine whether a search request should be cached or not. The `String` object is used to store the normalized search root name.

The `RelevanceCacheFilter` class overrides the constructor of the `CacheFilter` class and calls the constructor of the superclass with six arguments. The first argument is the `Cache` object passed to the constructor of the `RelevanceCacheFilter` class. The second argument is a `RelevanceQueryCachePredicate` object, which is used to filter search requests based on their relevance. The third argument is a `RelevanceCacheRequestNormalizer` object, which is used to normalize search requests before they are cached. The fourth argument is a `RecencyAndRelevanceCachePostProcessor` object, which is used to process the cached search results. The fifth argument is a `RelevanceServicePostProcessor` object, which is used to post-process the search results before they are returned to the client. The sixth argument is an `EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats` object, which is used to store statistics about the cached search requests.

Overall, the `RelevanceCacheFilter` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system at Twitter. It is used to cache search results and improve the performance of the search system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a cache filter for handling earlybird relevance requests in the Twitter search system. It is part of the caching module of the project.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they injected?
- This code depends on several classes from the `com.twitter.search.common` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird` packages, as well as the `javax.inject` and `javax.inject.Named` packages. These dependencies are injected using the `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations in the constructor.

3. What is the role of each parameter in the constructor of `RelevanceCacheFilter`?
- The constructor takes in a cache object for storing earlybird relevance requests and responses, a search decider object for determining search relevance, and a string representing the normalized search root name. These parameters are used to configure the cache filter and its associated components, such as the cache predicate, request normalizer, and post processors.
