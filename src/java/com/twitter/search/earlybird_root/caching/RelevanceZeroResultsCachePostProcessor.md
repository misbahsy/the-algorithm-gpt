The RelevanceZeroResultsCachePostProcessor class is a cache post-processor that extends the RecencyAndRelevanceCachePostProcessor class. It overrides the postProcessCacheResponse method to implement a caching strategy for queries that return zero results. 

The purpose of this code is to improve the performance of the Earlybird search system by caching the results of queries that return zero results. When a query returns zero results, the response is cached so that subsequent identical queries can be served from the cache, rather than being processed again. This is based on the assumption that if a query returns zero results once, it will always return zero results in the future. 

The RelevanceZeroResultsCachePostProcessor class is used in the Earlybird search system to improve the efficiency of query processing. It is part of a larger caching system that includes other cache post-processors. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Earlybird search system:

```
RelevanceZeroResultsCachePostProcessor cacheProcessor = new RelevanceZeroResultsCachePostProcessor();
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest("query", "user");
EarlybirdResponse response = new EarlybirdResponse();
long sinceId = 12345;
long maxId = 67890;
Optional<EarlybirdResponse> cachedResponse = cacheProcessor.postProcessCacheResponse(request, response, sinceId, maxId);
```

In this example, a new instance of the RelevanceZeroResultsCachePostProcessor class is created. An EarlybirdRequest object is created with a query and a user. An EarlybirdResponse object is also created. The sinceId and maxId parameters are set to arbitrary values. The postProcessCacheResponse method is called with these parameters, and the result is an Optional<EarlybirdResponse> object that may or may not contain a cached response. 

Overall, the RelevanceZeroResultsCachePostProcessor class is a small but important part of the Earlybird search system that helps to improve query processing efficiency.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a cache post-processor for the Earlybird search algorithm from Twitter. It caches the response for a query that returns zero results.
2. What is the relationship between this class and the RecencyAndRelevanceCachePostProcessor class?
   - This class extends the RecencyAndRelevanceCachePostProcessor class, which means it inherits its methods and properties and can override them if needed.
3. How does the CacheCommonUtil class factor into this code?
   - The CacheCommonUtil class is used to check if the response has any results. If it does, the response is not cached.
