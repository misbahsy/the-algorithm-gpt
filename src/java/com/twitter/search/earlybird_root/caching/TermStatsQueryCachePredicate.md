The `TermStatsQueryCachePredicate` class is a part of the caching module of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. This class extends the `QueryCachePredicate` class and provides a way to determine whether a query should be cached or not based on certain conditions.

The `TermStatsQueryCachePredicate` class takes two parameters in its constructor: a `SearchDecider` object and a `normalizedSearchRootName` string. The `SearchDecider` object is used to check if the cache is enabled for the given search root, and the `normalizedSearchRootName` string is used to create a unique key for the cache.

The `shouldQueryCache` method is overridden to determine whether a query should be cached or not. It checks if the request type is `TERM_STATS`, caching is allowed for the request, and the cache is enabled for the given search root. If all these conditions are met, the method returns `true`, indicating that the query should be cached.

This class is used in the larger Earlybird search system to improve the performance of search queries by caching the results of certain queries. By using this class, the system can avoid executing the same query multiple times and instead return the cached results, which can significantly reduce the response time for the user.

Example usage:

```
SearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();
String normalizedSearchRootName = "example_search_root";
TermStatsQueryCachePredicate predicate = new TermStatsQueryCachePredicate(decider, normalizedSearchRootName);

EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();
requestContext.setEarlybirdRequestType(EarlybirdRequestType.TERM_STATS);
requestContext.setRequest(new Request());

boolean shouldCache = predicate.shouldQueryCache(requestContext);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `TermStatsQueryCachePredicate` that extends `QueryCachePredicate` and implements a method to determine whether a cache query should be performed based on the type of request, caching allowance, and availability of a cache decider.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code imports several classes from different packages, including `SearchDecider` and `EarlybirdRequestContext`, and relies on the `EarlybirdRequestUtil` class from the `EarlybirdRequestUtil` package.

3. How is the `termstatsCacheEnabledDeciderKey` value determined?
   - The `termstatsCacheEnabledDeciderKey` value is determined by concatenating the string "termstats_cache_enabled_" with the normalized search root name passed as a parameter to the constructor of the `TermStatsQueryCachePredicate` class.
