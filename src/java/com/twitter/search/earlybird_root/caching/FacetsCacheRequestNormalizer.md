The `FacetsCacheRequestNormalizer` class is a part of the caching module of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. This class extends the `CacheRequestNormalizer` class and overrides its `normalizeRequest` method. The purpose of this class is to normalize the `EarlybirdRequest` object passed in as a parameter to the `normalizeRequest` method and return an optional `EarlybirdRequest` object.

The `normalizeRequest` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object as input and returns an optional `EarlybirdRequest` object. The `EarlybirdRequestContext` object contains the `EarlybirdRequest` object and other context information. The `FacetsCacheUtil.normalizeRequestForCache` method is called with the `EarlybirdRequest` object to normalize it for caching. The `normalizeRequestForCache` method is a static method of the `FacetsCacheUtil` class, which is a part of the `common.caching` package of the Earlybird search system. This method normalizes the `EarlybirdRequest` object by removing any non-cacheable parameters and sorting the remaining parameters in a canonical order. The normalized `EarlybirdRequest` object is then returned as an optional object.

The `FacetsCacheRequestNormalizer` class is used in the caching module of the Earlybird search system to normalize the `EarlybirdRequest` object before caching it. The normalized `EarlybirdRequest` object is then used as a key to cache the search results. This helps to reduce the number of cache misses and improve the performance of the search system.

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(request);
FacetsCacheRequestNormalizer requestNormalizer = new FacetsCacheRequestNormalizer();
Optional<EarlybirdRequest> normalizedRequest = requestNormalizer.normalizeRequest(requestContext);
if (normalizedRequest.isPresent()) {
  // Cache the search results using the normalized request as a key
} else {
  // Do not cache the search results
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a cache request normalizer for the Earlybird search algorithm from Twitter, specifically for normalizing requests related to facets caching.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on the Google Guava library and the FacetsCacheUtil and CacheRequestNormalizer classes from the Twitter Search Common library.

3. How does this code fit into the overall Earlybird search algorithm?
   - This code is a small component of the Earlybird search algorithm that helps to optimize caching of search results by normalizing requests related to facets caching.
