The `EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats` class is responsible for recording cache statistics for each client in the Earlybird search system. It extends the `PerClientCacheStats` class and overrides two of its methods: `recordRequest` and `recordCacheHit`. 

The constructor takes a `cacheRequestType` parameter, which is used to format the cache statistics strings. Two maps are initialized to store the cache statistics for each client: `cacheTurnedOffByClient` and `cacheHitsByClient`. 

The `recordRequest` method is called when a search request is made. It checks if caching is allowed for the request using the `EarlybirdRequestUtil.isCachingAllowed` method. If caching is not allowed, it retrieves the client ID from the request context and increments the `SearchRateCounter` associated with that client in the `cacheTurnedOffByClient` map. If the counter does not exist for the client, it is created using `computeIfAbsent`.

The `recordCacheHit` method is called when a cache hit occurs for a search request. It retrieves the client ID from the request context and increments the `SearchRateCounter` associated with that client in the `cacheHitsByClient` map. If the counter does not exist for the client, it is created using `computeIfAbsent`.

These cache statistics can be used to monitor the cache usage for each client in the Earlybird search system. For example, the number of cache hits and misses can be used to optimize the cache size and eviction policies. The cache off statistics can be used to identify clients that are not benefiting from caching and may need to be investigated further. 

Example usage:
```
EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats cacheStats = new EarlybirdRequestPerClientCacheStats("search");
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(request);
cacheStats.recordRequest(requestContext);
cacheStats.recordCacheHit(requestContext);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a Java class that extends a parent class called `PerClientCacheStats` and provides methods to record cache hits and cache misses for a specific type of cache request (`cacheRequestType`), based on the client ID of the request.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
    
    This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `java.util.Map`, `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`, `com.twitter.search.common.caching.filter.PerClientCacheStats`, `com.twitter.search.common.metrics.SearchRateCounter`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird.common.EarlybirdRequestUtil`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.common.EarlybirdRequestContext`.

3. What data is being stored in the `cacheTurnedOffByClient` and `cacheHitsByClient` maps?
    
    The `cacheTurnedOffByClient` map stores a `SearchRateCounter` object for each client ID that has turned off caching for the specified cache request type. The `cacheHitsByClient` map stores a `SearchRateCounter` object for each client ID that has had a cache hit for the specified cache request type. The `SearchRateCounter` objects are used to keep track of the number of cache hits and misses for each client ID.
