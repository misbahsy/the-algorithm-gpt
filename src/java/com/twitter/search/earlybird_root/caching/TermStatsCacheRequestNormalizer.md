The `TermStatsCacheRequestNormalizer` class is a part of the caching module of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. This class extends the `CacheRequestNormalizer` class and overrides its `normalizeRequest` method. The purpose of this class is to normalize the `EarlybirdRequest` object passed in as a parameter to the `normalizeRequest` method and return an optional `EarlybirdRequest` object.

The `normalizeRequest` method calls the `normalizeForCache` method of the `TermStatsCacheUtil` class, which is a utility class for normalizing search requests for caching. The `normalizeForCache` method takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and returns a normalized version of the same object. The `normalizeForCache` method is called using the `requestContext.getRequest()` method, which returns the `EarlybirdRequest` object passed in as a parameter to the `normalizeRequest` method.

The `normalizeRequest` method returns an optional `EarlybirdRequest` object using the `Optional.fromNullable` method. The `Optional` class is a part of the Google Guava library and is used to represent a nullable object. The `fromNullable` method returns an `Optional` object containing the specified value if it is not null, otherwise it returns an empty `Optional` object.

This class is used in the Earlybird search system to normalize search requests for caching. The normalized requests are then stored in a cache for faster retrieval in the future. The `TermStatsCacheRequestNormalizer` class is a part of a larger caching module that is used to improve the performance of the Earlybird search system. 

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();
// set request parameters
TermStatsCacheRequestNormalizer normalizer = new TermStatsCacheRequestNormalizer();
Optional<EarlybirdRequest> normalizedRequest = normalizer.normalizeRequest(requestContext);
if (normalizedRequest.isPresent()) {
  // use normalized request for caching
} else {
  // handle null request
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a cache request normalizer for the Earlybird search algorithm from Twitter, specifically for normalizing term statistics cache requests.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the Google Guava library and the TermStatsCacheUtil and CacheRequestNormalizer classes from the Twitter search common caching package.
3. What is the expected input and output of the normalizeRequest method?
   - The normalizeRequest method takes an EarlybirdRequestContext object as input and returns an Optional of EarlybirdRequest. It normalizes the request using the TermStatsCacheUtil class and returns an Optional containing the normalized request.
