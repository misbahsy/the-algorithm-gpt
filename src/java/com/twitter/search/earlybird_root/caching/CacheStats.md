The `CacheStats` class is responsible for tracking and reporting statistics related to caching in the larger project. It is a part of the `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.caching` package and imports the `SearchRateCounter` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.metrics` package.

The class defines two static final variables, `REQUEST_FAILED_COUNTER` and `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_COUNTER`, both of which are instances of the `SearchRateCounter` class. These variables are used to keep track of the number of failed and timed-out requests made to the caching system.

The `SearchRateCounter` class is a utility class that provides a way to track and report rates of events. It is used to measure the rate at which requests to the caching system are failing or timing out. The `export` method of the `SearchRateCounter` class is used to create and export a new instance of the class with a given name.

The `CacheStats` class has a private constructor, which means that it cannot be instantiated from outside the class. This is because the class only contains static variables and does not need to be instantiated.

Overall, the `CacheStats` class plays an important role in the larger project by providing a way to monitor the performance of the caching system. Developers can use the statistics collected by this class to identify and fix issues related to caching. Here is an example of how the `REQUEST_FAILED_COUNTER` variable can be used to track the number of failed requests:

```
try {
  // make a request to the caching system
} catch (Exception e) {
  // increment the failed request counter
  CacheStats.REQUEST_FAILED_COUNTER.increment();
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `CacheStats` that contains two static `SearchRateCounter` objects for tracking failed and timed out requests to a memcache.

2. What is the significance of the `SearchRateCounter` class?
   - The `SearchRateCounter` class is likely a custom class used for tracking metrics related to search functionality in the Twitter application.

3. Why is the constructor for `CacheStats` private?
   - The private constructor for `CacheStats` prevents instances of the class from being created, indicating that it is meant to be used only for its static fields.
