The `CacheCommonUtil` class in the `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.caching` package provides a utility method for checking if an `EarlybirdResponse` object has search results. This class is likely used in the caching functionality of the larger project to determine if a response should be cached or not.

The `hasResults` method takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object as a parameter and returns a boolean value. It first checks if the `SearchResults` field of the response is set and not null. If it is, it then checks if the list of results is not empty. If both conditions are true, the method returns `true`, indicating that the response has search results. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here is an example of how this method could be used in the larger project:

```java
EarlybirdResponse response = // get response from API
if (CacheCommonUtil.hasResults(response)) {
  // cache the response
} else {
  // do not cache the response
}
```

In this example, the `hasResults` method is used to determine if the response should be cached or not. If the response has search results, it is cached. Otherwise, it is not cached. This helps to optimize the caching functionality by only caching responses that actually contain search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a utility class for caching in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What is the significance of the "NAMED_MAX_CACHE_RESULTS" constant?
   - The "NAMED_MAX_CACHE_RESULTS" constant is used to specify the maximum number of cache results that can be stored.

3. What does the "hasResults" method do?
   - The "hasResults" method checks if the EarlybirdResponse object has search results and if the results are not empty. It returns a boolean value indicating whether there are results or not.
