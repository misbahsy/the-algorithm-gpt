The `TopTweetsServicePostProcessor` class is a part of the caching module of the Earlybird search service from Twitter. It extends the `ServicePostProcessor` class and overrides its `processServiceResponse` method to cache the response of a search query for top tweets. 

The class has two constants, `CACHE_AGE_IN_MS` and `NO_RESULT_CACHE_AGE_IN_MS`, which define the time duration for which the cache should be valid. The `cache` field is an instance of the `Cache` interface, which is used to store the search results in memory.

The `processServiceResponse` method takes two arguments, `requestContext` and `serviceResponse`, which represent the search query and its response, respectively. It first extracts the original search request from the `requestContext` object. Then, it logs a debug message indicating that it is writing the search results to the cache. Finally, it calls the `cacheResults` method of the `TopTweetsCacheUtil` class to store the search results in the cache.

The `cacheResults` method takes five arguments: the original search request, the search response, the cache instance, and the two cache age constants. It first checks if the search response is null or empty. If it is, it stores a special value in the cache to indicate that there were no results for the search query. Otherwise, it stores the search response in the cache with the specified cache age.

This class is used in the Earlybird search service to cache the results of top tweets queries. The cached results can be used to serve subsequent requests for the same query without having to execute the search again. This improves the performance of the search service by reducing the response time for frequently executed queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a service post-processor for caching top tweets in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
    
    This code relies on the SLF4J logging framework and the Guava library's `checkNotNull` method.

3. What is the caching strategy used in this code?
    
    This code uses a cache with a maximum age of 10 minutes for successful requests and 5 minutes for requests with no results. The cache is populated with the original request and its corresponding response using the `cacheResults` method from `TopTweetsCacheUtil`.
