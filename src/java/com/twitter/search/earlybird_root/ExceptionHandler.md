The code above defines a class called `ExceptionHandler` that provides a method for logging exceptions that occur during the handling of a `EarlybirdRequest`. The `EarlybirdRequest` is an object that is defined in another package of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. 

The `ExceptionHandler` class has a single public method called `logException` that takes two arguments: an instance of `EarlybirdRequest` and a `Throwable` object that represents the exception that was thrown. The method logs the exception using the `SLF4J` logging framework at the `ERROR` level. The log message includes the `EarlybirdRequest` object and the exception that was thrown.

The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for handling exceptions that occur during the processing of `EarlybirdRequest` objects. By using this class, developers can ensure that all exceptions are logged in a consistent manner, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues that may arise during the processing of requests.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```java
try {
  // code that handles EarlybirdRequest objects
} catch (Exception e) {
  ExceptionHandler.logException(request, e);
}
```

In this example, the `logException` method is called if an exception is thrown during the processing of an `EarlybirdRequest`. This ensures that the exception is logged in a consistent manner, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues that may arise during the processing of requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called ExceptionHandler that logs exceptions that occur while handling EarlybirdRequest objects in the Twitter search application.

2. What is the significance of the EarlybirdRequest class?
   The EarlybirdRequest class is a Thrift-generated class that represents a request to the Twitter search application.

3. Why is the ExceptionHandler constructor private?
   The ExceptionHandler constructor is private to prevent instantiation of the class, as it only contains static methods for logging exceptions.
