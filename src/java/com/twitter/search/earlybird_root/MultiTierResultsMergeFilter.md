The `MultiTierResultsMergeFilter` is a Java class that serves as a filter for merging results from multiple tiers. It is part of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. The purpose of this filter is to take in a list of `EarlybirdResponse` objects, which are the results of a search query, and merge them into a single response. 

The class extends the `Filter` class from the `com.twitter.finagle` package, which is a library for building network services. It takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and a list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects, and returns a `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` object. The `EarlybirdRequestContext` object contains information about the search query, such as the query string and the search parameters. The `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects represent the results of the search query from each tier.

The `MultiTierResultsMergeFilter` class has a constructor that takes in an `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` object. This object is used to merge the feature schemas of the search results. The `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` is a class that is responsible for merging the feature schemas of the search results from different tiers. 

The `apply` method of the `MultiTierResultsMergeFilter` class takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and a `Service` object that takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns a list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects. The `apply` method calls the `service` object with the `request` object and then calls the `merge` method with the `request` object and the list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects returned by the `service` object.

The `merge` method takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and a list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects. It creates an `EarlybirdResponseMerger` object, which is responsible for merging the search results from different tiers. The `EarlybirdResponseMerger` object takes in the `EarlybirdRequestContext` object, the list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects, an `EarlybirdCluster` object, an `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` object, and an integer value. The `EarlybirdCluster` object represents the cluster of servers that the search query was sent to. The integer value is used for stats counting purposes. The `merge` method calls the `merge` method of the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` object and returns the result.

Overall, the `MultiTierResultsMergeFilter` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. It is used to merge the search results from different tiers into a single response. The class takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and a list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects, and returns a `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` object. The `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` object is used to merge the feature schemas of the search results. The `EarlybirdResponseMerger` object is responsible for merging the search results from different tiers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a filter that is used to merge results from multiple tiers in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
   
   This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `EarlybirdCluster`, `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger`, `EarlybirdRequestContext`, `EarlybirdResponse`, `EarlybirdResponseMerger`, `Filter`, `Function`, `List`, `Service`, and `TierResponseAccumulator`.

3. How does the merging of results work in this code?
   
   The merging of results is done by creating an instance of `EarlybirdResponseMerger` and passing it the `EarlybirdRequestContext`, a list of `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` objects, an instance of `TierResponseAccumulator`, the `EarlybirdCluster.FULL_ARCHIVE` constant, the `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger`, and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The `merge()` method of the `EarlybirdResponseMerger` is then called to perform the actual merging of the results.
