The `EarlybirdWarmup` class is responsible for warming up the Earlybird Roots service. This is done by sending a series of requests to the service with a 1 second timeout between each round. The number of requests sent by each round can be configured.

The `EarlybirdWarmup` class extends the `SearchRootWarmup` class, which provides a framework for warming up search services. The `SearchRootWarmup` class takes care of the timing and logging of the warm-up process, and provides two abstract methods that must be implemented by the subclass: `createRequest` and `callService`.

The `createRequest` method is responsible for creating a request to be sent to the service. In this case, the method creates an `EarlybirdRequest` object with a search query that includes the string "warmup" and a unique request ID. The `EarlybirdRequest` object also includes parameters for the number of results to return, the ranking mode, and the relevance options.

The `callService` method is responsible for calling the service with the request created by `createRequest`. In this case, the method uses the `ClientId` class to set the client ID for the request, and then calls the `search` method on the `EarlybirdService` object with the request.

Overall, the `EarlybirdWarmup` class is an important part of the Earlybird Roots service, as it ensures that the service is warmed up and ready to handle search requests. Here is an example of how the `EarlybirdWarmup` class might be used in the larger project:

```java
Clock clock = new SystemClock();
WarmupConfig config = new WarmupConfig(60, 100);
EarlybirdWarmup warmup = new EarlybirdWarmup(clock, config);
warmup.run();
```

This code creates a `Clock` object using the `SystemClock` class, which provides the current time in milliseconds. It then creates a `WarmupConfig` object with 60 rounds of requests and a 100 millisecond timeout between each round. Finally, it creates an `EarlybirdWarmup` object with the `Clock` and `WarmupConfig` objects, and calls the `run` method to start the warm-up process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is the warm-up logic for Earlybird Roots, which sends rounds of requests to the Earlybird service with a 1 second timeout between each round.

2. What are the parameters used to configure the requests sent in the warm-up?
- The requests sent in the warm-up are configured with a number of results to return, a ranking mode, a relevance option, and a serialized query.

3. What is the role of the `callService` method?
- The `callService` method calls the Earlybird service with the given request and returns a `Future` of the response. It also sets the current client ID to "earlybird_root_warmup" using the `ClientId` class.
