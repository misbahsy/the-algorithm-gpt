The `DropAllProtectedOperatorFilter` class is a filter that drops all protected operators from a search query. It is a part of the Earlybird search system from Twitter and is used to preprocess search queries before they are sent to the search engine.

The filter is implemented as a Finagle `SimpleFilter` that takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` and an `EarlybirdResponse` as input and output, respectively. The `EarlybirdRequestContext` contains the search query as a `Query` object, which is parsed by the `QueryParser` library. The filter applies a `DropAllProtectedOperatorVisitor` to the query object to remove all protected operators from it. If the query object is not modified by the visitor, the filter passes the request to the next filter in the chain. If the query object is modified, the filter creates a new `EarlybirdRequestContext` with the modified query and passes it to the next filter.

The purpose of the filter is to prevent users from using protected operators in their search queries. Protected operators are operators that are reserved for internal use by the search system and are not meant to be used by users. By dropping all protected operators from the query, the filter ensures that the search system only receives valid queries that do not contain any protected operators.

Here is an example of how the filter can be used in the Earlybird search system:

```java
DropAllProtectedOperatorFilter filter = new DropAllProtectedOperatorFilter(new DropAllProtectedOperatorVisitor());
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> searchService = new SearchService();
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> filteredService = filter.andThen(searchService);
```

In this example, the `DropAllProtectedOperatorFilter` is created with a new instance of the `DropAllProtectedOperatorVisitor`. The filter is then combined with a `SearchService` using the `andThen` method to create a new filtered service that can be used to process search requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a filter called `DropAllProtectedOperatorFilter` that removes protected operators from a search query.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including `javax.inject`, `com.google.common`, `org.slf4j`, `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.search.common`, and `com.twitter.search.queryparser`.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
- This code tracks three metrics using `SearchCounter`: `protected_operator_filter_query_parser_failure_count`, `drop_all_protected_operator_filter_total`, and `drop_all_protected_operator_filter_operator_dropped`.
