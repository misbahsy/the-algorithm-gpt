The `NamedMultiTermDisjunctionStatsFilter` class is a filter that records statistics on the size of named multi-term disjunctions in search queries. It extends the `SimpleFilter` class and overrides its `apply` method to implement the filter logic. The filter takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and a `Service` object as input and returns a `Future` of `EarlybirdResponse`.

The filter first checks if the search query in the request has a named disjunction map set. If it does, the filter iterates over the entries in the map and records the size of each disjunction in a `ConcurrentMap` of percentiles. The percentiles are stored in a nested map that maps client IDs to disjunction names to percentiles. The percentiles are created using the `PercentileUtil.createPercentile` method, which takes a string format and returns a `Percentile` object. The string format is used to generate a unique name for the percentile based on the client ID and disjunction name.

The filter then passes the request to the next service in the chain by calling the `apply` method on the input service object.

This filter is likely used in a larger search system to collect statistics on the size of named multi-term disjunctions in search queries. The statistics can be used to monitor the performance of the system and identify any issues related to large disjunctions. The percentiles can be exposed through a monitoring system and used to generate alerts or dashboards. For example, the following code snippet shows how the percentiles can be retrieved and logged:

```
ConcurrentMap<String, Percentile<Integer>> statsForClient =
    NAMED_MULTI_TERM_DISJUNCTION_IDS_COUNT.get(clientId);
if (statsForClient != null) {
    for (Map.Entry<String, Percentile<Integer>> entry : statsForClient.entrySet()) {
        Percentile<Integer> percentile = entry.getValue();
        log.info("Client {} disjunction {} size percentile: {}", clientId, entry.getKey(),
            percentile.getPercentile(0.5));
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a filter for an Earlybird search service that records statistics on the size of named disjunctions in search queries.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the Finagle library for building network services and the PercentileUtil library for recording percentile statistics.

3. How are the statistics recorded and stored?
- The statistics are stored in a ConcurrentHashMap that maps client IDs to disjunction names to Percentile objects. The size of each named disjunction encountered in a search query is recorded using the Percentile.record() method.
