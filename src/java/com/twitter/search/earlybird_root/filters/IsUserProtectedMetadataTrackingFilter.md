The IsUserProtectedMetadataTrackingFilter class is a filter that tracks metadata stats returned from Earlybirds. It extends the SimpleFilter class and takes in an EarlybirdRequestContext and EarlybirdResponse as input. The purpose of this filter is to count the number of search results that have the isUserProtected metadata set to true and the total number of search results returned. 

The filter contains two maps, totalCounterByRequestTypeMap and isProtectedCounterByRequestTypeMap, which are used to store the total count and isUserProtected count for each EarlybirdRequestType. These maps are populated in the constructor of the class using a for loop that iterates over all the values of the EarlybirdRequestType enum. 

The apply method of the filter takes in an EarlybirdRequestContext and Service as input and returns a Future<EarlybirdResponse>. It first calls the apply method of the Service to get the response. It then adds a FutureEventListener to the response to track the metadata stats. 

The onSuccess method of the FutureEventListener is called when the response is successful. It first checks if the response has any search results. If there are no search results, it returns. Otherwise, it iterates over all the search results and checks if the isUserProtected metadata is set to true. If it is, it increments the isUserProtectedCount. It then increments the totalCount and updates the totalCounterByRequestTypeMap and isProtectedCounterByRequestTypeMap with the new counts. 

The onFailure method of the FutureEventListener is called when the response fails. It does nothing in this implementation. 

Overall, this filter is used to track the isUserProtected metadata stats returned from Earlybirds. It can be used in the larger project to monitor the number of search results that have the isUserProtected metadata set to true and the total number of search results returned. This information can be used to improve the search algorithm and provide better search results to users. 

Example usage:

IsUserProtectedMetadataTrackingFilter filter = new IsUserProtectedMetadataTrackingFilter();
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> service = ... // create service
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> filteredService = filter.andThen(service); // apply filter to service
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = filteredService.apply(request); // get response with filter applied
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a filter that tracks the isUserProtected metadata stats returned from Earlybirds, and applies it to EarlybirdRequestContext and EarlybirdResponse objects.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including Google Guava, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Util.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this filter?
- This filter tracks two metrics: the total number of search results and the number of search results where the isUserProtected metadata is true, both broken down by EarlybirdRequestType.
