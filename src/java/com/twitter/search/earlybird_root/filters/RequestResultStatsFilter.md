The `RequestResultStatsFilter` class is a filter that is used to collect statistics about the requests and responses of a search query. The purpose of this filter is to provide insight into the performance of the search system and to help identify areas for improvement.

The `RequestResultStatsFilter` class extends the `SimpleFilter` class, which is a Finagle filter that takes a request and returns a response. The `RequestResultStatsFilter` class takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object. The `RequestResultStatsFilter` class is injected with a `Clock` object and a `RequestResultStats` object.

The `RequestResultStats` class is a static inner class that contains the statistics that are collected by the filter. The statistics are stored in `SearchCounter` and `Percentile` objects. The `SearchCounter` class is a simple counter that is used to count the number of times a particular event occurs. The `Percentile` class is used to calculate the percentile of a set of values.

The `RequestResultStatsFilter` class has two methods that are used to update the statistics. The `updateRequestStats` method is called when a request is received. This method extracts the relevant information from the request and updates the appropriate counters and percentiles. The `updateResultsStats` method is called when a response is received. This method extracts the relevant information from the response and updates the appropriate counters and percentiles.

The `apply` method is the main method of the `RequestResultStatsFilter` class. This method takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and a `Service` object as input. The `Service` object is used to process the request and return a response. The `apply` method calls the `updateRequestStats` method to update the request statistics. It then calls the `Service` object to process the request and return a response. Finally, it calls the `updateResultsStats` method to update the response statistics.

The `RequestResultStatsFilter` class is used in the larger project to collect statistics about the search system. These statistics can be used to identify areas for improvement and to monitor the performance of the system over time. The statistics can also be used to compare the performance of different versions of the search system. For example, if a new version of the search system is released, the statistics can be used to compare the performance of the new version to the performance of the old version.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a filter for an Earlybird search service that updates and exports various search metrics.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Twitter's Finagle and SnowflakeId, as well as Scala's runtime library.

3. What metrics are being tracked and exported by this code?
- This code tracks and exports several search metrics including the number of results requested and returned, the maximum number of hits to process, the number of hits and documents processed, and various percentiles of requested and returned results and oldest result age.
