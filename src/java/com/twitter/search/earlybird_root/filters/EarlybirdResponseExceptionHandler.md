The `EarlybirdResponseExceptionHandler` class is a filter that handles exceptions that may occur during the processing of an `EarlybirdRequest`. It converts exceptions into `EarlybirdResponses` with error codes that can be understood by the client. 

The class has three maps that store `SearchCounter` objects for different types of exceptions: `requestTypeToCancelledExceptions`, `requestTypeToTimeoutExceptions`, and `requestTypeToPersistentErrors`. These maps are used to keep track of the number of exceptions that occur for each type of request. There are also three `SearchCounter` objects that keep track of the total number of exceptions: `cancelledExceptions`, `timeoutExceptions`, and `persistentErrors`.

The constructor takes a `statPrefix` parameter that is used to create the names of the `SearchCounter` objects. The `handleException` method takes an `EarlybirdRequest` and a `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` as parameters. If the `Future` wraps an exception, the method converts it to an `EarlybirdResponse` instance with an appropriate error code. 

If the exception is a `ClientErrorException`, the method sets the response code to `EarlybirdResponseCode.CLIENT_ERROR` and sets the debug string to the exception message. If the exception is a `CancelException`, the method increments the appropriate `SearchCounter` objects and sets the response code to `EarlybirdResponseCode.CLIENT_CANCEL_ERROR`. If the exception is a `TimeoutException`, the method increments the appropriate `SearchCounter` objects and sets the response code to `EarlybirdResponseCode.SERVER_TIMEOUT_ERROR`. If the exception is unexpected, the method logs the exception and sets the response code to `EarlybirdResponseCode.PERSISTENT_ERROR`.

This class is used in the larger project to ensure that clients receive meaningful error messages when exceptions occur during the processing of `EarlybirdRequests`. It is part of a larger system that handles search requests for Twitter. 

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdResponseExceptionHandler handler = new EarlybirdResponseExceptionHandler("myStatPrefix");
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();
Future<EarlybirdResponse> responseFuture = Future.exception(new Exception("Something went wrong"));
Future<EarlybirdResponse> handledFuture = handler.handleException(request, responseFuture);
handledFuture.onSuccess(response -> System.out.println(response.getResponseCode()));
// Output: PERSISTENT_ERROR
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a filter for handling exceptions in the Earlybird search service from Twitter.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on the SLF4J logging framework, the FinagleUtil utility class, and the EarlybirdRequest and EarlybirdResponse classes from the Earlybird search service.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
- This code tracks the number of cancelled exceptions, timeout exceptions, and persistent errors, as well as the number of each type of exception for each type of Earlybird request. These metrics are exported using the SearchCounter class.
