The `DisableClientByTierFilter` class is a filter that checks if a client is blocked based on their tier value. It extends the `SimpleFilter` class and overrides its `apply` method. The `apply` method takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and a `Service` object as input parameters and returns a `Future` object of type `EarlybirdResponse`. 

The `DisableClientByTierFilter` class has two instance variables: `decider` and `quotaManager`. The `decider` variable is of type `SearchDecider` and is used to check if a client is available. The `quotaManager` variable is of type `ClientIdQuotaManager` and is used to get the quota information for a client.

The `apply` method first gets the client ID from the `EarlybirdRequest` object using the `getClientIdFromRequest` method of the `ClientIdUtil` class. It then gets the quota information for the client using the `getQuotaForClient` method of the `ClientIdQuotaManager` class. If the quota information is not available, it gets the common pool quota using the `getCommonPoolQuota` method of the `ClientIdQuotaManager` class. It then gets the client's tier value from the quota information and checks if the client is available using the `isAvailable` method of the `SearchDecider` class. If the client is not available, it returns a `Future` object of type `EarlybirdResponse` with an error code and a debug string. Otherwise, it applies the `Service` object to the `EarlybirdRequest` object and returns the result.

The `getClientBlockedResponse` method is a private method that takes a client ID and a tier value as input parameters and returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object with an error code, an empty list of search results, and a debug string that explains why the client is blocked.

This filter is used to block clients based on their tier value. It is injected with a `ClientIdQuotaManager` object and a `SearchDecider` object. It is used in the larger project to ensure that clients are not blocked due to their tier value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a filter called `DisableClientByTierFilter` that is used in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project to block requests from clients based on their tier. It is used to enforce quotas and prevent overuse of resources.

2. What dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several dependencies, including `com.google.common`, `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.search.common.decider`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.quota`. 

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- This code takes in an `EarlybirdRequest` object and returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object. The filter checks the client's tier and blocks the request if the tier is not allowed to access the resource. If the tier is allowed, the request is passed on to the next filter in the chain.
