The `RejectRequestsByQuerySourceFilter` class is a filter that rejects requests based on the query source of the request. It is intended to be used at the super-root or archive-root level. If used to reject a client request at the super-root level, the client will get a response with empty results and a REQUEST_BLOCKED_ERROR status code. If used at the archive-root level, the client will get a response that might contain some results from real-time and protected sources, and the status code of the response will depend on how the super-root combines responses from the three downstream roots.

The class extends the `SimpleFilter` class, which is a Finagle filter that takes a request of type `EarlybirdRequest` and returns a response of type `EarlybirdResponse`. The `apply` method of the filter takes a request and a service, and returns a future response. The method first checks the query source of the request, and then checks if the search decider is available for that query source. If the search decider is available, the method increments the rejected requests counter for that query source and returns a rejected request response. If the search decider is not available, the method applies the request to the service and returns the response.

The class has two maps: `rejectedRequestsCounterPerQuerySource` and `rejectRequestsDeciderKeyPerQuerySource`. The `rejectedRequestsCounterPerQuerySource` map maps each query source to a search rate counter that counts the number of rejected requests for that query source. The `rejectRequestsDeciderKeyPerQuerySource` map maps each query source to a decider key that is used to check if the search decider is available for that query source.

The class has a constructor that takes an `EarlybirdCluster` and a `SearchDecider`. The `EarlybirdCluster` is used to get the name of the cluster for stats. The `SearchDecider` is used to check if the search decider is available for a query source.

Here is an example of how to use the `RejectRequestsByQuerySourceFilter` class:

```java
RejectRequestsByQuerySourceFilter filter = new RejectRequestsByQuerySourceFilter(cluster, searchDecider);
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> service = new MyService();
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> filteredService = filter.andThen(service);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it intended to be used?
   - This code is a filter that rejects requests based on the query source of the request. It is intended to be used at super-root or archive-root.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has external dependencies on several libraries including `javax.annotation`, `com.google.common`, `com.twitter.finagle`, and `com.twitter.util`.
3. What metrics are being tracked by this code and how are they used?
   - This code tracks the number of rejected requests per query source and exports them using `SearchRateCounter`. These metrics are used to monitor the number of rejected requests and can be used to identify potential issues with query sources.
