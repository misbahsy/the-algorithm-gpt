The `MarkTweetSourceFilter` class is a filter that is used in the Earlybird search service of Twitter. The purpose of this filter is to mark the tweet source of search results returned by the service. The tweet source is a field that indicates the source of the tweet, such as Twitter for iPhone or Twitter Web Client. 

The filter takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and an `EarlybirdResponse` object and returns a modified `EarlybirdResponse` object. The `ThriftTweetSource` object is passed to the constructor of the filter and is used to mark the tweet source of the search results. 

The `apply` method of the filter takes in the `requestContext` and `service` objects and returns a `Future` object that contains the modified `EarlybirdResponse`. The `map` method is used to modify the `EarlybirdResponse` object. If the response code is `SUCCESS` and the request type is not `TERM_STATS`, the filter checks if the search results are set. If the search results are not set, the `searchResultsNotSet` counter is incremented. If the search results are set, the tweet source of each search result is marked with the `ThriftTweetSource` object passed to the constructor. 

This filter is used in the Earlybird search service to mark the tweet source of search results. The tweet source is an important field that can be used to analyze the behavior of Twitter users on different platforms. The filter can be used in conjunction with other filters to modify the search results returned by the Earlybird search service. 

Example usage:

```
ThriftTweetSource tweetSource = new ThriftTweetSource("Twitter for iPhone");
MarkTweetSourceFilter markTweetSourceFilter = new MarkTweetSourceFilter(tweetSource);
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> service = ... // create Earlybird search service
service = markTweetSourceFilter.andThen(service); // add filter to service
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = ... // create search request context
Future<EarlybirdResponse> responseFuture = service.apply(requestContext); // get search results
```
