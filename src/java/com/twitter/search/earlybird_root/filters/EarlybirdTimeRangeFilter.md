The EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter is a Finagle filter used to filter requests to tiers. It parses the serialized query on Earlybird request and extracts since/until/since_id/max_id operators. This filter then tests whether the request overlaps with the given tier. If there is no overlap, an empty response is returned without actually forwarding the requests to the underlying service. 

The filter is constructed with a ServingRangeProvider that holds the boundary information. It has two constructors, one with an optional EarlybirdTimeFilterQueryRewriter and one without. The EarlybirdTimeFilterQueryRewriter is used to rewrite the request context if it is present. 

The apply() method is the main method of the filter. It takes an EarlybirdRequestContext and a Service and returns a Future of EarlybirdResponse. If the parsed query is null, the filter passes the request through like an identity filter. If the parsed query is not null, the filter tries to get the IdTimeRanges from the query. If there are no time ranges in the query, the filter issues the service request. If there are time ranges in the query, the filter gets the serving range from the ServingRangeProvider and checks if the query overlaps with the serving range. If the query does not overlap with the serving range, the filter returns a tier skipped response. If the query overlaps with the serving range, the filter issues the service request. 

The tierSkippedResponse() method creates a tier skipped response based on the given request type. For recency, relevance, facets, and top tweets requests, this method returns a SUCCESS response with no search results and the minSearchedStatusID and maxSearchedStatusID appropriately set. For term stats response, it returns a TIER_SKIPPED response. 

Overall, the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter is an important filter in the Earlybird project as it helps to optimize the search process by filtering out requests that do not overlap with the serving range of the tier.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a Finagle filter used to filter requests to tiers based on their time range. It parses serialized queries on Earlybird requests and extracts since/until/since_id/max_id operators to test whether the request overlaps with the given tier. If there is no overlap, an empty response is returned without forwarding the request to the underlying service. This code is part of the Earlybird project and is used to optimize search queries.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries, including Google Guava, SLF4J, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Search Common. It also uses several classes and interfaces from the Earlybird project, such as EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdRequestType, and ServingRange.

3. What is the purpose of the `queryRewriter` field and how is it used?
- The `queryRewriter` field is an optional instance of the EarlybirdTimeFilterQueryRewriter class, which is used to rewrite Earlybird requests by adding time filter operators. If the `queryRewriter` field is present, the apply() method calls its rewriteRequest() method to modify the request before forwarding it to the underlying service. If the `queryRewriter` field is empty, the apply() method simply passes the request along to the service.
