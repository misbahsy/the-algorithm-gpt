The `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaAnnotateFilter` class is a filter that annotates an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object with information about available feature schemas before sending it to the Earlybird search service. This filter is part of the Earlybird search system used by Twitter.

The purpose of this filter is to provide the Earlybird search service with information about the available feature schemas for a given search query. Feature schemas are used to define the set of features that are extracted from a search query and returned in the search results. By annotating the request context with information about the available feature schemas, the Earlybird search service can optimize its feature extraction process and return more relevant search results.

The `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaAnnotateFilter` class extends the `SimpleFilter` class from the Finagle library, which is a library for building high-performance network services in Scala. The `apply` method of this filter takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and a `Service` object that represents the Earlybird search service. It then calls the `annotateRequestContext` method to annotate the request context with information about the available feature schemas and returns the result of calling the `apply` method on the service object.

The `annotateRequestContext` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns a new `EarlybirdRequestContext` object that has been annotated with information about the available feature schemas. This method checks if the search query in the request context has the `ReturnSearchResultFeatures` option set to true, which indicates that the search results should include feature schemas. If this option is set, the method retrieves the available feature schemas from the request context and the current root, and sets them in the new request context. If the option is not set, the method returns the original request context unchanged.

Overall, the `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaAnnotateFilter` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system used by Twitter. It helps to optimize the feature extraction process and improve the relevance of search results by providing the Earlybird search service with information about the available feature schemas for a given search query.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a filter for the Earlybird search service from Twitter that annotates the request to indicate the available feature schemas before sending it to Earlybird.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several Twitter libraries, including Finagle and ThriftSearchFeatureSchemaSpecifier.

3. What is the role of the EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger class?
- The EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger class is injected into the EarlybirdFeatureSchemaAnnotateFilter and is used to get the available feature schemas based on what is cached in the current root.
