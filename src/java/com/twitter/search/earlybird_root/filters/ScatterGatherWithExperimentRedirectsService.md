The `ScatterGatherWithExperimentRedirectsService` class is a service that redirects requests to different scatter-gather services based on an experiment cluster. It extends the `Service` class and takes in two parameters in its constructor: a control scatter-gather service and a map of experiment scatter-gather services. 

The `apply` method is overridden to handle incoming requests. If the request contains an experiment cluster to use, the method checks if the experiment scatter-gather services map contains the specified cluster. If it does, the method applies the request to the corresponding scatter-gather service. If it does not, the method logs an error and returns a client error response. If the request does not contain an experiment cluster to use, the method applies the request to the control scatter-gather service.

This class is likely used in a larger project that involves running experiments on different clusters. The control scatter-gather service is used as a fallback for requests that do not specify an experiment cluster, while the experiment scatter-gather services are used for requests that do specify a cluster. This allows for easy testing and comparison of different algorithms or configurations on different clusters. 

Example usage:
```
// create control scatter-gather service
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> controlService = new ControlScatterGatherService();

// create experiment scatter-gather services map
Map<ExperimentCluster, ScatterGatherService<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse>> experimentServices = new HashMap<>();
experimentServices.put(ExperimentCluster.CLUSTER_A, new ExperimentScatterGatherServiceA());
experimentServices.put(ExperimentCluster.CLUSTER_B, new ExperimentScatterGatherServiceB());

// create scatter-gather with experiment redirects service
ScatterGatherWithExperimentRedirectsService service = new ScatterGatherWithExperimentRedirectsService(controlService, experimentServices);

// apply request to service
EarlybirdRequestContext request = new EarlybirdRequestContext(new EarlybirdRequest());
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = service.apply(request);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a service that redirects requests to different scatter-gather services based on an experiment cluster specified in the request.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `com.twitter.finagle` and `com.twitter.search` libraries, as well as the `org.slf4j` logging library.
3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
   - The `apply` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object as input and returns a `Future` of an `EarlybirdResponse` object as output. The response object contains a response code and a debug string.
