The `FullArchiveServingRangeProvider` class is responsible for providing a `ServingRange` object that specifies the range of tweets to be searched by the Earlybird search engine. This class implements the `ServingRangeProvider` interface, which requires the implementation of the `getServingRange` method. 

The `getServingRange` method takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and a boolean flag `useBoundaryOverride`. It returns a `ServingRange` object that specifies the range of tweets to be searched. 

The `ServingRange` object has four methods: `getServingRangeSinceId`, `getServingRangeMaxId`, `getServingRangeSinceTimeSecondsFromEpoch`, and `getServingRangeUntilTimeSecondsFromEpoch`. 

The `getServingRangeSinceId` method returns the ID of the earliest tweet to be searched. In this case, it returns 1L instead of 0L because the `since_id` operator is inclusive in Earlybird. 

The `getServingRangeMaxId` method returns the ID of the latest tweet to be searched. It calculates the boundary time by subtracting the serving range end time (which is either the value of the `decider` object's availability for the `deciderKey` or the default value of 48 hours ago) from the created time of the `requestContext` object. It then generates a valid status ID using the `SnowflakeIdParser` class. 

The `getServingRangeSinceTimeSecondsFromEpoch` method returns the timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) of the earliest tweet to be searched. In this case, it returns the timestamp of March 21, 2006, which is the date when Twitter was launched. 

The `getServingRangeUntilTimeSecondsFromEpoch` method returns the timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) of the latest tweet to be searched. It calculates the boundary time in the same way as the `getServingRangeMaxId` method and returns its value divided by 1000. 

Overall, the `FullArchiveServingRangeProvider` class provides a way to specify the range of tweets to be searched by the Earlybird search engine based on the `decider` object's availability for the `deciderKey` or a default value, as well as the created time of the `requestContext` object. It also sets the earliest tweet to be searched to the launch date of Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a serving range for a Twitter search based on a given request context and a search decider.

2. What is the significance of the FULL_ARCHIVE_START_DATE constant?
- The FULL_ARCHIVE_START_DATE constant represents the date when Twitter's full archive search began.

3. What is the purpose of the SearchDecider and deciderKey parameters in the constructor?
- The SearchDecider and deciderKey parameters are used to determine the serving range boundary for the search.
