The ResponseCodeStatFilter class is a filter that is used to count the number of responses with a particular response code. This filter is used in the Earlybird search service to collect metrics on the number of responses with each response code. 

The filter extends the SimpleFilter class from the Finagle library, which is a library for building asynchronous, non-blocking, and composable network services. The filter takes an EarlybirdRequest object and an EarlybirdResponse object as input and output, respectively. 

The filter creates a map of SearchCounter objects, where each counter is associated with a particular EarlybirdResponseCode. The EarlybirdResponseCode is an enum that represents the different response codes that can be returned by the Earlybird search service. 

When the filter is applied to a request, it calls the apply method of the underlying service and adds a FutureEventListener to the returned Future object. The FutureEventListener is notified when the Future completes, either successfully or with an exception. 

If the Future completes successfully, the onSuccess method of the FutureEventListener is called with the EarlybirdResponse object. The filter then increments the SearchCounter associated with the response code of the EarlybirdResponse object. 

If the Future completes with an exception, the onFailure method of the FutureEventListener is called, but the filter does not do anything in this case. 

Overall, the ResponseCodeStatFilter is a useful filter for collecting metrics on the number of responses with each response code in the Earlybird search service. The filter can be used in conjunction with other filters and services in the Earlybird search service to provide a comprehensive set of metrics for monitoring and debugging the service. 

Example usage:

```java
ResponseCodeStatFilter filter = new ResponseCodeStatFilter();
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> service = ... // create Earlybird search service
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> filteredService = filter.andThen(service);
```

In this example, a ResponseCodeStatFilter object is created and used to wrap an existing Earlybird search service. The resulting filteredService object can be used to handle EarlybirdRequest objects and returns EarlybirdResponse objects while also collecting metrics on the number of responses with each response code.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a filter called `ResponseCodeStatFilter` that counts the number of responses with each response code and exports them as metrics.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.google.common.collect.Maps` library and the `com.twitter` libraries for Finagle, SimpleFilter, and Future.

3. How are the response codes counted and exported as metrics?
- The `ResponseCodeStatFilter` constructor initializes a map of `EarlybirdResponseCode` to `SearchCounter` objects, where each `SearchCounter` is named after the corresponding response code. When a response is received, the `onSuccess` method of the `FutureEventListener` increments the `SearchCounter` for the response code of the received response. The `SearchCounter` objects are exported as metrics.
