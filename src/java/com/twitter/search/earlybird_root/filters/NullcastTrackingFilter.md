The `NullcastTrackingFilter` class is a filter that tracks unexpected nullcast results from Earlybirds. It extends the `SensitiveResultsTrackingFilter` class and overrides its methods to provide specific functionality. 

The purpose of this filter is to identify and track unexpected nullcast tweets that are returned in Earlybird search results. Nullcast tweets are tweets that are returned in search results but are not actually related to the search query. This can happen due to a bug in the Earlybird system. The filter tracks these tweets and counts them as sensitive results.

The `NullcastTrackingFilter` class has several methods that are used to implement this functionality. The `getSensitiveResults` method is used to identify the nullcast tweets in the search results. It checks if the search query contains the nullcast operator and if it does not, it calls the `EarlybirdResponseUtil.findUnexpectedNullcastStatusIds` method to find the unexpected nullcast tweets in the search results. If the search query contains the nullcast operator, it returns an empty set.

The `getExceptedResults` method is used to extract the scoring request tweet IDs. Some Earlybird requests are not searches, instead, they are scoring requests. These requests supply a list of IDs to be scored. It is OK to return nullcast tweet result if the ID is supplied in the request. This method extracts the scoring request tweet IDs.

The `NullcastTrackingFilter` class also has several static variables that are used to count the number of unexpected nullcast queries and results. These variables are used to track the number of nullcast tweets that are returned in search results.

Overall, the `NullcastTrackingFilter` class is an important part of the Earlybird system. It helps to identify and track unexpected nullcast tweets that are returned in search results. This information can be used to improve the Earlybird system and ensure that it returns accurate search results. 

Example usage:

```
NullcastTrackingFilter filter = new NullcastTrackingFilter();
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(request);
EarlybirdResponse earlybirdResponse = new EarlybirdResponse();
Set<Long> sensitiveResults = filter.getSensitiveResults(requestContext, earlybirdResponse);
Set<Long> exceptedResults = filter.getExceptedResults(requestContext);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a filter that tracks unexpected nullcast results from Earlybirds.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on several other packages, including Google Guava, SLF4J, and Twitter Search.
3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
   - This code tracks two metrics: `unexpected_nullcast_query_count` and `unexpected_nullcast_result_count`, both of which are SearchCounters.
