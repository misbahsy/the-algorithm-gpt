The `RequestSuccessStatsFilter` class is a filter that records statistics for requests that do not go through the ScatterGatherService. The purpose of this filter is to record cancellations, timeouts, and failures for requests that are not handled by the ScatterGatherService. The ScatterGatherService is responsible for handling requests that are sent to multiple services and aggregating the responses. 

This filter is implemented as a `SimpleFilter` that takes an `EarlybirdRequest` and an `EarlybirdResponse` as input and output, respectively. The `RequestSuccessStatsFilter` class has a constructor that takes a `RequestSuccessStats` object as input. The `RequestSuccessStats` object is used to record the statistics for the requests that pass through this filter. 

When a request is received, the filter records the start time of the request and passes the request to the next service in the chain. The filter then waits for the response from the service and records the end time of the request. If the response is successful, the filter checks the response code to determine if the request was cancelled, timed out, or failed. If the request was cancelled, timed out, or failed, the filter increments the appropriate counter in the `RequestSuccessStats` object. The filter also records the latency of the request and whether the request was successful or not. 

If the request fails, the filter records the end time of the request and increments the appropriate counter in the `RequestSuccessStats` object. The filter also checks the exception that caused the failure to determine if the request was cancelled, timed out, or failed. 

This filter is used in the larger project to record statistics for requests that do not go through the ScatterGatherService. The statistics recorded by this filter can be used to monitor the health of the system and identify any issues that may be affecting the performance of the system. 

Example usage:

```java
RequestSuccessStats stats = new RequestSuccessStats();
RequestSuccessStatsFilter filter = new RequestSuccessStatsFilter(stats);

// create a service chain with the filter
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> service = new MyService()
    .andThen(filter)
    .andThen(new ScatterGatherService());

// send a request through the service chain
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = service.apply(request);

// wait for the response and check the statistics
response.onSuccess(r -> {
    // check the statistics
    System.out.println("Cancelled requests: " + stats.getCancelledRequestCount().get());
    System.out.println("Timed out requests: " + stats.getTimedoutRequestCount().get());
    System.out.println("Errored requests: " + stats.getErroredRequestCount().get());
});
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a filter that records cancellations, timeouts, and failures for requests that do not go through ScatterGatherService.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on several Twitter libraries, including Finagle and util.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
    
    This code takes an EarlybirdRequest as input and returns an EarlybirdResponse as output. It is designed to be used as a filter in a larger service.
