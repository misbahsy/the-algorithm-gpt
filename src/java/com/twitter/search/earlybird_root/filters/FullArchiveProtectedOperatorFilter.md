The `FullArchiveProtectedOperatorFilter` class is a filter that validates requests with a protected operator, appends the '[exclude protected]' operator by default, and appends '[filter protected]' operator instead if 'getProtectedTweetsOnly' request param is set. The purpose of this filter is to ensure that the query passed to the search service does not contain more than one 'protected' operator, and that the operator is in the query root node, the parent node of the 'protected' operator must not be negated and must be a conjunction, and if there is a positive 'protected' operator, 'followedUserIds' and 'searcherId' request params must be set. 

The filter is implemented as a `SimpleFilter` that takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` and an `EarlybirdResponse` as input and returns a `Future` of `EarlybirdResponse`. The `EarlybirdRequestContext` contains the parsed query, and the `EarlybirdResponse` is the response returned by the search service. The filter first checks if the parsed query is null, and if it is, it returns the `EarlybirdResponse` returned by the search service. If the parsed query is not null, the filter tries to find a protected operator in the query. If there is no protected operator, the filter appends '[exclude protected]' by default. If there is a protected operator, the filter checks if it is in the query root node, the parent node of the 'protected' operator must not be negated and must be a conjunction, and if there is a positive 'protected' operator, 'followedUserIds' and 'searcherId' request params must be set. If the 'getProtectedTweetsOnly' request param is set, the filter updates the processed query by dropping the protected operator and appending '[filter protected]' operator. 

The `FullArchiveProtectedOperatorFilter` class is used in the larger project to ensure that the query passed to the search service is valid and does not contain more than one 'protected' operator. This filter is part of a chain of filters that are applied to the search request before it is passed to the search service. The purpose of these filters is to validate the search request and modify it if necessary to ensure that it is valid and can be processed by the search service. 

Example usage:

```java
FullArchiveProtectedOperatorFilter filter = new FullArchiveProtectedOperatorFilter(dropProtectedOperatorVisitor, decider);
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(parsedQuery);
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = filter.apply(requestContext, searchService);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code is a filter for a full archive service that validates requests with a protected operator, appends the '[exclude protected]' operator by default, and appends '[filter protected]' operator instead if 'getProtectedTweetsOnly' request param is set. It returns a client error response if any of the rules is violated.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries such as `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.search.common.decider`, `com.twitter.search.common.metrics`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.common`, `com.twitter.search.queryparser.query`, and `com.twitter.search.queryparser.visitors`.

3. What are the rules that a query must follow to pass through this filter?
- A query must follow the following rules to pass through this filter:
  1. There is at most one 'protected' operator in the query.
  2. If there is a 'protected' operator, it must be in the query root node.
  3. The parent node of the 'protected' operator must not be negated and must be a conjunction.
  4. If there is a positive 'protected' operator, 'followedUserIds' and 'searcherId' request params must be set.
