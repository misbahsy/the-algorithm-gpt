The `DeadlineTimeoutStatsFilter` is a filter that is used to track and compare the request deadline and request timeout for a given client. The purpose of this filter is to track the stats per client for requests where the request deadline is set to expire before the EarlybirdRequest timeout, and also requests where the deadline allows enough time for the EarlybirdRequest timeout to kick in. 

The filter is implemented as a `SimpleFilter` that takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` and returns an `EarlybirdResponse`. The filter uses Guava's `LoadingCache` to store and retrieve the stats for each client. The stats are stored in different caches based on the type of stat being tracked. 

The `DeadlineTimeoutStatsFilter` tracks the following stats per client:
- `requestTimeoutNotSetStats`: The number of requests where the request timeout is not set.
- `finagleDeadlineNotSetStats`: The number of requests where the finagle deadline is not set.
- `finagleDeadlineAndRequestTimeoutNotSetStats`: The number of requests where both the finagle deadline and request timeout are not set.
- `requestTimeoutStats`: The time taken for requests where the request timeout is set.
- `finagleDeadlineStats`: The time taken for requests where the finagle deadline is set.
- `deadlineLargerStats`: The time difference between the finagle deadline and request timeout for requests where the finagle deadline is larger than the request timeout.
- `deadlineSmallerStats`: The time difference between the finagle deadline and request timeout for requests where the finagle deadline is smaller than the request timeout.

The `DeadlineTimeoutStatsFilter` uses the `getRequestTimeout` method to get the request timeout from the `EarlybirdRequest`. If the request timeout is not set in the `EarlybirdRequest`, the method returns -1. The filter then uses the `Contexts` class from Finagle to get the finagle deadline for the request. If the finagle deadline is not set, the filter increments the `finagleDeadlineNotSetStats` counter. If the request timeout is set, the filter increments the `requestTimeoutStats` counter. If both the finagle deadline and request timeout are not set, the filter increments the `finagleDeadlineAndRequestTimeoutNotSetStats` counter. If both the finagle deadline and request timeout are set, the filter calculates the time difference between the finagle deadline and request timeout and increments either the `deadlineLargerStats` or `deadlineSmallerStats` counter based on the result.

Overall, the `DeadlineTimeoutStatsFilter` is an important filter for tracking and comparing the request deadline and request timeout for a given client. The stats tracked by this filter can be used to monitor the performance of the system and identify any issues that may arise.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this filter and how does it work?
- This filter compares the request deadline with the request timeout set in the EarlybirdRequest and tracks stats per client for requests where the deadline is set to expire before the timeout and requests where the deadline allows enough time for the timeout to kick in. It uses Guava's LoadingCache to store and retrieve stats per client.

2. What are the different types of stats being tracked by this filter?
- This filter tracks the following stats per client: (1) requests where the request timeout is not set, (2) requests where the finagle deadline is not set, (3) requests where both the finagle deadline and request timeout are not set, (4) request timeout, (5) finagle deadline, (6) deadline larger than request timeout, and (7) deadline smaller than request timeout.

3. What is the purpose of the getRequestTimeout method?
- The getRequestTimeout method retrieves the request timeout from the EarlybirdRequest. It first checks if the timeout is set in the search query collector termination params, and if not, it checks if it is set in the request itself. If neither is set, it returns -1.
