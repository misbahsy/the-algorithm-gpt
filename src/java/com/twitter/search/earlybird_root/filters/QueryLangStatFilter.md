The QueryLangStatFilter class is a filter that is used to export statistics for query languages. It is a part of the Earlybird project from Twitter. The purpose of this filter is to count the number of queries in different languages and export these statistics for monitoring and analysis purposes. 

The filter is implemented as a SimpleFilter that takes an EarlybirdRequestContext and an EarlybirdResponse as input and output respectively. The filter extracts the language of the query from the request context and increments the corresponding counter for that language. If the language is not specified in the request context, the filter tries to determine the language from the user's language settings. If the language cannot be determined, the filter uses a default language code.

The filter uses a ConcurrentHashMap to store the counters for each language. If the number of languages exceeds a certain limit, the filter uses a single counter to count the queries for all languages that exceed the limit. This is done to prevent the creation of too many counters, which could cause performance issues.

The filter is injected with a Config object that specifies the maximum number of languages that can be counted. The filter also uses the SearchCounter class from the Twitter Search Common library to create and manage the counters.

This filter can be used in the Earlybird project to monitor the usage of different languages in search queries. The statistics can be used to optimize the search engine for different languages and to identify trends and patterns in the usage of different languages. 

Example usage:

```java
QueryLangStatFilter.Config config = new QueryLangStatFilter.Config(10);
QueryLangStatFilter filter = new QueryLangStatFilter(config);

// Create a service that uses the filter
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> service = new MyService().andThen(filter);

// Send a request to the service
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();
requestContext.getRequest().getSearchQuery().setQueryLang("en");
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = service.apply(requestContext);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code is a Java class that implements a filter for a Twitter search service. It counts the number of queries in different languages and exports the statistics.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries, including Guava, Twitter Common, and Twitter Finagle. It also depends on some internal Thrift classes and utilities.

3. What is the purpose of the `Config` class and how is it used?
- The `Config` class is a nested class that defines a configuration object for the filter. It specifies the maximum number of languages to track. This configuration is passed to the filter's constructor and used to initialize the `config` field.
