The `FullArchiveRootServer` class is a subclass of `SearchRootServer` and is responsible for creating and managing a server that provides access to the `EarlybirdService` interface. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves searching and analyzing Twitter data.

The `FullArchiveRootServer` constructor takes two arguments: a `FullArchiveRootService` instance and a `Service<byte[], byte[]>` instance. The `FullArchiveRootService` is a custom service that likely provides some functionality related to searching and analyzing Twitter data. The `Service<byte[], byte[]>` instance is a Finagle service that handles byte arrays as input and output. Finagle is a library for building scalable and fault-tolerant network services, and it is used extensively at Twitter.

The `FullArchiveRootServer` class is annotated with `@Inject`, which means that it can be instantiated and managed by a dependency injection framework such as Guice. This allows the server to be easily configured and customized by the larger project.

Overall, the `FullArchiveRootServer` class is a key component of the larger project that provides access to the `EarlybirdService` interface. It likely handles incoming requests related to searching and analyzing Twitter data, and delegates the actual work to the `FullArchiveRootService` instance. Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```java
FullArchiveRootService fullArchiveService = new FullArchiveRootService();
Service<byte[], byte[]> byteService = new MyByteService();
FullArchiveRootServer server = new FullArchiveRootServer(fullArchiveService, byteService);
server.start();
```

This code creates a new `FullArchiveRootService` instance, a custom `MyByteService` instance that implements the `Service<byte[], byte[]>` interface, and a new `FullArchiveRootServer` instance that uses these two services. The `start()` method is then called on the server to start listening for incoming requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   This code defines a FullArchiveRootServer class that extends the SearchRootServer class and takes in a FullArchiveRootService and a Service<byte[], byte[]> as parameters. It is likely used to handle requests related to the EarlybirdService.

2. What is the relationship between this code and the EarlybirdService?
   This code is related to the EarlybirdService as it extends the SearchRootServer class with the EarlybirdService.ServiceIface interface and takes in a FullArchiveRootService, which is likely used to handle requests related to the EarlybirdService.

3. What is the significance of the @Inject annotation in this code?
   The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that the FullArchiveRootServer constructor is being used for dependency injection, which means that the FullArchiveRootService and Service<byte[], byte[]> parameters are being provided by an external source rather than being instantiated within the class itself.
