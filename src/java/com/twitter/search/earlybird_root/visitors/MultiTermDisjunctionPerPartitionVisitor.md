The `MultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionVisitor` class is responsible for truncating user ID or ID lists in [multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id] queries. It returns null if the query has incorrect operators or if it looked at the wrong field. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The `MultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionVisitor` class extends the `SearchQueryTransformer` class, which is a part of the `com.twitter.search.queryparser.query.search` package. It overrides three methods: `visit(Conjunction query)`, `visit(Disjunction disjunction)`, and `visit(SearchOperator operator)`. 

The `isTargetedQuery(Query query)` method checks if the query is a targeted query. A targeted query is a query that is a [multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id] query. If the query is a targeted query, the `extractIds(SearchOperator operator)` method extracts the user IDs or IDs from the query. If there are no user IDs or IDs left in the query, the `visit(SearchOperator operator)` method returns `Conjunction.EMPTY_CONJUNCTION` if the query is a negation (i.e., occur == MUST_NOT), and `NO_MATCH_CONJUNCTION` if it is not a negation. If there are user IDs or IDs left in the query, the `visit(SearchOperator operator)` method truncates the user IDs or IDs and returns the modified query.

The `visit(Conjunction query)` method visits the conjunction query and returns the modified query. If any child is a "multi_term_disjunction from_user_id" and returns `Conjunction.NO_MATCH_CONJUNCTION`, it should be considered the same as matching no documents. The `visit(Disjunction disjunction)` method visits the disjunction query and returns the modified query.

The `MultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionVisitor` class is used in the larger project to optimize search queries. By truncating user IDs or IDs in [multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id] queries, the search queries can be processed more efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a visitor that truncates user id or id lists in [multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id] queries and returns null if the query has incorrect operators or looked at the wrong field.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the following external libraries: `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList` and `com.google.common.collect.Lists`.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The expected input of this code is a `Query` object, and the expected output is a modified `Query` object with truncated user id or id lists in [multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id] queries. If the query has incorrect operators or looked at the wrong field, the output is null.
