This code defines a module for a scatter-gather service that is used in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The scatter-gather service is used to query multiple servers in parallel and aggregate the results. The module is called `ProtectedScatterGatherModule` and extends another module called `ScatterGatherModule`. 

The `ProtectedScatterGatherModule` provides a method called `provideScatterGatherService` that returns a `Service` object. This method takes several parameters, including `scatterGatherSupport`, `requestSuccessStats`, `partitionLoggingSupport`, `requestContextToEarlybirdRequestFilter`, `partitionAccessController`, `partitionConfig`, `rootClientServiceBuilder`, `expClusterRootClientServiceBuilder`, `altPartitionConfig`, `altRootClientServiceBuilder`, `statsReceiver`, `cluster`, and `decider`. 

The purpose of this method is to build and configure a scatter-gather service for a protected cluster. The `scatterGatherSupport` parameter provides support for the scatter-gather service, while the `requestSuccessStats` parameter tracks statistics about successful requests. The `partitionLoggingSupport` parameter provides logging support for the partitions, and the `requestContextToEarlybirdRequestFilter` parameter filters the request context to an Earlybird request. The `partitionAccessController` parameter controls access to the partitions, and the `partitionConfig` parameter provides configuration for the partitions. 

The `rootClientServiceBuilder` parameter builds a root client service for the scatter-gather service, while the `expClusterRootClientServiceBuilder` parameter builds a root client service for the experimental cluster (which is not used in this module). The `altPartitionConfig` and `altRootClientServiceBuilder` parameters provide an alternative configuration and root client service for the scatter-gather service. The `statsReceiver` parameter receives statistics about the scatter-gather service, while the `cluster` parameter specifies the Earlybird cluster to use. Finally, the `decider` parameter decides whether to search the protected cluster or the experimental cluster.

Overall, this code defines a module that provides a scatter-gather service for a protected cluster in The Algorithm from Twitter project. The scatter-gather service is used to query multiple servers in parallel and aggregate the results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a scatterGatherService for the protected cluster.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including `EarlybirdService`, `SearchDecider`, `PartitionConfig`, and `RootClientServiceBuilder`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `provideScatterGatherService` method?
- The `provideScatterGatherService` method is expected to take in several parameters and return a `Service` object that takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` and returns an `EarlybirdResponse`.
