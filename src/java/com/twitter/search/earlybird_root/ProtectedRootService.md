The `ProtectedRootService` class is a service that handles requests to the Earlybird search system from authenticated clients. It is a part of the larger Earlybird search project from Twitter. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a pipeline of filters that process incoming requests and outgoing responses. These filters perform various tasks such as logging, validation, tracking, and caching. The filters are applied to the request in a specific order, and the resulting request is passed to a scatter-gather service that performs the actual search. The response from the scatter-gather service is then passed through the filters in reverse order before being returned to the client.

The `ProtectedRootService` class implements the `EarlybirdService.ServiceIface` interface, which defines the methods for handling requests. The `search` method is the main entry point for handling search requests. It takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object as input and returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object. The `allFiltersAndService` field is a `Service` object that represents the pipeline of filters and the scatter-gather service.

The `ProtectedRootService` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class is created and shared across the application. This is useful for performance and memory management.

Overall, the `ProtectedRootService` class provides a robust and extensible framework for processing search requests in the Earlybird search system. Developers can add or remove filters as needed to customize the behavior of the system. Here is an example of how to use the `ProtectedRootService` class:

```java
// create an instance of the service
ProtectedRootService service = new ProtectedRootService(/* filters */);

// handle a search request
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest(/* search parameters */);
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = service.search(request);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a protected root service for the Earlybird search feature on Twitter. It sets up a chain of filters to handle requests and applies them to the search service.

2. What are some of the filters being used in this code and what do they do?
- Some of the filters being used include LoggingFilter, RequestValidationFilter, FinagleClientStatsFilter, and RecencyCacheFilter. These filters handle tasks such as logging requests and responses, validating requests, tracking client statistics, and caching search results.

3. What is the purpose of the ProtectedScatterGatherModule and how is it used in this code?
- The ProtectedScatterGatherModule is used to define a named scatter-gather service for the Earlybird search feature. This service is then passed as a parameter to the ProtectedRootService constructor and used in the allFiltersAndService chain to handle search requests.
