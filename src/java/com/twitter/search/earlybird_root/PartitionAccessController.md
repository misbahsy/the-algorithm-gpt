The `PartitionAccessController` class is responsible for determining whether a root should send requests to certain partitions based on whether they have been turned off by a decider. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is a search engine that allows users to search for tweets based on keywords, hashtags, and other criteria.

The `PartitionAccessController` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: a `String` representing the name of the cluster, and a `SearchDecider` object representing the partition decider. The `SearchDecider` object is used to determine whether a partition should be skipped or not.

The `canAccessPartition` method takes four parameters: a `String` representing the name of the tier, an `int` representing the partition number, a `String` representing the client ID, and an `EarlybirdRequestType` object representing the type of request. This method is designed to be used to quickly stop hitting a partition if there are problems with it.

The method first creates a `String` representing the name of the partition decider based on the cluster name, tier name, and partition number. It then checks whether the partition decider is available using the `isAvailable` method of the `SearchDecider` object. If the partition decider is available, the method increments a counter and returns `false`, indicating that the root should not send requests to that partition.

The method then creates three more `String`s representing the client decider name, the request type decider name, and the client request type decider name. It checks whether each of these deciders is available using the `isAvailable` method of the `SearchDecider` object. If any of these deciders are available, the method increments a counter and returns `false`.

If none of the deciders are available, the method returns `true`, indicating that the root should send requests to the partition.

Overall, the `PartitionAccessController` class is an important part of the search engine's infrastructure, as it helps to ensure that requests are only sent to partitions that are available and working properly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to determine if a root should send requests to certain partitions based on if they have been turned off by decider.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several classes from the `com.twitter.search` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.common` packages, as well as the `javax.inject` package.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `canAccessPartition` method?
- The `canAccessPartition` method takes in several parameters including `tierName`, `partitionNum`, `clientId`, and `requestType`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the root should send requests to the given partition.
