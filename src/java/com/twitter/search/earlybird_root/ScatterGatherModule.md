The ScatterGatherModule class is a module that provides a scatter-gather service for Earlybird clusters. The purpose of this module is to provide a service that can handle search requests for Earlybird clusters. The scatter-gather service is used to distribute search requests across multiple partitions in the cluster, and then gather the results from each partition and combine them into a single response. 

The module provides an abstract method called provideScatterGatherService that must be implemented by subclasses. This method takes several parameters, including a scatterGatherSupport object, a requestSuccessStats object, a partitionLoggingSupport object, a requestContextToEarlybirdRequestFilter object, a partitionAccessController object, a partitionConfig object, a rootClientServiceBuilder object, an expClusterRootClientServiceBuilder object, an altPartitionConfig object, an altRootClientServiceBuilder object, a statsReceiver object, an EarlybirdCluster object, and a SearchDecider object. 

The module also provides a method called buildScatterOrSplitterService that is used to build the scatter-gather service. This method takes many of the same parameters as the provideScatterGatherService method, but also includes a decider object. The decider object is used to determine whether to use the scatter-gather service or a splitter service. The splitter service is used when an alternate client configuration is available. 

The module also provides a method called createScatterGatherService that is used to create the scatter-gather service. This method takes many of the same parameters as the buildScatterOrSplitterService method, but also includes a nameSuffix and a clientName. The nameSuffix is used to create a unique name for the scatter-gather service, while the clientName is used to create a unique name for the root client service builder. 

Overall, the ScatterGatherModule class is an important part of the Earlybird search system. It provides a scatter-gather service that is used to distribute search requests across multiple partitions in the cluster, and then gather the results from each partition and combine them into a single response. This allows the Earlybird search system to handle large volumes of search requests efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides an abstract class called ScatterGatherModule that extends TwitterModule and contains methods for building a scatter-gather service for Earlybird clusters. It solves the problem of efficiently searching for tweets across multiple partitions in a distributed system.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including EarlybirdService, SearchDecider, PartitionConfig, RootClientServiceBuilder, and several others. It also imports several packages from the javax and org.slf4j libraries.

3. What is the difference between the provideScatterGatherService and buildScatterOrSplitterService methods?
- The provideScatterGatherService method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses of ScatterGatherModule. It provides the scatter-gather service for single tier Earlybird clusters. The buildScatterOrSplitterService method is a protected method that builds a scatter-gather service or a splitter service depending on whether an alternate client configuration is available.
