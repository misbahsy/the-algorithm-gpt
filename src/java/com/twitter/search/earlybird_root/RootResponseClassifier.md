The `RootResponseClassifier` class is a response classifier for the Earlybird service at Twitter. It extends the `AbstractPartialFunction` class from the Scala library and implements two methods: `isDefinedAt` and `apply`. 

The purpose of this class is to classify responses from the Earlybird service into different categories based on the response code. The response code is an instance of the `EarlybirdResponseCode` enum, which is defined in the `EarlybirdResponse` class. The categories are defined by the `ResponseClass` enum, which is part of the Finagle library used by Twitter.

The `isDefinedAt` method checks whether the request and response are valid Earlybird requests and responses. If the request is not an instance of `EarlybirdService.search_args`, the method increments a counter and returns `false`. If the response is not an instance of `EarlybirdResponse`, the method increments a counter and returns `false`. Otherwise, the method returns `true`.

The `apply` method is called when the response is defined and returns the appropriate `ResponseClass` based on the response code. If the response is a non-retryable failure, the method increments a counter and returns `ResponseClasses.NON_RETRYABLE_FAILURE`. If the response is a retryable failure, the method increments a counter and returns `ResponseClasses.RETRYABLE_FAILURE`. Otherwise, the method increments a counter and returns `ResponseClasses.SUCCESS`.

This class is used in the Earlybird service to classify responses and track metrics for different categories of responses. For example, the `NON_RETRYABLE_FAILURE_COUNTER` counter is used to track the number of non-retryable failures, such as when a partition is disabled or a persistent error occurs. The `RETRYABLE_FAILURE_COUNTER` counter is used to track the number of retryable failures, such as when a transient error occurs. The `SUCCESS_COUNTER` counter is used to track the number of successful responses. These metrics can be used to monitor the health of the Earlybird service and identify areas for improvement.

Example usage:
```
RootResponseClassifier classifier = new RootResponseClassifier();
ResponseClass responseClass = classifier.apply(reqRep);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a custom response classifier for the EarlybirdService search API in Twitter's search system. It categorizes responses into success, retryable failure, and non-retryable failure based on the response code.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    
    This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including Scala, Finagle, and Twitter's EarlybirdService and SearchRateCounter.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
    
    This code tracks several metrics using Twitter's SearchRateCounter library, including the number of requests and responses that are not EarlybirdService search requests or responses, the number of non-retryable and retryable failures, and the number of successful responses.
