The `SearchResultsValidator` class is a service response validator that is used to validate the response received from the Earlybird service of Twitter. The purpose of this class is to ensure that the response contains the necessary search results and status IDs that are required by the calling application. 

The class implements the `ServiceResponseValidator` interface, which defines a single method `validate` that takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object as input and returns a `Future` object that contains the validated response. The `validate` method first checks if the `EarlybirdResponse` object contains the search results and results set. If either of these is not set, the method throws an exception with a message indicating that the search results were not set. 

Next, the method checks if the `maxSearchedStatusID` is set in the response. If it is not set, the method throws an exception with a message indicating that the `maxSearchedStatusID` was not set. 

If both the search results and `maxSearchedStatusID` are set, the method checks if the response was early terminated. If the response was not early terminated and the `minSearchedStatusID` is not set, the method throws an exception with a message indicating that the `minSearchedStatusID` was not set. 

If all the required fields are set, the method returns the validated `EarlybirdResponse` object. 

This class is used in the larger Earlybird project of Twitter to ensure that the response received from the Earlybird service is valid and contains all the necessary information required by the calling application. An example usage of this class is shown below:

```
EarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster();
SearchResultsValidator validator = new SearchResultsValidator(cluster);
EarlybirdResponse response = new EarlybirdResponse();
// set the necessary fields in the response object
Future<EarlybirdResponse> validatedResponse = validator.validate(response);
validatedResponse.onSuccess(validResponse -> {
  // handle the validated response
}).onFailure(error -> {
  // handle the validation error
});
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a validator for search results in the Earlybird system from Twitter.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on the `EarlybirdCluster` class and the `EarlybirdResponse` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.schema.earlybird` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift` packages, respectively.

3. What does the `validate` method do?
- The `validate` method takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object as input and checks if it has search results and if those results have certain properties set. If the response is valid, it returns a `Future` containing the response object. If the response is invalid, it returns a `Future` containing an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating what was missing or incorrect in the response.
