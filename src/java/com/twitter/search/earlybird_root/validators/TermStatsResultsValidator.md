The `TermStatsResultsValidator` class is a service response validator for the Earlybird search system at Twitter. It is responsible for validating the response received from the EarlybirdCluster and ensuring that it contains valid term statistics results. 

The class implements the `ServiceResponseValidator` interface, which requires the implementation of a single method `validate()`. This method takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object as input and returns a `Future` object that contains the validated response. 

The `TermStatsResultsValidator` constructor takes an `EarlybirdCluster` object as input and assigns it to the `cluster` field. This cluster object is used to generate an error message if the response is invalid. 

The `validate()` method first checks if the `EarlybirdResponse` object contains term statistics results and term results. If either of these is not set, it generates an exception with an error message that includes the name of the cluster that returned the invalid response. If the response is valid, it returns a `Future` object containing the validated response. 

This class is likely used in the larger Earlybird search system to ensure that the results returned by the clusters are valid and can be used by downstream processes. An example usage of this class might look like:

```
EarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster();
// perform search and get response
EarlybirdResponse response = cluster.search(query);
TermStatsResultsValidator validator = new TermStatsResultsValidator(cluster);
Future<EarlybirdResponse> validatedResponse = validator.validate(response);
// use validated response for downstream processing
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a validator for the results of a search algorithm called Earlybird, specifically for the term statistics results.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on the `EarlybirdCluster` class and the `EarlybirdResponse` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.schema.earlybird` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift` packages, respectively.

3. What does the `validate` method do?
   - The `validate` method checks if the `EarlybirdResponse` object passed as a parameter has term statistics results and term results set. If not, it throws an exception with a message indicating which cluster returned null results. Otherwise, it returns the same `EarlybirdResponse` object.
