The TopTweetsResultsValidator class is a service response validator for the Earlybird search system at Twitter. It implements the ServiceResponseValidator interface and is used to validate the response from a search query. The purpose of this class is to ensure that the search results are properly set in the response object.

The class takes an EarlybirdCluster object as a parameter in its constructor. This object represents the cluster that the search query was executed on. The cluster is used in the error message if the search results are not set in the response.

The validate method takes an EarlybirdResponse object as a parameter and returns a Future object that contains the validated EarlybirdResponse. The method first checks if the search results are set in the response object. If they are not set, an IllegalStateException is thrown with an error message that includes the name of the cluster. If the search results are set, the method returns the validated EarlybirdResponse object.

This class is used in the larger Earlybird search system at Twitter to ensure that search results are properly set in the response object. It is likely used in conjunction with other validators to ensure that the response object is complete and valid before it is returned to the user.

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster("cluster1");
EarlybirdResponse response = new EarlybirdResponse();
response.setSearchResults(new SearchResults());
TopTweetsResultsValidator validator = new TopTweetsResultsValidator(cluster);
Future<EarlybirdResponse> validatedResponse = validator.validate(response);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code is a validator for the response of a search query in the Earlybird system from Twitter.

2. What is the EarlybirdCluster object and how is it used in this code?
   The EarlybirdCluster object is passed as a parameter to the constructor of the TopTweetsResultsValidator class and is used to generate an error message if the search results are not set.

3. What is the expected output of the validate() method?
   The validate() method returns a Future object that either contains the EarlybirdResponse object if the search results are set, or an exception if they are not set.
