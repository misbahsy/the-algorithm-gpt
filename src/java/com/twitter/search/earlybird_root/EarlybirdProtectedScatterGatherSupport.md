The code defines a class called EarlybirdProtectedScatterGatherSupport, which is a subclass of EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport. This class is used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the protected cluster. 

The class has a constructor that takes two arguments: a PartitionMappingManager and an EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger. These arguments are injected using the @Inject annotation. The constructor calls the constructor of the superclass, passing in the injected arguments as well as two additional arguments: EarlybirdCluster.PROTECTED and the featureSchemaMerger. 

The purpose of this class is to provide support for scattering and gathering requests to and from the earlybird partitions in the protected cluster. It is likely that this class is used in conjunction with other classes and components in the larger Earlybird project to provide a complete search and indexing solution for Twitter data. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
PartitionMappingManager partitionMappingManager = new PartitionMappingManager();
EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger featureSchemaMerger = new EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger();
EarlybirdProtectedScatterGatherSupport scatterGatherSupport = new EarlybirdProtectedScatterGatherSupport(partitionMappingManager, featureSchemaMerger);

// Use the scatterGatherSupport object to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the protected cluster
scatterGatherSupport.scatter(request);

// Gather the results from the earlybird partitions
List<Response> responses = scatterGatherSupport.gather();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is an implementation of EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the protected cluster.

2. What is the difference between EarlybirdProtectedScatterGatherSupport and the base class?
   - The main difference is that if the from user ID is not set, an exception is thrown.

3. What are the dependencies of this class?
   - This class has two dependencies: PartitionMappingManager and EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger, both of which are injected through the constructor using the @Inject annotation.
