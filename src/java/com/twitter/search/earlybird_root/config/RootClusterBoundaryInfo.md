The RootClusterBoundaryInfo class is used by the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter to provide time boundary information for a root cluster. It implements the ServingRange interface and provides methods to get the serving range since and max IDs, as well as the serving range since and until time seconds from epoch. 

The constructor takes in a start date, cluster end date, since ID boundary string, max ID boundary string, and a clock. The servingRangeSince and servingRangeMax fields are initialized using the newTierServingBoundaryEndPoint method of the TierServingBoundaryEndPoint class. This method takes in the since or max ID boundary string, the start or end date, and the clock, and returns a new TierServingBoundaryEndPoint object. 

The getServingRangeSinceId and getServingRangeMaxId methods return the boundary tweet IDs for the serving range since and max, respectively. The getServingRangeSinceTimeSecondsFromEpoch and getServingRangeUntilTimeSecondsFromEpoch methods return the boundary time seconds from epoch for the serving range since and until, respectively. 

Overall, this class provides a way to get time boundary information for a root cluster, which can be used by the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter to filter tweets based on their creation time. For example, if we have a root cluster that contains tweets from a certain time period, we can use this class to get the serving range since and max IDs and filter tweets that fall outside of this range. 

Example usage:

```
Date startDate = new Date(1609459200000L); // January 1, 2021
Date clusterEndDate = new Date(1640995199000L); // December 31, 2021
String sinceIdBoundaryString = "1234567890";
String maxIdBoundaryString = "2345678901";
Clock clock = Clock.SYSTEM_CLOCK;

RootClusterBoundaryInfo boundaryInfo = new RootClusterBoundaryInfo(startDate, clusterEndDate, sinceIdBoundaryString, maxIdBoundaryString, clock);

long sinceId = boundaryInfo.getServingRangeSinceId();
long maxId = boundaryInfo.getServingRangeMaxId();
long sinceTime = boundaryInfo.getServingRangeSinceTimeSecondsFromEpoch();
long untilTime = boundaryInfo.getServingRangeUntilTimeSecondsFromEpoch();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code defines a class called `RootClusterBoundaryInfo` that stores time boundary information for a root cluster and is used by `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter`.

2. What are the inputs required to create an instance of `RootClusterBoundaryInfo`?
- An instance of `RootClusterBoundaryInfo` can be created by passing in a `Date` object for the start date of the cluster, a `Date` object for the end date of the cluster, two `String` objects representing the since and max ID boundaries, and a `Clock` object.

3. What methods are available to retrieve information from an instance of `RootClusterBoundaryInfo`?
- There are four methods available to retrieve information from an instance of `RootClusterBoundaryInfo`: `getServingRangeSinceId()`, `getServingRangeMaxId()`, `getServingRangeSinceTimeSecondsFromEpoch()`, and `getServingRangeUntilTimeSecondsFromEpoch()`. These methods return `long` values representing the since and max tweet IDs and the since and until time in seconds from the epoch, respectively.
