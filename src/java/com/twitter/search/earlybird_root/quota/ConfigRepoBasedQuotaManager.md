The `ConfigRepoBasedQuotaManager` class is an implementation of the `ClientIdQuotaManager` interface that provides a way to manage quotas for clients based on a configuration file. It uses a `ConfigBasedQuotaConfig` object to load the contents of the config. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to manage quotas for clients in a distributed system. It takes into account the number of instances of the system running and adjusts the quota accordingly. 

The `getQuotaForClient` method takes a `clientId` as input and returns an `Optional` of `QuotaInfo`. It first checks if the `clientId` is present in the configuration file. If it is not present, it returns an empty `Optional`. If it is present, it calculates the quota value based on the number of instances of the system running and returns a new `QuotaInfo` object with the adjusted quota value. 

The `getCommonPoolQuota` method returns the quota information for the common pool client. It calls the `getQuotaForClient` method with the `COMMON_POOL_CLIENT_ID` constant as input and returns the `QuotaInfo` object if it is present. 

This class can be used in a larger project to manage quotas for clients in a distributed system. It provides a way to adjust the quota based on the number of instances of the system running, which ensures that the system is not overloaded with requests. 

Example usage:

```
ConfigBasedQuotaConfig quotaConfig = new ConfigBasedQuotaConfig(configFile);
SelfServerSetResolver serverSetResolver = new SelfServerSetResolver();
ConfigRepoBasedQuotaManager quotaManager = new ConfigRepoBasedQuotaManager(serverSetResolver, quotaConfig);

Optional<QuotaInfo> quotaInfo = quotaManager.getQuotaForClient("client1");
if (quotaInfo.isPresent()) {
  QuotaInfo quota = quotaInfo.get();
  // Use quota information
}

QuotaInfo commonPoolQuota = quotaManager.getCommonPoolQuota();
// Use common pool quota information
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an implementation of the `ClientIdQuotaManager` interface that uses a `ConfigBasedQuotaConfig` object to load the contents of the config.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on `SelfServerSetResolver`, `ConfigBasedQuotaConfig`, `QuotaInfo`, and `ClientIdQuotaManager`.

3. What is the significance of the `COMMON_POOL_CLIENT_ID` constant?
- The `COMMON_POOL_CLIENT_ID` constant is used to get the quota information for the common pool client, which is a predefined client ID.
