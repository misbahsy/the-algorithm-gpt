The `ConfigBasedQuotaConfig` class is responsible for periodically loading a JSON serialized map that contains quota information indexed by client ID. The class extends the `PeriodicFileLoader` class, which is responsible for periodically reloading the configuration file using a given executor service. 

The JSON object from the map is required to have an integer property that represents a client's quota. The key for the quota property is passed to this class. Optionally, it can have a `should_enforce` property of type boolean. If these two properties are not present, an exception will be thrown.

The `ConfigBasedQuotaConfig` class has a constructor that takes in the path to the configuration file, the key that will be used to extract client quotas, and a boolean flag that determines whether a client can be skipped if the associated object is missing the quota key. The class also has a method that returns the quota information for a specific client ID.

When the configuration file is loaded, the class stores the quota information in a map. The map is built using an `ImmutableMap.Builder` object. The class also keeps track of the total quota and the number of entries in the map using `SearchLongGauge` objects. 

The `ConfigBasedQuotaConfig` class is used in the larger project to manage the quota information for clients. Other parts of the project can use the `getQuotaForClient` method to retrieve the quota information for a specific client ID. The `SearchLongGauge` objects can be used to monitor the total quota and the number of entries in the map. 

Example usage:

```
ConfigBasedQuotaConfig quotaConfig = ConfigBasedQuotaConfig.newConfigBasedQuotaConfig(
    "/path/to/quota/config/file",
    "quota_key",
    true,
    executorService,
    clock
);

Optional<QuotaInfo> quotaInfo = quotaConfig.getQuotaForClient("client_id");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code periodically loads a JSON serialized map that contains quota information indexed by client ID, and stores it in a map. It also provides methods to retrieve quota information for a specific client ID.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries, including Google Guava, Apache Commons IO, and JSON.

3. What is the significance of the "should_enforce" and "archive_access" properties in the JSON objects?
- The "should_enforce" property is of type boolean and determines whether the quota for a client should be enforced. The "archive_access" property is also of type boolean and determines whether a client has access to archived data.
