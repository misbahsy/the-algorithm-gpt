[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/src/java/com/twitter/search/earlybird_root/FullArchiveRootAppMain.java)

The code is a Java class that extends the SearchRootAppMain class and provides a main method for running a FullArchiveRootServer instance. The FullArchiveRootServer is a server that provides access to a full archive of tweets. The purpose of this code is to set up the necessary modules and dependencies for the FullArchiveRootServer to run.

The FullArchiveRootAppMain class contains a nested Main class that provides a main method for running the FullArchiveRootAppMain instance. When the main method is called, it creates a new instance of FullArchiveRootAppMain and calls its main method with the arguments passed to the Main method.

The FullArchiveRootAppMain class overrides three methods from the SearchRootAppMain class: getAdditionalModules, getSearchRootServerClass, and getServiceIfaceClass. The getAdditionalModules method returns a collection of Guice modules that are used to configure the server. The EarlybirdCommonModule and EarlybirdCacheCommonModule provide common functionality for the Earlybird service, while the FullArchiveRootModule provides functionality specific to the FullArchiveRootServer. The QuotaModule provides functionality for rate limiting requests to the server.

The getSearchRootServerClass method returns the class of the FullArchiveRootServer, which is used to instantiate the server. The getServiceIfaceClass method returns the class of the Thrift service interface, which is used to generate the server's Thrift service implementation.

Overall, this code sets up the necessary modules and dependencies for the FullArchiveRootServer to run and provides a main method for running the server. It is likely that this code is part of a larger project that provides access to Twitter's full archive of tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is defining a Java class called `FullArchiveRootAppMain` that extends `SearchRootAppMain` and provides implementations for several methods. It also includes a nested class called `Main` with a `main` method that creates an instance of `FullArchiveRootAppMain` and calls its `main` method with the provided arguments. The purpose of this code is not clear without additional context, but it appears to be related to a search application and may be responsible for starting a server or service.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code imports several classes and interfaces from external libraries, including `java.util.Arrays`, `java.util.Collection`, `com.google.inject.Module`, `com.twitter.search.common.root.SearchRootAppMain`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift.EarlybirdService`. It also instantiates several objects from custom modules, including `EarlybirdCommonModule`, `EarlybirdCacheCommonModule`, `FullArchiveRootModule`, and `QuotaModule`. The specific versions and configurations of these dependencies are not specified in this code.

3. What is the relationship between `FullArchiveRootAppMain` and `FullArchiveRootServer`?
   - `FullArchiveRootAppMain` extends `SearchRootAppMain` and provides an implementation for the `getSearchRootServerClass` method that returns `FullArchiveRootServer.class`. This suggests that `FullArchiveRootAppMain` is responsible for starting or managing an instance of `FullArchiveRootServer`, but the details of this relationship are not clear without additional context.
