The `RealtimeCgRootAppModule` class is a module that provides bindings for various caches and services used in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. The purpose of this module is to provide a set of caches that can be used to store and retrieve search results for the `Earlybird` search service. 

The module provides bindings for several caches, including the `RecencyCache`, `RelevanceCache`, `FacetsCache`, `TermStatsCache`, and `TopTweetsCache`. Each of these caches is created using the `EarlybirdCacheCommonModule.createCache` method, which takes a `JavaClient` instance, a `DefaultForcedCacheMissDecider` instance, and several other parameters. These caches are used to store search results for different types of search queries, such as queries for recent tweets (`RecencyCache`) or queries for tweets that are relevant to a particular topic (`RelevanceCache`). 

The module also provides bindings for several other services, including the `EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport`, `RealtimeCgRootService`, `SearchRootWarmup`, `LoggingSupport`, `PartitionLoggingSupport`, and `ValidationBehavior`. These services are used to support the `Earlybird` search service and provide functionality such as logging, validation, and warmup. 

Overall, the `RealtimeCgRootAppModule` class is an important module in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project, as it provides the caching infrastructure that is used to store and retrieve search results for the `Earlybird` search service. By providing bindings for several different types of caches, this module enables the `Earlybird` search service to efficiently store and retrieve search results for a wide range of search queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code is a module for the RealtimeCgRootApp which provides caching for Earlybird requests. It creates caches for different types of requests and provides warmup, logging, and validation support.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code has dependencies on several libraries including Guice, Finagle, and Twitter common utilities. It also depends on other classes and modules within the Earlybird project.

3. What is the cache eviction policy for each of the caches created in this module?
   
   The eviction policy for each cache is time-based. The recency, relevance, and strict recency caches have a TTL of 20 seconds, while the facets and term stats caches have a TTL of 5 minutes. The top tweets cache has a custom cache age of an unspecified duration.
