The code defines a class called EarlybirdRealtimeScatterGatherSupport that extends another class called EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport. This class is used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the realtime cluster. 

The class takes two parameters in its constructor: PartitionMappingManager and EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger. These parameters are injected using the @Inject annotation. 

The purpose of this class is to provide support for scatter-gather operations in the Earlybird service. Scatter-gather is a technique used to parallelize processing of large datasets. In this case, the scatter-gather operation is used to distribute requests to the earlybird partitions in the realtime cluster. 

The class uses the PartitionMappingManager to determine which partitions to send requests to. The EarlybirdCluster.REALTIME parameter specifies that the requests should be sent to the realtime cluster. The EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger is used to merge the feature schema of the partitions. 

This class is likely used in the larger Earlybird project to provide support for real-time search queries. The scatter-gather technique allows for faster processing of search queries by distributing the workload across multiple partitions. 

Example usage of this class might look like:

```
PartitionMappingManager partitionMappingManager = new PartitionMappingManager();
EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger featureSchemaMerger = new EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger();
EarlybirdRealtimeScatterGatherSupport scatterGatherSupport = new EarlybirdRealtimeScatterGatherSupport(partitionMappingManager, featureSchemaMerger);
// use scatterGatherSupport to fan out search requests to the earlybird partitions in the realtime cluster
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is an implementation of EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport used to fan out requests to the earlybird partitions in the realtime cluster.

2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?
   - This code requires the javax.inject and com.twitter.search.common packages to be imported.

3. What is the significance of the EarlybirdCluster enum?
   - The EarlybirdCluster enum is used to specify the cluster type (in this case, REALTIME) for the EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport implementation.
