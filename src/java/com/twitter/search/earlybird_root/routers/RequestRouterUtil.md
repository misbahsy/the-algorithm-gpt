The `RequestRouterUtil` class contains a static method `checkMinSearchedStatusId()` that returns a function which checks if the `minSearchedStatusID` on the merged response is higher than the `max ID` in the request. This function takes in several parameters including the `requestContext`, `operator`, `requestMaxId`, `realtimeResponseFuture`, `protectedResponseFuture`, `fullArchiveResponseFuture`, and `stat`. 

The purpose of this function is to ensure that the `minSearchedStatusID` on the merged response is not greater than the `max ID` specified in the request. If it is, then the `stat` is incremented and a warning message is logged. This function is used to ensure that the search results returned are relevant and up-to-date. 

For example, if a user searches for tweets with a `max ID` of 1000, but the `minSearchedStatusID` on the merged response is 1100, then the search results are not relevant to the user's query. The `stat` is incremented to keep track of how often this occurs, and a warning message is logged to alert developers to investigate the issue. 

Overall, this function is an important part of the search algorithm used by Twitter to ensure that search results are relevant and up-to-date.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a function that checks if the minSearchedStatusID on the merged response is higher than the max ID in the request.

2. What are the parameters of the checkMinSearchedStatusId function?
- The parameters are the request context, operator, requestMaxId, realtimeResponseFuture, protectedResponseFuture, fullArchiveResponseFuture, and stat.

3. What is the purpose of the LOG.warn statement in the checkMinSearchedStatusId function?
- The LOG.warn statement is used to log a warning message if the minSearchedStatusID on the merged response is larger than the max ID in the request, but only for STRICT RECENCY requests.
