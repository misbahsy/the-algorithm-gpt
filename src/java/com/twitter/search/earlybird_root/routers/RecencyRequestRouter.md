The `RecencyRequestRouter` class is a router that routes search requests to the appropriate service based on the search ranking mode. It extends the `AbstractRecencyAndRelevanceRequestRouter` class and overrides its `shouldSendRequestToFullArchiveCluster` method. 

The class has several instance variables that are injected via the constructor. These include three `Service` objects that represent the real-time, protected real-time, and full archive search services. It also has three `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` objects that represent the time range filters for each of the three services. Additionally, it has a `Clock` object, a `SearchDecider` object, and an `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` object.

The `shouldSendRequestToFullArchiveCluster` method determines whether a search request should be sent to the full archive search service. It takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and an `EarlybirdResponse` object as input parameters. The `EarlybirdResponse` object represents the response from the real-time search service. 

The method first checks whether the real-time search was early terminated. If it was, the method increments a counter and returns `false`, indicating that the request should not be sent to the full archive search service. If the real-time search was not early terminated, the method checks whether the number of results returned by the real-time search is greater than or equal to the number of results requested in the original search query. If it is, the method increments a counter and returns `false`. Otherwise, the method returns `true`, indicating that the request should be sent to the full archive search service.

Overall, this class plays an important role in routing search requests to the appropriate service based on the search ranking mode. It ensures that requests are handled efficiently and effectively by determining whether a request should be sent to the full archive search service or not.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a router for handling recency-based search requests in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the Earlybird search system, including `EarlybirdRequestContext`, `EarlybirdResponse`, `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter`, `SearchDecider`, and `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger`.

3. What is the logic behind the `shouldSendRequestToFullArchiveCluster` method?
- This method determines whether a search request should be sent to the full archive cluster based on whether the real-time search results were early-terminated or if they already contain enough results to fulfill the original request. If either of these conditions are true, the request is not sent to the full archive cluster.
