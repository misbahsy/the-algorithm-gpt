The FacetsRequestRouterModule class is a module that provides a time range filter for search results in the Twitter search service. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to filter search results based on a specific time range. This module is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is a search engine that allows users to search for tweets based on various criteria.

The module uses the Google Guice dependency injection framework to provide the time range filter. The filter is implemented as an EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter object, which is created using the providesTimeRangeFilter method. This method takes a SearchDecider object as a parameter, which is used to determine the time range for the filter.

The time range filter is named TIME_RANGE_FILTER and is annotated with the @Named annotation. This allows the filter to be injected into other classes using the @Inject annotation and the name of the filter. For example, the filter could be injected into a search controller class like this:

```
@Inject
@Named(FacetsRequestRouterModule.TIME_RANGE_FILTER)
private EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter timeRangeFilter;
```

The getServingRangeProvider method is used to create a RealtimeServingRangeProvider object, which is used to determine the time range for the filter. The RealtimeServingRangeProvider object takes a SearchDecider object and a key as parameters. The key is used to retrieve the time range boundary from a configuration file.

Overall, the FacetsRequestRouterModule class provides a way to filter search results based on a specific time range. This module is used in the larger Twitter search service to provide a more refined search experience for users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a module for a Twitter search service that provides a time range filter for search results.

2. What is the significance of the `@Provides` and `@Singleton` annotations?
    
    The `@Provides` annotation indicates that the method provides a dependency that can be injected into other classes. The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the provided dependency will be created and shared across all classes that use it.

3. What is the `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class and how does it work?
    
    The `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class is a filter that restricts search results to a specific time range. It uses a `ServingRangeProvider` to determine the time range based on a `SearchDecider`, which is a component that decides whether a search query should be served in real-time or from a cache.
