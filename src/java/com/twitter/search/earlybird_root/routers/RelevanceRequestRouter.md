The `RelevanceRequestRouter` class is a router that routes search requests to the appropriate service based on the relevance of the search results. It extends the `AbstractRecencyAndRelevanceRequestRouter` class and overrides the `shouldSendRequestToFullArchiveCluster` method to determine whether a search request should be sent to the full archive cluster or not.

The class takes in several parameters through dependency injection, including three services for handling real-time, protected, and full archive search requests, three time range filters for filtering search results based on time, a clock for keeping track of time, a search decider for deciding whether to send a request to the full archive cluster or not, and a feature schema merger for merging feature schemas.

The `shouldSendRequestToFullArchiveCluster` method checks whether the number of hits processed in the real-time cluster is less than the number of results requested. If so, it sends the query to the full archive cluster. If not, it checks whether the number of hits processed is greater than or equal to the maximum number of hits to process multiplied by the number of successful partitions. If so, it does not send the query to the full archive cluster. Otherwise, it checks whether there is a gap between the last result and the minimum status ID of the current search. If the difference is larger than one day, it does not send the query to the full archive cluster.

This class is used in the larger project to route search requests to the appropriate service based on the relevance of the search results. It is part of a larger system for handling search requests and returning relevant results to users. An example of how this class might be used in the larger project is shown below:

```
RelevanceRequestRouter router = new RelevanceRequestRouter(realtimeService, protectedService, fullArchiveService, realtimeTimeRangeFilter, protectedTimeRangeFilter, fullArchiveTimeRangeFilter, clock, decider, featureSchemaMerger);
EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest(searchQuery);
EarlybirdResponse response = router.apply(request);
```

In this example, a `RelevanceRequestRouter` object is created with the appropriate services, time range filters, clock, search decider, and feature schema merger. A new `EarlybirdRequest` object is created with a search query. The `apply` method of the `RelevanceRequestRouter` object is then called with the `EarlybirdRequest` object as a parameter, which returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object containing the search results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class that implements a router for handling relevance-based search requests in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.

2. What dependencies are being used in this code?
- This code uses several dependencies, including Google Guava, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Common.

3. What is the logic behind deciding whether to send a search request to the full archive cluster?
- The code checks whether the number of hits processed in the realtime cluster is less than the number of results requested. If so, the query is sent to the full archive cluster. Otherwise, the code checks if there is a gap between the last result and the minimum status ID of the current search. If the difference is larger than one day, the query is not sent to the full archive cluster yet.
