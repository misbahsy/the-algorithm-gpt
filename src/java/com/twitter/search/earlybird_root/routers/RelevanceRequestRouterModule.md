The `RelevanceRequestRouterModule` class is a module that provides three different time range filters for Twitter search requests. These filters are used to limit the search results to a specific time range. The three filters are `FULL_ARCHIVE_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`, `REALTIME_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`, and `PROTECTED_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`. 

The module uses the `TwitterModule` class from the `com.twitter.inject` package to provide the filters as singletons. The `@Provides` annotation is used to indicate that the methods that return the filters are providers. The `@Singleton` annotation is used to ensure that only one instance of each filter is created and shared across the application.

Each filter is implemented as an instance of the `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class from the `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.filters` package. The `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class is a filter that limits search results to a specific time range. The `newTimeRangeFilterWithoutQueryRewriter` method is used to create a new instance of the filter without a query rewriter. 

Each filter is associated with a `ServingRangeProvider` instance that provides the time range for the filter. The `getFullArchiveServingRangeProvider`, `getRealtimeServingRangeProvider`, and `getProtectedServingRangeProvider` methods are used to create instances of the `FullArchiveServingRangeProvider`, `RealtimeServingRangeProvider`, and `RealtimeServingRangeProvider` classes respectively. These classes implement the `ServingRangeProvider` interface and provide the time range for the corresponding filter.

The `SearchDecider` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.decider` package is used to decide whether a search request should be served by the full archive or the real-time index. The `REALTIME_SERVING_RANGE_BOUNDARY_HOURS_AGO_DECIDER_KEY`, `FULL_ARCHIVE_SERVING_RANGE_BOUNDARY_HOURS_AGO_DECIDER_KEY`, and `PROTECTED_SERVING_RANGE_BOUNDARY_HOURS_AGO_DECIDER_KEY` constants are used as keys to retrieve the serving range boundary hours ago from the `SearchDecider` instance.

Overall, this module provides three different time range filters that can be used to limit search results to a specific time range. These filters are implemented as instances of the `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class and are associated with a `ServingRangeProvider` instance that provides the time range for the filter. The `SearchDecider` class is used to decide whether a search request should be served by the full archive or the real-time index.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a TwitterModule for the RelevanceRequestRouterModule, which provides three EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter objects for full archive, realtime, and protected time ranges.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on several classes and interfaces from the com.twitter.search and com.twitter.inject packages, as well as the javax.inject package.

3. What is the purpose of the getFullArchiveServingRangeProvider, getRealtimeServingRangeProvider, and getProtectedServingRangeProvider methods?
    
    These methods return instances of FullArchiveServingRangeProvider, RealtimeServingRangeProvider, and RealtimeServingRangeProvider, respectively, which are used to provide serving ranges for the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter objects.
