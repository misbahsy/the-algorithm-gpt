The `RequestRouter` class is responsible for handling requests in superroot. It contains three inner classes and three methods. The `RequestResponse` class is used to save request and response to be included in debug info. The `route` method is an abstract method that is used to forward a request to different clusters and merge the responses back into one response. The `saveRequestResponse` method is used to save a request (and its response future) to be included in debug info. The `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse. The `attachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse.

The `RequestRouter` class is used in the larger project to handle requests in superroot. It is an abstract class, which means that it cannot be instantiated. Instead, subclasses of `RequestRouter` are created to handle specific types of requests. These subclasses implement the `route` method to forward requests to different clusters and merge the responses back into one response. The `RequestRouter` class provides methods to save requests and their responses to be included in debug info. The `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse. The `attachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse.

Example usage:

```java
// create a subclass of RequestRouter to handle a specific type of request
public class MyRequestRouter extends RequestRouter {
  @Override
  public Future<EarlybirdResponse> route(EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext) {
    // forward request to different clusters and merge responses back into one response
    // return merged response
  }
}

// create an instance of MyRequestRouter
MyRequestRouter router = new MyRequestRouter();

// handle a request
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();
Future<EarlybirdResponse> response = router.route(requestContext);

// attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse
List<RequestResponse> requestResponses = new ArrayList<>();
router.saveRequestResponse(requestResponses, "realtime", requestContext, response);
response = router.maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo(requestResponses, requestContext, response);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an abstract class `RequestRouter` responsible for handling requests in superroot, and contains methods for forwarding requests to different clusters and merging the responses back into one response.

2. What is the purpose of the `saveRequestResponse` method?
- The `saveRequestResponse` method saves a request (and its response future) to be included in debug info.

3. What is the purpose of the `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method?
- The `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method checks if the request's debug mode is greater than or equal to 4, and if so, calls the `attachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse.
