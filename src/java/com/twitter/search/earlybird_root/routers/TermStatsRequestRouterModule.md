The `TermStatsRequestRouterModule` class is a module that provides two time range filters for the Term Stats service in the Twitter search system. The purpose of this module is to provide two different time ranges for the Term Stats service to search for tweets. 

The first filter is the `FULL_ARCHIVE_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`, which provides a time range from March 21, 2006, to six days ago from the current time. This filter is used to search for tweets in the full archive of Twitter. The second filter is the `REALTIME_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`, which provides a time range from six days ago from the current time to a far away date into the future. This filter is used to search for tweets in real-time.

The module uses two different providers to create the two filters. The `getFullArchiveTimeRangeProvider` method creates a `FullArchiveServingRangeProvider` object that provides the time range for the full archive search. The `getRealtimeTimeRangeProvider` method creates a `RealtimeServingRangeProvider` object that provides the time range for the real-time search.

The module uses the `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class to create the time range filters. The `providesFullArchiveTimeRangeFilter` method creates a `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` object using the `getFullArchiveTimeRangeProvider` method and the `SearchDecider` object. The `providesRealtimeTimeRangeFilter` method creates a `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` object using the `getRealtimeTimeRangeProvider` method and the `SearchDecider` object.

Overall, this module provides two time range filters that can be used by the Term Stats service to search for tweets in the full archive or in real-time. The module uses the `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class to create the filters and the `FullArchiveServingRangeProvider` and `RealtimeServingRangeProvider` classes to provide the time ranges for the filters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a module for the TermStatsRequestRouter in the Earlybird search system, which provides time range filters for term statistics queries.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several classes from the com.twitter.search and com.twitter.inject packages, as well as the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter, FullArchiveServingRangeProvider, RealtimeServingRangeProvider, and SearchDecider classes.

3. What is the difference between the FULL_ARCHIVE_TIME_RANGE_FILTER and REALTIME_TIME_RANGE_FILTER?
- The FULL_ARCHIVE_TIME_RANGE_FILTER provides a time range filter for term statistics queries on the full archive cluster, which spans from March 21, 2006 to 6 days ago from the current time. The REALTIME_TIME_RANGE_FILTER provides a time range filter for term statistics queries on the realtime cluster, which spans from 6 days ago from the current time to a far away date in the future.
