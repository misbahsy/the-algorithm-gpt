The `TopTweetsRequestRouter` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for routing requests for top tweets to the realtime cluster. 

The class extends the `RequestRouter` class and overrides its `route` method. The `route` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object as input and returns a `Future` of `EarlybirdResponse`. The `EarlybirdRequestContext` object contains information about the request, such as the query and the time range. The `Future` of `EarlybirdResponse` represents the response that will be returned to the client.

The `TopTweetsRequestRouter` class has a constructor that takes two arguments: a `Service` of `EarlybirdRequestContext` and `EarlybirdResponse` for the realtime cluster, and an `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter`. The `Service` is annotated with `@Named(InjectionNames.REALTIME)`, which means that it is injected by name. The `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` is also injected by name, using the `TopTweetsRequestRouterModule.TIME_RANGE_FILTER` constant.

In the constructor, the `realtime` field is initialized with the `timeRangeFilter` and `realtime` service. The `timeRangeFilter` is applied first, and then the `realtime` service is applied to the result. This means that the `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` is applied to the request before it is sent to the realtime cluster.

The `TopTweetsRequestRouter` class is used by the SuperRoot to route requests for top tweets to the realtime cluster. The `route` method is called by the SuperRoot when a request for top tweets is received. The `route` method applies the `realtime` service to the `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns the resulting `Future` of `EarlybirdResponse`.

Example usage:

```
Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> realtime = new RealtimeService();
EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter timeRangeFilter = new EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter();
TopTweetsRequestRouter router = new TopTweetsRequestRouter(realtime, timeRangeFilter);

EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext("query", "timeRange");
Future<EarlybirdResponse> responseFuture = router.route(requestContext);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Java class that represents a request router for the TopTweets traffic in the Earlybird search service from Twitter. It forwards all traffic to the realtime cluster.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the Earlybird search service, including EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse, EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter, and RequestRouter. It also uses the Finagle library for network communication.
3. How is the TopTweetsRequestRouter instance created and configured?
   - The TopTweetsRequestRouter instance is created using dependency injection, with the realtime Service and EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter being injected via their respective @Named annotations. The timeRangeFilter is then composed with the realtime Service using the andThen method to create the final Service that is used to handle requests.
