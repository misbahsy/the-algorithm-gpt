The `RecencyRequestRouterModule` class is a module that provides three different time range filters for Twitter search requests. These filters are used to limit search results to a specific time range. The three filters provided are `FULL_ARCHIVE_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`, `REALTIME_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`, and `PROTECTED_TIME_RANGE_FILTER`. 

The module uses the `TwitterModule` class to provide these filters as singletons. Each filter is created using a `SearchDecider` object and a `ServingRangeProvider` object. The `ServingRangeProvider` objects are created using the `FullArchiveServingRangeProvider`, `RealtimeServingRangeProvider`, and `ProtectedServingRangeProvider` classes respectively. These classes are responsible for determining the time range for each filter based on the `SearchDecider` object passed to them.

The `RecencyRequestRouterModule` class also defines several constants that are used to configure the `ServingRangeProvider` objects. These constants are used to specify the number of hours ago that the serving range boundary should be set to for each filter.

The `Provides` annotation is used to define methods that create instances of each filter. These methods are annotated with `@Named` to specify the name of the filter. Each method takes a `SearchDecider` object as a parameter and returns an instance of `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter`. The `EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter` class is responsible for applying the time range filter to search requests.

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to configure and use time range filters for Twitter search requests. Developers can use these filters to limit search results to a specific time range, which can be useful for analyzing trends or monitoring events in real-time. Here is an example of how to use the `FULL_ARCHIVE_TIME_RANGE_FILTER` filter:

```
SearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();
EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter filter = new RecencyRequestRouterModule().providesFullArchiveTimeRangeFilter(decider);
// Use the filter to limit search results to the past 7 days
filter.setTimeRange(7, TimeUnit.DAYS);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a TwitterModule for the RecencyRequestRouterModule, which provides EarlybirdTimeRangeFilters for full archive, realtime, and protected time ranges.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on several classes and interfaces from the com.twitter.search and com.twitter.inject packages, as well as the javax.inject package.

3. What is the role of the SearchDecider interface in this code?
    
    The SearchDecider interface is used to create instances of the FullArchiveServingRangeProvider, RealtimeServingRangeProvider, and ProtectedServingRangeProvider classes, which are then used to create the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilters provided by this module.
