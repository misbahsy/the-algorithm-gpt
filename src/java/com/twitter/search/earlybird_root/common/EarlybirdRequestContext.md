The `EarlybirdRequestContext` class is a wrapper around an `EarlybirdRequest` object, which contains additional data that should be passed to services. This class is immutable and thread-safe, and it is used to create new contexts with the provided request and additional data.

The class has several static methods that create new contexts with different parameters. The `newContext` method creates a new context with the provided `EarlybirdRequest`, `SearchDecider`, `Viewer`, and `Clock`. It captures the created time as early as possible and returns a new `EarlybirdRequestContext` object.

The `newContextWithRestrictFromUserIdFilter64` method creates a new context with the intersection of the `userID` and the `flock` response, which is set in the `followedUserIds` field. This is used for the protected cluster.

The `copyRequestContext` method makes an exact copy of the provided request context by cloning the underlying `EarlybirdRequest`.

The `newContext` method creates a new context with the provided request, context, and resets both the feature schemas cached in the client and the feature schemas cached in the local cache.

The `deepCopy` method creates a new `EarlybirdRequestContext` object with a deep copy of the `request` object, `parsedQuery`, `useOverrideTierConfig`, `createdTimeMillis`, and `twitterContextViewer`.

The class has several private fields, including `request`, `earlybirdRequestType`, `parsedQuery`, `useOverrideTierConfig`, `createdTimeMillis`, `twitterContextViewer`, and `featureSchemasAvailableInClient`. These fields are used to store the data that is passed to services.

Overall, the `EarlybirdRequestContext` class is an important part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project, as it provides a way to pass additional data to services and create new contexts with different parameters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdRequestContext class?
- The EarlybirdRequestContext class is a wrapper for a request and additional per-request data that should be passed to services.

2. What is the significance of the useOverrideTierConfig variable?
- The useOverrideTierConfig variable is used to determine whether to use override tier configurations or not.

3. What is the purpose of the newContextWithRestrictFromUserIdFilter64 method?
- The newContextWithRestrictFromUserIdFilter64 method is used to create a new EarlybirdRequestContext with an intersection of the userID and the flock response, which is set in the followedUserIds field. This is used for protected cluster.
