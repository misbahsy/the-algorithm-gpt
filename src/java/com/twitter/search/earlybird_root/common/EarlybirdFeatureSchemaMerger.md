The `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` class is responsible for managing and merging feature schemas in the context of search results from Twitter's search engine, Earlybird. It is designed to be thread-safe and is used in the larger project to handle search requests and responses that involve feature schemas.

The class maintains a cache of feature schemas (`featureSchemas`) and a collection of statistics (`mergeStats`) related to schema merging. It provides methods to get the list of available schemas, collect and set feature schemas in search results, and merge feature schemas across search clusters.

The `collectAndSetFeatureSchemaInResponse` method is used to iterate through all the responses, collect and cache feature schemas from the response, and set the feature schema for the response in `searchResults`. This is done inside Earlybird roots.

The `mergeFeatureSchemaAcrossClusters` method is responsible for merging feature schemas from each cluster's response and returning it to the client. This is done inside the superroot.

The class also provides private helper methods to add new schemas to the cache, update the returned schema based on the Earlybird response from the search cluster, find the most occurred schema, and get or create merge statistics.

For example, when a search request is made, the `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` class can be used to collect and set the appropriate feature schema in the search results. It can also merge feature schemas from different search clusters to provide a unified schema for the client.

```java
EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger schemaMerger = new EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger();
schemaMerger.collectAndSetFeatureSchemaInResponse(searchResults, requestContext, statPrefix, successfulResponses);
schemaMerger.mergeFeatureSchemaAcrossClusters(requestContext, mergedResponse, statsPrefix, realtimeResponse, protectedResponse, fullArchiveResponse);
```

Overall, the `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` class plays a crucial role in handling feature schemas in the context of search results, ensuring that the appropriate schema is used and merged across different search clusters.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` class?
   **Answer**: The `EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger` class is responsible for merging feature schemas from different search clusters, caching them, and setting the appropriate feature schema in the search results based on the client's request and available schemas.

2. **Question**: How does the `collectAndSetFeatureSchemaInResponse` method work?
   **Answer**: The `collectAndSetFeatureSchemaInResponse` method iterates through all the responses, collects and caches feature schemas from the responses, and sets the feature schema for the response in `searchResults` if needed. It takes into account the client's request and the available schemas in the client.

3. **Question**: How does the `mergeFeatureSchemaAcrossClusters` method work?
   **Answer**: The `mergeFeatureSchemaAcrossClusters` method merges the feature schema from each cluster's response and returns it to the client. It takes into account the search request context, merged response, and responses from different search clusters (realtime, protected, and full archive). It updates the returned schema based on the available schemas in the client and the earlybird responses from the search clusters.
