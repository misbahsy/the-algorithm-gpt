The `EarlybirdRequestType` class is an enum that represents the different types of requests that can be made to the Earlybird search system. The purpose of this class is to distinguish between different types of requests and treat them differently. 

The enum contains six different request types: `FACETS`, `RECENCY`, `RELEVANCE`, `STRICT_RECENCY`, `TERM_STATS`, and `TOP_TWEETS`. Each of these types corresponds to a different type of search query that can be made to the Earlybird system. 

The `of` method is a static method that takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object as input and returns the corresponding `EarlybirdRequestType`. This method checks the type of the input request and returns the appropriate `EarlybirdRequestType` enum value. If the request is a facet request, it returns `FACETS`. If the request is a term statistics request, it returns `TERM_STATS`. If the request is a search query, it checks the ranking mode of the query and returns the appropriate `EarlybirdRequestType` enum value. If the ranking mode is `RECENCY`, it checks whether strict recency should be used and returns either `STRICT_RECENCY` or `RECENCY`. If the ranking mode is `RELEVANCE`, it returns `RELEVANCE`. If the ranking mode is `TOPTWEETS`, it returns `TOP_TWEETS`. If the input request is not one of these types, it throws an exception.

The `shouldUseStrictRecency` method is a private helper method that takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether strict recency should be used for the request. For now, this method simply checks whether the query source is set to `GNIP` and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.

The `normalizedName` field is a private field that stores the normalized name of the request type. The `EarlybirdRequestType` constructor initializes this field to the lowercase name of the enum value.

The `getNormalizedName` method is a public method that returns the normalized name of the request type. This method can be used for stat and decider names.

Overall, the `EarlybirdRequestType` class is an important part of the Earlybird search system that helps to distinguish between different types of search requests and treat them appropriately. Developers can use this class to determine the type of a given search request and handle it accordingly. For example, if a search request is a facet request, the system can return facet data to the user. If a search request is a recency query, the system can return the most recent tweets that match the query.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an enum called EarlybirdRequestType that distinguishes different types of requests for the Earlybird search system.

2. What is the significance of the getNormalizedName() method?
- The getNormalizedName() method returns a "normalized" name for the request type that can be used for statistical and decision-making purposes.

3. What is the purpose of the shouldUseStrictRecency() method?
- The shouldUseStrictRecency() method determines whether strict recency should be used for a given request based on the query source. Currently, strict recency is only used for GNIP queries.
