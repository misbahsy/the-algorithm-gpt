The `EarlybirdServiceResponse` class is a wrapper around an `EarlybirdResponse` object and a flag that indicates whether a request was sent to a service. The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way of representing the state of a service call and its response. 

The `ServiceState` enum defines four possible states of a service call: `SERVICE_CALLED`, `SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE`, `SERVICE_NOT_REQUESTED`, and `SERVICE_NOT_CALLED`. The `SERVICE_CALLED` state indicates that the service was called or will be called, `SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE` indicates that the service is not available, `SERVICE_NOT_REQUESTED` indicates that the client did not request results from this service, and `SERVICE_NOT_CALLED` indicates that the service is available and the client wants results from this service, but the service was not called (because we got enough results from other services, for example).

The `EarlybirdServiceResponse` constructor takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object and a `ServiceState` object as arguments. It checks that the `ServiceState` object is consistent with the `EarlybirdResponse` object. If the `ServiceState` object indicates that the service was not called, the `EarlybirdResponse` object must be null. 

The class provides two static factory methods for creating `EarlybirdServiceResponse` objects. The `serviceNotCalled` method creates an object that indicates that the service was not called. The `serviceCalled` method creates an object that wraps an `EarlybirdResponse` object and indicates that the service was called. 

The `getResponse` method returns the wrapped `EarlybirdResponse` object, or null if the service was not called. The `getServiceState` method returns the `ServiceState` object that represents the state of the service call. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to provide a consistent way of representing the state of a service call and its response. It may be used by other classes that make service calls to return a standardized response object. For example, a class that makes a service call might return an `EarlybirdServiceResponse` object to indicate the state of the call and its response. Other classes that receive this object can then use the `getResponse` and `getServiceState` methods to access the response and state information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EarlybirdServiceResponse` class?
- The `EarlybirdServiceResponse` class is a wrapper class that contains an `EarlybirdResponse` and a flag that determines if a request was sent to a service.

2. What is the purpose of the `ServiceState` enum?
- The `ServiceState` enum is used to represent the state of the service, including whether the service was called, not available, not requested, or not called.

3. What are the restrictions on creating a new `EarlybirdServiceResponse` instance?
- If the `ServiceState` indicates that the service was not called, the `EarlybirdResponse` instance must be null, and an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown if it is not.
