The EarlybirdServicePartitionLoggingSupport class is responsible for logging partition latencies for the Earlybird search service. This class extends the DefaultPartitionLoggingSupport class and overrides its logPartitionLatencies method. 

The logPartitionLatencies method takes in an EarlybirdRequestContext object, a tierName string, a Map of partitionLatenciesMicros, and a latencyMs long. It first initializes a logReason string to null. Then, it checks if a random float generated by the random object is less than or equal to the FRACTION_OF_REQUESTS_TO_LOG constant. If it is, the logReason is set to "randomSample". If not, it checks if the latencyMs is greater than the LATENCY_LOG_PARTITIONS_THRESHOLD_MS constant. If it is, the logReason is set to "slow". 

If the logReason is not null and the EarlybirdRequest object in the EarlybirdRequestContext object has a search query set, the partition latencies are logged using the PARTITION_LOG logger. The logger logs the tierName, logReason, latencyMs, partitionLatenciesMicros, clientRequestID, and serializedQuery. 

This class is used in the Earlybird search service to log partition latencies for requests. By logging partition latencies, the service can identify slow or problematic partitions and take action to improve performance. 

Example usage:

```
EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(request);
String tierName = "search";
Map<Integer, Long> partitionLatenciesMicros = new HashMap<>();
long latencyMs = 1000;

EarlybirdServicePartitionLoggingSupport loggingSupport = new EarlybirdServicePartitionLoggingSupport();
loggingSupport.logPartitionLatencies(requestContext, tierName, partitionLatenciesMicros, latencyMs);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class that provides partition logging support for the Earlybird service of Twitter's search functionality.

2. What is the significance of the constants `LATENCY_LOG_PARTITIONS_THRESHOLD_MS` and `FRACTION_OF_REQUESTS_TO_LOG`?
- `LATENCY_LOG_PARTITIONS_THRESHOLD_MS` is the minimum latency threshold in milliseconds for logging partition latencies, while `FRACTION_OF_REQUESTS_TO_LOG` is the fraction of requests to log. 
- These constants determine the conditions under which partition latencies are logged.

3. What is the role of the `logPartitionLatencies` method?
- The `logPartitionLatencies` method logs partition latencies for a given request context, tier name, and map of partition latencies. 
- It also determines whether to log the latencies based on the `LATENCY_LOG_PARTITIONS_THRESHOLD_MS` and `FRACTION_OF_REQUESTS_TO_LOG` constants and the request's search query.
