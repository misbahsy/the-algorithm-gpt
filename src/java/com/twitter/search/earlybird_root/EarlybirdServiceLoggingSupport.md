The `EarlybirdServiceLoggingSupport` class is responsible for logging requests and responses for the Earlybird service. It extends the `LoggingSupport.DefaultLoggingSupport` class, which provides default implementations for logging request and response objects. 

The constructor takes a `SearchDecider` object as a parameter, which is used to build the `EarlybirdRequestPreLogger` and `EarlybirdRequestPostLogger` objects. These objects are responsible for logging the request before and after it is processed by the service, respectively. 

The `prelogRequest` method logs the request object before it is processed by the service. It calls the `logRequest` method of the `EarlybirdRequestPreLogger` object to log the request. 

The `postLogRequest` method logs the response object after it is processed by the service. It sets the response time in microseconds and milliseconds using the `setResponseTimeMicros` and `setResponseTime` methods of the `EarlybirdResponse` object. It then calls the `logRequest` method of the `EarlybirdRequestPostLogger` object to log the request and response objects along with a dummy timer object. 

The `logExceptions` method logs any exceptions that occur during the processing of the request. It calls the `logException` method of the `ExceptionHandler` class to log the exception. 

Overall, this class provides logging support for the Earlybird service, which can be used to monitor the performance and diagnose any issues that may occur during the processing of requests. 

Example usage:

```java
SearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();
EarlybirdServiceLoggingSupport loggingSupport = new EarlybirdServiceLoggingSupport(decider);

EarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();
// set request parameters

loggingSupport.prelogRequest(request);

EarlybirdResponse response = processRequest(request);

loggingSupport.postLogRequest(request, response, latencyNanos);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a Java class that provides logging support for the EarlybirdService in the Twitter search system.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    
    This code uses the Guava library for Preconditions and the EarlybirdRequestPreLogger and EarlybirdRequestPostLogger classes from the Earlybird common package.

3. What is the significance of the LATENCY_WARN_THRESHOLD_MS constant?
    
    The LATENCY_WARN_THRESHOLD_MS constant is used to set a threshold for the response time of requests to the EarlybirdService. If the response time exceeds this threshold, a warning will be logged.
