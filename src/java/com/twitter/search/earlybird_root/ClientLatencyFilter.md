The `ClientLatencyFilter` class is a filter that measures the latency of requests to services that the root depends on. It extends the `SimpleFilter` class from the Finagle library and takes in `EarlybirdRequest` and `EarlybirdResponse` objects. 

The purpose of this filter is to measure the time it takes for a request to travel between the root and the service it depends on. This is important because it allows developers to identify if there is a significant difference between the measured latency and the actual latency of the request. 

The filter uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` to store `RequestCounters` objects for each client. The `RequestCounters` class is a utility class that tracks the number of requests and their latency. The `ClientLatencyFilter` creates a new `RequestCounters` object for each client if one does not already exist. 

The `apply` method is called for each request that passes through the filter. It retrieves the `RequestCounters` object for the client associated with the request and creates a new `RequestCountersEventListener` object. The `RequestCountersEventListener` listens for the completion of the request and updates the `RequestCounters` object with the latency of the request. 

The `ClientLatencyFilter` is used in the larger project to measure the latency of requests to services that the root depends on. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the root and its dependencies. 

Example usage:

```java
ClientLatencyFilter filter = new ClientLatencyFilter("my_prefix");
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> service = ... // create service
Service<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> filteredService = filter.andThen(service);
```

In this example, a new `ClientLatencyFilter` object is created with the prefix "my_prefix". The `andThen` method is used to chain the filter with the service, creating a new `Service` object that includes the filter. This new `Service` object can be used to handle requests and measure their latency.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a filter called `ClientLatencyFilter` that measures the latency of requests to services that the root depends on, and breaks it down by client.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has external dependencies on `com.twitter.common.util.Clock`, `com.twitter.finagle.Service`, `com.twitter.finagle.SimpleFilter`, `com.twitter.search.common.clientstats.RequestCounters`, `com.twitter.search.common.clientstats.RequestCountersEventListener`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird.common.ClientIdUtil`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift.EarlybirdRequest`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift.EarlybirdResponse`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root.filters.EarlybirdSuccessfulResponseHandler`.

3. What is the purpose of the `STAT_FORMAT` string?
    
    The `STAT_FORMAT` string is used to format the name of the request counter for a given client, so that it can be used to measure the latency of requests to services that the root depends on. It includes a prefix and the client ID.
