The `EarlybirdServiceChainBuilder` class is responsible for constructing a chain of services that should be queried on each request. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `buildServiceChain` method is the main method of this class. It takes in a `ScatterGatherSupport` object and a `PartitionLoggingSupport` object and returns a list of `Service` objects. The `ScatterGatherSupport` object is used to build the `ScatterGatherService` object for each tier. The `PartitionLoggingSupport` object is used to log partition information for each request. 

The `EarlybirdServiceChainBuilder` class uses several other classes and interfaces to build the service chain. These include `EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders`, `RequestContextToEarlybirdRequestFilter`, `SearchDecider`, `TierInfoSource`, `RootClientServiceBuilder`, `PartitionAccessController`, and `StatsReceiver`. 

The `createTierService` method is used to create a `Service` object for each tier. It takes in the `ScatterGatherSupport` object, the `TierInfo` object for the tier, the `RootClientServiceBuilder` object, and the `PartitionLoggingSupport` object. It returns a `Service` object that includes a `ScatterGatherService` object for the tier, as well as several filters that are applied to the request before it is sent to the backend service. These filters include a tier throttle filter, a time range filter, a backup filter, and a latency filter. 

The `getTierThrottleFilter` method is used to create the tier throttle filter. This filter is responsible for throttling the request rate for each tier. It uses the `TierInfo` object for the tier to determine the read type for the request (dark, grey, or light). It also uses the `TierInfoWrapper` object to override the tier configuration for the request if necessary. 

Overall, the `EarlybirdServiceChainBuilder` class is an important part of the Earlybird search system. It is responsible for constructing the service chain that is used to handle search requests. It uses several other classes and interfaces to build the service chain, including the `ScatterGatherSupport` object, the `PartitionLoggingSupport` object, and the `TierInfo` object for each tier.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for constructing a ScatterGatherServiceChain for the Earlybird search service, by loading configurations from earlybird-tiers.yml.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as Guava, SLF4J, and Twitter Finagle.

3. What is the role of the EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders class?
- The EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders class is used to determine whether a request should be sent to a particular tier based on the throttle decider key.
