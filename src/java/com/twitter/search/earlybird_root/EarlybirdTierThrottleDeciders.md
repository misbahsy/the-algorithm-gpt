The `EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders` class is responsible for controlling the fractions of requests that are sent out to each tier in the Twitter search system. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The class is a singleton and has three methods. The first method is the constructor, which takes a `SearchDecider` object as an argument. This object is injected by Guice, a dependency injection framework used in the project. The `SearchDecider` object is used to construct a decider for the specified tier.

The second method, `getTierThrottleDeciderKey`, returns the throttle decider key for the specified tier. The throttle decider key is a string that is used to identify the decider for a particular tier. The method takes two arguments, `clusterName` and `tierName`, which are used to construct the key. If the decider key does not exist, a warning message is logged.

The third method, `shouldSendRequestToTier`, checks whether a request should be sent to the specified tier. The method takes a `tierDarkReadDeciderKey` argument, which is the throttle decider key for the tier. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the tier is available to receive requests.

This class is used in the larger project to control the flow of requests to each tier in the Twitter search system. By controlling the fractions of requests that are sent out to each tier, the system can be optimized for performance and reliability. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the project:

```
EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders throttleDeciders = new EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders(searchDecider);
String deciderKey = throttleDeciders.getTierThrottleDeciderKey("cluster1", "tier1");
if (throttleDeciders.shouldSendRequestToTier(deciderKey)) {
  // send request to tier1
} else {
  // send request to another tier
}
```

In this example, a `throttleDeciders` object is created using a `searchDecider` object that has been injected by Guice. The `getTierThrottleDeciderKey` method is called to get the throttle decider key for `cluster1` and `tier1`. The `shouldSendRequestToTier` method is then called to check whether a request should be sent to `tier1`. If the tier is available, the request is sent to `tier1`. Otherwise, the request is sent to another tier.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code controls fractions of requests that are sent out to each tier.

2. What is the role of Guice in this code?
- Guice is used to inject the singleton decider object into the constructor of EarlybirdTierThrottleDeciders.

3. What is the purpose of the shouldSendRequestToTier method?
- The shouldSendRequestToTier method checks whether a request should be sent to the specified tier by returning a Boolean value based on the availability of the tierDarkReadDeciderKey.
