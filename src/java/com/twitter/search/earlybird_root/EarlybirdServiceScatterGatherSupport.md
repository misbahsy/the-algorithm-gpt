The `EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport` class is a part of the Earlybird search service from Twitter. It provides support for scatter-gather search queries across multiple partitions. The scatter-gather approach is used to distribute the search query across multiple partitions and then gather the results from each partition to form a final result set. 

The class implements the `ScatterGatherSupport` interface, which defines the methods required for scatter-gather search. The `rewriteRequest` method is used to rewrite the search query based on the partition type and the number of partitions. The `fanoutToAllPartitions` method is used to fan out the original request to all partitions. The `populateIdsForPartition` method is used to populate the map of partition IDs and valid IDs for each partition. The `setPerPartitionIds` method is used to set the partition IDs for each request. 

The `merge` method is used to merge the sub-results indexed by the partition ID. The `isSuccess`, `isTimeout`, and `isClientCancel` methods are used to check the response code for success, timeout, and client cancel errors, respectively. The `errorResponse` method is used to return an error response with a debug string. 

The `EarlybirdServiceScatterGatherSupport` class is used in the Earlybird search service to support scatter-gather search queries across multiple partitions. It provides the necessary methods to rewrite the search query, fan out the request to all partitions, and merge the sub-results to form a final result set.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java implementation of the scatter-gather algorithm for the Earlybird search service from Twitter.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Guava, Thrift, and Twitter Util.

3. What is the role of the `merge` method in this code?
- The `merge` method is responsible for merging the sub-results from each partition into a single response for the client. It uses a response merger and a partition response accumulator to accomplish this.
