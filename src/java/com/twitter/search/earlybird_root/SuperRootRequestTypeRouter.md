The `SuperRootRequestTypeRouter` class is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate request router based on the type of the request. This class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is a search engine that allows users to search for tweets based on various criteria.

The class extends the `Service` class, which is a part of the Finagle library from Twitter. The `Service` class is used to define a service that takes a request and returns a response. In this case, the service takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and returns an `EarlybirdResponse` object.

The `SuperRootRequestTypeRouter` class has a constructor that takes five request routers as arguments. These request routers are responsible for handling requests of different types. The `routingMap` field is a map that maps each request type to the appropriate request router. The `routingMap` is created using the `Maps.immutableEnumMap` method from the Guava library, which creates an immutable map that maps each enum value to a corresponding value.

The `apply` method is called when a request is received. The method first checks if the search query is null and throws a `ClientErrorException` if it is. It then gets the request type from the `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and checks if the `routingMap` contains the request type. If the `routingMap` contains the request type, the method gets the appropriate request router from the `routingMap` and calls its `route` method with the `EarlybirdRequestContext` object. If the `routingMap` does not contain the request type, the method throws a `ClientErrorException` with a message that explains how to use the API.

Overall, the `SuperRootRequestTypeRouter` class is an important part of the search engine as it is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate request router based on the type of the request. This allows the search engine to handle different types of requests and provide relevant search results to the users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class that acts as a router for different types of requests in the Earlybird search service from Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the Earlybird search service, as well as classes from the Google Guava library and the Twitter Finagle library.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- This code expects an EarlybirdRequestContext object as input and returns a Future object containing an EarlybirdResponse object as output. The input and output are used to route different types of search requests to the appropriate RequestRouter object.
