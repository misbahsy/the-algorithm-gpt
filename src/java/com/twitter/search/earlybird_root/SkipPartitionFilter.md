The SkipPartitionFilter class is a filter that is used to determine whether a request should be sent to a partition or not. It is a part of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. The purpose of this filter is to return a PARTITION_SKIPPED response instead of sending the request to a partition if the partition is disabled for a request. 

The class takes in three parameters: tierName, partitionNum, and controller. The tierName is the name of the tier that the partition belongs to. The partitionNum is the number of the partition that the filter is being applied to. The controller is an instance of the PartitionAccessController class, which is used to determine whether a partition is enabled or disabled for a request.

The apply() method is the main method of the class. It takes in an EarlybirdRequestContext object and a Service object as parameters. The EarlybirdRequestContext object contains the request that is being processed. The method first checks whether the partition is enabled or disabled for the request by calling the canAccessPartition() method of the controller. If the partition is disabled, the method returns a PARTITION_SKIPPED response. If the partition is enabled, the method calls the apply() method of the Service object to process the request.

The wrapServices() method is a static method that is used to wrap a list of services with SkipPartitionFilter instances. It takes in three parameters: tierName, clients, and controller. The tierName is the name of the tier that the partitions belong to. The clients parameter is a list of Service objects that are being wrapped. The controller parameter is an instance of the PartitionAccessController class. The method creates a SkipPartitionFilter instance for each partition and adds it to a list of wrapped services. It then returns the list of wrapped services.

Overall, the SkipPartitionFilter class is an important part of the Earlybird search system. It is used to ensure that requests are only sent to partitions that are enabled for the request. This helps to improve the performance and reliability of the search system. An example of how this class may be used in the larger project is to wrap a list of services with SkipPartitionFilter instances before sending requests to the partitions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a filter that returns a PARTITION_SKIPPED response instead of sending the request to a partition if the partition is disabled for a request. It is used to wrap services in the project and ensure that requests are only sent to enabled partitions.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries including SLF4J, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Earlybird Thrift.

3. How are the services wrapped with the SkipPartitionFilter?
- The services are wrapped by iterating through a list of clients and creating a SkipPartitionFilter for each partition. The filter is then applied to the corresponding client using the andThen method, and the resulting wrapped service is added to a list of wrapped services.
