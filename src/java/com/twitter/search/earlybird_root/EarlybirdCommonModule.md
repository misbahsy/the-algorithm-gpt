The EarlybirdCommonModule class provides common bindings for the Earlybird search service. It is a module in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this module is to provide common bindings for the Earlybird search service. It contains several methods that provide bindings for various components of the service. For example, it provides a binding for the ZooKeeperProxy, which is used to connect to ZooKeeper. It also provides a binding for the EarlybirdFeatureSchemaMerger, which is used to merge feature schemas. 

One of the key methods in this module is providesByteService(). This method provides a Service that takes in a byte array and returns a byte array. It uses a DarkProxy to filter the request and response, and then passes the request to the EarlybirdService. The EarlybirdService processes the request and returns a response, which is then passed back through the DarkProxy and returned to the client. 

Another important method is provideExpClusterRootClientServiceBuilder(). This method provides a RootClientServiceBuilder that is used to build a client for the EarlybirdService. The client is built using the serverSetsConfig, serviceIface, resolverProxy, and remoteClientBuilder. 

Overall, the EarlybirdCommonModule provides common bindings for the Earlybird search service. It is used in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code provides common bindings for the Earlybird service from Twitter, including configuration for ZooKeeper, service interfaces, and filters for request processing.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code has dependencies on several libraries and modules, including Guice, Finagle, Thrift, and ZooKeeper.

3. What is the significance of the `@Provides` annotation in this code?
   
   The `@Provides` annotation is used to indicate that a method in this module provides a specific type of object that can be injected into other classes. These methods are used to configure and provide instances of various dependencies used by the Earlybird service.
