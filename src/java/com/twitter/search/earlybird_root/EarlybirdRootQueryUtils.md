The `EarlybirdRootQueryUtils` class provides a utility method for rewriting queries based on partition for a USER_ID/TWEET_ID partitioned cluster. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to rewrite queries that contain the `multi_term_disjunction from_user_id` or `multi_term_disjunction id` clauses based on the partition. 

The `rewriteMultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionFilter` method takes in a `Query` object, a `PartitionMappingManager` object, and an integer representing the number of partitions. It returns a `Map` object with the partition ID as the key and the rewritten query as the value. If there is no `multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id` clause in the query, the map will be empty. If all IDs are truncated for a partition, it will add a `NO_MATCH_CONJUNCTION` here.

The method loops through each partition and creates a `MultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionVisitor` object with the `PartitionMappingManager` and partition ID. It then tries to rewrite the query using the visitor's `accept` method. If the query is successfully rewritten, it is added to the map with the partition ID as the key. If there is an error during the rewriting process, the original query is added to the map with the partition ID as the key and an error message is logged.

This utility method can be used in the larger project to improve query performance by rewriting queries based on partition. By doing so, the query can be optimized for each partition, resulting in faster query execution times. 

Example usage:

```
Query query = new Query("multi_term_disjunction from_user_id:1234");
PartitionMappingManager partitionMappingManager = new PartitionMappingManager();
int numPartitions = 4;
Map<Integer, Query> rewrittenQueries = EarlybirdRootQueryUtils.rewriteMultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionFilter(query, partitionMappingManager, numPartitions);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to rewrite a query based on partition for a USER_ID/TWEET_ID partitioned cluster.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the Guava library and the SLF4J logging framework.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `rewriteMultiTermDisjunctionPerPartitionFilter` method?
- The expected input is a `Query` object, a `PartitionMappingManager` object, and an integer representing the number of partitions. The expected output is a map with partition id as key and rewritten query as value. If there is no 'multi_term_disjunction from_user_id/id' in query, the map will be empty; if all ids are truncated for a partition, it will add a NO_MATCH_CONJUNCTION here.
