The `EarlybirdProtectedWarmup` class is a subclass of `EarlybirdWarmup` and is used to create a request for the protected cluster in the Twitter search system. The class takes in a `Clock` object and a `WarmupConfig` object as parameters in its constructor. 

The `createRequest` method is overridden in this class to add two specific parameters to the request object. The protected cluster requires all queries to specify a `fromUserIdFilter` and a `searcherId`. These parameters are added to the request object by calling the `addToFromUserIDFilter64` method and setting the `searcherId` to 0L. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to handle requests to the protected cluster in the Twitter search system. By extending the `EarlybirdWarmup` class, it inherits the functionality to create a request object for the Twitter search system. The `createRequest` method is then overridden to add the specific parameters required by the protected cluster. 

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```
Clock clock = new SystemClock();
WarmupConfig config = new WarmupConfig();
EarlybirdProtectedWarmup warmup = new EarlybirdProtectedWarmup(clock, config);
EarlybirdRequest request = warmup.createRequest(12345);
// use the request object to make a query to the protected cluster
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a subclass of `EarlybirdWarmup` and overrides the `createRequest` method to add specific requirements for the protected cluster, such as specifying a `fromUserIdFilter` and a `searcherId`.

2. What is the relationship between this code and other classes in the project?
    
    This code extends the `EarlybirdWarmup` class and is located in the `com.twitter.search.earlybird_root` package. It also uses classes from other packages such as `com.twitter.common.util.Clock` and `com.twitter.search.common.root.WarmupConfig`.

3. What are the expected inputs and outputs of the `createRequest` method?
    
    The `createRequest` method takes an integer `requestId` as input and returns an `EarlybirdRequest` object. It also modifies the `EarlybirdRequest` object by adding a `fromUserIdFilter` and setting the `searcherId` to 0L.
