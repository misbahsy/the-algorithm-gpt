The `FieldStatExporter` class is responsible for exporting counts of fields that are present on processed tweets. It is used to ensure that important fields are not missing. This class is not thread-safe. 

The `FieldStatExporter` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `statPrefix`, `schema`, and `penguinVersions`. `statPrefix` is a string that is used as a prefix for the names of the exported stats. `schema` is an instance of the `Schema` class that represents the schema of the processed tweets. `penguinVersions` is a list of `PenguinVersion` objects that represent the versions of the processed tweets.

The `FieldStatExporter` class has a method called `addFieldStats` that takes an instance of the `ThriftVersionedEvents` class as a parameter. This method exports stats counting the number of fields that are present on each document. It iterates over the `penguinVersions` list and for each version, it gets the corresponding `ThriftIndexingEvent` object from the `ThriftVersionedEvents` object. It then iterates over the fields of the document and counts the number of times each field appears. If the field is an encoded tweet feature field, it calls the `exportEncodedFeaturesStats` method to count the number of times each feature appears. If the field is a feature field, it calls the `updateCounterForFeatureField` method to count the number of times each feature appears. If the field is not an encoded tweet feature field or a feature field, it increments the corresponding `SearchRateCounter` object.

The `FieldStatExporter` class has three private methods: `isFeatureField`, `getEncodedTweetFeaturesFields`, and `exportEncodedFeaturesStats`. The `isFeatureField` method takes a `ThriftField` object as a parameter and returns true if the field is a feature field. The `getEncodedTweetFeaturesFields` method takes an `EarlybirdFieldConstant` object as a parameter and returns a set of `EarlybirdFieldConstant` objects that represent the fields of the encoded tweet features. The `exportEncodedFeaturesStats` method takes four parameters: `featuresField`, `schemaFeatureFields`, `penguinVersion`, and `thriftField`. It counts the number of times each feature appears in the encoded tweet features and increments the corresponding `SearchRateCounter` object.

The `FieldStatExporter` class has a method called `updatePenguinVersions` that takes a list of `PenguinVersion` objects as a parameter. This method updates the `penguinVersions` field with the new list of versions. 

Overall, the `FieldStatExporter` class is an important part of the larger project as it ensures that important fields are not missing from the processed tweets. It exports stats that can be used to monitor the quality of the processed tweets and to identify any issues that may arise.
