The `TextFeatureExtractionWorkersStage` class is a stage in a data processing pipeline that extracts text features from Twitter messages. It implements the `TwitterBaseStage` class and processes `TwitterMessage` objects. The stage uses a thread pool to parallelize the processing of messages. 

The stage has a queue of `TwitterMessage` objects with a maximum size of 100. When a message is received, it is added to the queue. The thread pool has five threads, each of which runs a `FeatureExtractorWorker` that takes messages from the queue and processes them. The `tryToParse` method of the stage parses the text of the message using a `TweetParser` and merges the parsed features into the message. If parsing fails, the message is not passed to the next stage of the pipeline. 

The stage also has several metrics that are exported using the `SearchRateCounter` and `SearchCustomGauge` classes. These metrics include the number of slow tweets, the size of the message queue, the number of thread errors, and the number of thread interruptions. 

Overall, the purpose of this stage is to extract text features from Twitter messages and pass them to the next stage of the pipeline. The use of a thread pool allows for parallel processing of messages, which can improve the performance of the pipeline. 

Example usage:

```java
TextFeatureExtractionWorkersStage stage = new TextFeatureExtractionWorkersStage();
stage.init();
TwitterMessage message = new TwitterMessage();
message.setText("This is a test tweet.");
stage.process(message);
```
