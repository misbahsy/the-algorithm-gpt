The `FilterTwitterMessageStage` class is a part of the Twitter Search Ingester Pipeline and is responsible for filtering out Twitter messages that do not meet certain criteria. This class extends the `TwitterBaseStage` class and implements the `innerProcess` and `innerRunStageV2` methods to filter the incoming Twitter messages.

The `FilterTwitterMessageStage` class uses the `IngesterValidMessageFilter` class to filter out Twitter messages that do not meet certain criteria. The `tryToFilter` method is used to check if the incoming Twitter message meets the filtering criteria. If the message meets the criteria, it is emitted and counted as a valid message. If the message does not meet the criteria, it is counted as an invalid message.

The `FilterTwitterMessageStage` class also implements the `initStats`, `innerSetupStats`, and `innerSetup` methods to set up the statistics for the filtered messages. The `validMessages` and `invalidMessages` variables are used to count the number of valid and invalid messages respectively.

This class is used in the larger Twitter Search Ingester Pipeline to filter out Twitter messages that do not meet certain criteria before they are processed further. For example, the pipeline may filter out messages that contain certain keywords or messages that are not in the correct format. The filtered messages are then passed on to the next stage of the pipeline for further processing.

Example usage:

```
FilterTwitterMessageStage filterStage = new FilterTwitterMessageStage();
TwitterMessage message = new TwitterMessage("Hello, world!");
filterStage.innerProcess(message);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a filter stage in a pipeline for ingesting Twitter messages, which filters out messages that do not meet a certain filtering rule.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code has dependencies on Apache Commons Pipeline and on several classes from the com.twitter.search package, including SearchRateCounter and IngesterValidMessageFilter.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
   
   This code tracks two metrics: the number of valid messages that pass through the filter and the number of filtered messages that are rejected by the filter. These metrics are tracked using instances of the SearchRateCounter class.
