The `KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage` class is a stage in the Kafka consumer pipeline that consumes messages from a Kafka topic and emits them as `KafkaRawRecord` objects. This class extends the `KafkaConsumerStage` class, which is a part of the Apache Commons Pipeline library. 

The `KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage` class has two constructors. The first constructor takes no arguments and calls the `super()` method with the `getDeserializer()` method as an argument. The `getDeserializer()` method returns a `BaseDeserializer` object that deserializes the binary payload of the Kafka message and wraps it in a `KafkaRawRecord` object. 

The second constructor takes five arguments: `kafkaClientId`, `kafkaTopicName`, `kafkaConsumerGroupId`, `kafkaClusterPath`, and `deciderKey`. These arguments are used to create a `KafkaConsumerStage` object with the specified properties. The `getDeserializer()` method is called to create a deserializer for the `KafkaConsumerStage` object.

The `KafkaRawRecord` class represents a Kafka message with its binary payload and a timestamp. This class is used in the larger project to process and analyze data from Twitter. The `KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage` class is a part of the pipeline that ingests data from Twitter and stores it in Kafka for further processing. 

Here is an example of how the `KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage` class can be used in the larger project:

```
KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage consumerStage = new KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage("client1", "twitter_topic", "group1", "kafka_cluster", "decider1");
Pipeline pipeline = new PipelineBuilder()
    .addStage(consumerStage)
    .addStage(new TwitterDataProcessorStage())
    .addStage(new KafkaProducerStage())
    .build();
pipeline.run();
```

In this example, a `KafkaRawRecordConsumerStage` object is created with the specified properties. This object is added to a pipeline along with a `TwitterDataProcessorStage` object and a `KafkaProducerStage` object. The pipeline is then run to process and analyze data from Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a Kafka consumer stage that emits binary payload wrapped in `ByteArray` for a project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

2. What is the input and output of this stage?
    
    The input of this stage is a `String` and the output is a `KafkaRawRecord`.

3. What is the role of `BaseDeserializer` in this code?
    
    `BaseDeserializer` is used to deserialize the binary payload and create a new `KafkaRawRecord` object with the payload and current time in milliseconds.
