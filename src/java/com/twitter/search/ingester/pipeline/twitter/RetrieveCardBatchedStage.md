The `RetrieveCardBatchedStage` class is part of the Twitter search ingester pipeline and is responsible for retrieving Twitter cards associated with tweets. Twitter cards are metadata that can be added to tweets to provide additional information, such as images, videos, and links. The purpose of this stage is to retrieve the card data for a batch of tweets efficiently using the `TweetService` provided by the `tweetyPie` client.

The `RetrieveCardBatchedStage` class extends the `TwitterBaseStage` class and implements the `doInnerPreprocess` and `innerProcess` methods. The `doInnerPreprocess` method initializes the `tweetyPie` client and the `cardsClient` object, which is a `BatchingClient` that retrieves card data for a batch of tweets. The `innerProcess` method retrieves the card data for a single tweet by calling the `cardsClient` object and updates the tweet message with the retrieved card data.

The `RetrieveCardBatchedStage` class also contains several counters that track various statistics related to the retrieval of card data, such as the number of tweets with cards, the number of tweets without cards, and the number of malformed URLs. These counters are used to monitor the performance of the pipeline and identify any issues that may arise during the retrieval of card data.

Overall, the `RetrieveCardBatchedStage` class plays an important role in the Twitter search ingester pipeline by efficiently retrieving card data for a batch of tweets and updating the tweet messages with the retrieved data. This data is then used by downstream stages in the pipeline to index the tweets and make them searchable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a stage in a pipeline for ingesting Twitter data and retrieving card information for tweets.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guava, Apache Commons Pipeline, SLF4J, and Twitter libraries such as Tweetypie and Twitter Common Text.

3. What statistics are being tracked in this code and why?
- This code tracks various statistics related to the retrieval of card information for tweets, such as the number of tweets with cards, tweets without cards, malformed URLs, and exceptions encountered. These statistics are useful for monitoring the performance and effectiveness of the pipeline.
