The `CollectComparableObjectsStage` class is a stage in a data processing pipeline that collects incoming objects into batches of a configured size and then emits the collection of objects. The stage uses a `TreeSet` to remove duplicates, and incoming objects must implement the `Comparable` interface. 

The stage has several configurable parameters, including the batch size, whether to sort the tweets in reverse order, and a time threshold for emitting a batch. The stage emits a batch when either the batch size is reached or the time threshold is exceeded since the last batch was emitted. The stage also tracks various metrics, including the number of size-based and time-based emits, and the time it takes to emit each batch.

This stage is likely used in a larger data processing pipeline to collect and batch incoming data, such as tweets, for further processing downstream. For example, the batches of tweets could be analyzed for sentiment or used to train a machine learning model. 

Here is an example of how to use this stage in a pipeline:

```
Pipeline pipeline = new BasicPipeline();
pipeline.addStage(new CollectComparableObjectsStage());
pipeline.addStage(new MyCustomStage());
pipeline.run();
```

In this example, the `CollectComparableObjectsStage` is added to the pipeline to collect incoming data and emit batches of objects. The `MyCustomStage` is then added to the pipeline to perform some custom processing on the batches of objects emitted by the `CollectComparableObjectsStage`. Finally, the pipeline is run to process the incoming data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a stage in a pipeline that collects incoming objects into batches of a configured size and emits the collection of objects. It uses a TreeSet to remove duplicates and incoming objects must implement the Comparable interface.

2. What is the significance of the batchSize parameter?
- The batchSize parameter determines the size of the collections that are emitted by the stage. If it is not set to a value greater than 0, an exception will be thrown.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this stage?
- This stage tracks several metrics including the number of times a batch is emitted based on size, the number of times a batch is emitted based on time, and the number of times a batch is emitted based on both size and time. It also tracks the time it takes to emit each batch.
