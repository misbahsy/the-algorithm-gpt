The `TextUrlsFeatureExtractionStage` class is a stage in the Twitter search ingester pipeline that extracts features from Twitter messages. This stage is responsible for parsing URLs, evaluating the offensiveness of the message, and scoring the message text. 

The class extends the `TwitterBaseStage` class, which is a base class for all stages in the Twitter search ingester pipeline. It takes in an `IngesterTwitterMessage` object as input and produces the same object as output. The `@ConsumedTypes` annotation specifies that this stage consumes `TwitterMessage` objects, and the `@ProducesConsumed` annotation specifies that it produces the same type of object that it consumes.

The `doInnerPreprocess()` method calls the `innerSetup()` method, which initializes the `offensiveEvaluator` field by getting an instance of the `TweetOffensiveEvaluator` class from the `wireModule`. The `innerProcess()` method checks if the input object is an instance of `IngesterTwitterMessage`, throws an exception if it is not, and then calls the `extract()` method to extract features from the message. Finally, it emits and counts the message using the `emitAndCount()` method.

The `extract()` method takes in an `IngesterTwitterMessage` object, parses the URLs in the message using the `parseUrls()` method of the `TweetParser` class, evaluates the offensiveness of the message using the `evaluate()` method of the `TweetOffensiveEvaluator` class, and scores the message text using the `scoreTweet()` method of the `TweetTextScorer` class.

The `innerRunStageV2()` method is called by the pipeline framework to run the stage. It takes in an `IngesterTwitterMessage` object, calls the `extract()` method to extract features from the message, and returns the same message object.

Overall, the `TextUrlsFeatureExtractionStage` class is an important stage in the Twitter search ingester pipeline that extracts features from Twitter messages. It parses URLs, evaluates the offensiveness of the message, and scores the message text, which can be used for further processing and analysis in the pipeline.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a stage in a pipeline for processing Twitter messages. It extracts text and URLs from the message, evaluates the message for offensiveness, and scores the message based on its text.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
    
    This code depends on several classes from the `com.twitter.search.common.relevance` package, including `TweetOffensiveEvaluator`, `TwitterMessage`, `TweetTextScorer`, and `TweetParser`. It also depends on classes from the `org.apache.commons.pipeline` package.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
    
    This code expects an input of type `IngesterTwitterMessage` and produces the same type of object as output. The code extracts text and URLs from the message, evaluates the message for offensiveness, and scores the message based on its text. The processed message is emitted and counted.
