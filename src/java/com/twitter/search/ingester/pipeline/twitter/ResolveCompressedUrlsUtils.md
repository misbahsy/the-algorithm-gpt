The `ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils` class is a helper class that provides two methods for working with URL data. The first method, `isResolved`, takes a `UrlData` instance and determines whether the URL is fully resolved. The second method, `getUrlInfo`, takes a `UrlData` instance and creates a `UrlInfo` object from it.

The `isResolved` method determines whether a URL is fully resolved by checking several response fields. First, it checks that the `mediaType` and `linkCategory` fields are set in the `urlDirectInfo` field. Then, it checks that the `HtmlBasics` fields are set. Finally, it checks that the `resolution` field is set and that the `lastHopCanonicalUrl` field is not empty, the `status` field is set to `FetchStatusCode.OK`, and the `lastHopHttpResponseStatusCode` field is set to 200. If all of these conditions are met, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `getUrlInfo` method creates a `UrlInfo` object from a `UrlData` instance. The `UrlInfo` object contains several fields, including the original URL, the resolved URL, the language of the page, the media type, the link category, the description of the page, and the title of the page. The method first checks that the `resolution` field is set in the `UrlData` instance. Then, it populates the `UrlInfo` object with the appropriate values from the `UrlData` instance.

This class is likely used in the larger project to help resolve compressed URLs and extract information about the resolved URLs. The `isResolved` method is used to determine whether a URL is fully resolved, which is important for ensuring that the correct information is extracted from the URL. The `getUrlInfo` method is used to create a `UrlInfo` object from a `UrlData` instance, which can then be used to extract information about the resolved URL. For example, the `mediaType` and `linkCategory` fields can be used to categorize the URL, while the `description` and `title` fields can be used to extract metadata about the page.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides helper functions for resolving compressed URLs and creating a UrlInfo instance from URL data.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the following external libraries: Guava, Apache Commons Lang, and Twitter's Pink Floyd and Spiderduck libraries.

3. What is the significance of the isResolved() method and how is it used?
- The isResolved() method determines if a given UrlData instance is fully resolved by checking if certain response fields are set. It is used to ensure that the URL data is complete before further processing.
