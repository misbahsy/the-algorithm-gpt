The `FilterEventsBySafetyTypeStage` class is a stage in the Twitter Search Ingester Pipeline that filters incoming tweet events based on their safety type. The safety type of a tweet is a classification that determines who can view the tweet. The safety type can be one of four values: public, protected, restricted, or private. 

The purpose of this stage is to only let through create events that match the specified safety type and to let through all delete events. The stage takes in `IngesterTweetEvent` objects and outputs `IngesterTweetEvent` objects. The stage uses counters and delay stats to keep track of the number of events that pass through the stage and the latency of create events. 

The stage has a configurable safety type that can be set using the `setSafetyType` method. The safety type can be set to one of the four valid values. If the safety type is set to `INVALID`, an exception is thrown. 

The `shouldEmit` method determines whether an event should be emitted based on its safety type and the safety type specified for the stage. If the safety type for the stage is `PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED`, then events with a safety type of public or protected will be emitted. Otherwise, only events with a safety type that matches the safety type for the stage will be emitted. 

The `recordCreateLatency` method records the latency of create events and logs a warning if a tweet is created in the future. The `tryToRecordCreateLatency` method increments the counters for the event and determines whether the event should be emitted. If the event is a create event and should be emitted, then the create latency is recorded. 

Overall, this stage is an important part of the Twitter Search Ingester Pipeline as it ensures that only events with the correct safety type are passed on to subsequent stages. This is important for maintaining the privacy and security of tweets. 

Example usage:

```
FilterEventsBySafetyTypeStage stage = new FilterEventsBySafetyTypeStage("PUBLIC", 1000);
pipeline.addStage(stage);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a stage in a pipeline for filtering Twitter events based on their safety type. It only lets through create events that match the specified safety type and all delete events.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guava, Apache Commons Pipeline, and SLF4J.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code and why?
- This code tracks several metrics including the total number of events, the number of create and delete events, and the number of events with different safety types. These metrics are tracked to monitor the performance and behavior of the pipeline and to identify any issues or anomalies.
