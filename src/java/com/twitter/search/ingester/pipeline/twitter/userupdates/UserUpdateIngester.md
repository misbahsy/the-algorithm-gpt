The `UserUpdateIngester` class is responsible for ingesting `UserModification` events and transforming them into a list of `AntisocialUserUpdate`s to be indexed by Earlybirds. The class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `transform` method takes a `UserModification` object and returns a `Future` of a list of `AntisocialUserUpdate`s. The method first checks if the `UserModification` was successful. If not, it returns an empty list. If the `UserModification` was successful, it checks if the `User` is a normal user and has safety information. If not, it returns an empty list. If the `User` is a normal user with safety information, it applies relevant updates from the `UserModification` and converts the safety information into `AntisocialUserUpdate`s based on the type of update. The method returns a list of these `AntisocialUserUpdate`s.

The `getUserUpdateTypes` method takes a `UserModification` object and returns a set of `UserUpdateType`s based on the fields that were updated. If the `UserModification` is a create event, it extracts the `UserUpdateType`s from the safety information. 

The `applyUpdates` method takes a `User` object and a `UserModification` object and applies the relevant updates from the `UserModification` to the `User`.

The `convertToAntiSocialUserUpdate` method takes a `User`, a `UserUpdateType`, and a timestamp and converts the safety information into an `AntisocialUserUpdate` based on the type of update.

The class has several counters and gauges that are used to track metrics related to the ingested `UserModification` events. These metrics are exported to a monitoring system.

Overall, the `UserUpdateIngester` class is an important component of the larger project that ingests `UserModification` events and transforms them into `AntisocialUserUpdate`s to be indexed by Earlybirds.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code ingests UserModification events and transforms them into a list of AntisocialUserUpdates to be indexed by Earlybirds.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several external libraries, including Google Guava, Apache Commons Text, and Twitter Finagle.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
- This code tracks several metrics related to user modifications, including user modification latency, unsuccessful user modification count, irrelevant user modification count, not normal user count, missing safety count, and various user service metrics. It also tracks counters for different types of user updates (e.g. antisocial, NSFW, protected).
