The `ThriftVersionedEventsConverter` class is a utility class that provides methods to convert different types of events into `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instances. These instances are used to represent the versioned events that are ingested into the Twitter search index. 

The class has three public methods: `toDelete()`, `toOutOfOrderAppend()`, and `toPartialUpdate()`. Each of these methods takes in different parameters and returns an `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instance. 

The `toDelete()` method takes in a tweet ID, a user ID, and a `DebugEvents` instance. It creates a `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance with the `DELETE` event type and the given tweet ID. It then calls the `toThriftVersionedEvents()` method to create an `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instance with the given tweet and user IDs and the `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance. 

The `toOutOfOrderAppend()` method takes in a tweet ID, an `EarlybirdFieldConstants.EarlybirdFieldConstant` instance, a long value, and a `DebugEvents` instance. It creates a `ThriftField` instance with the given field ID and long value, and a `ThriftDocument` instance with the `ThriftField` instance. It then creates a `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance with the `OUT_OF_ORDER_APPEND` event type, the given tweet ID, and the `ThriftDocument` instance. Finally, it calls the `toThriftVersionedEvents()` method to create an `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instance with the given tweet ID, an unused user ID, and the `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance. 

The `toPartialUpdate()` method takes in a tweet ID, an `EarlybirdFieldConstants.EarlybirdFieldConstant` instance, an int value, and a `DebugEvents` instance. It creates a `ThriftField` instance with the given field ID and int value, and a `ThriftDocument` instance with the `ThriftField` instance. It then creates a `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance with the `PARTIAL_UPDATE` event type, the given tweet ID, and the `ThriftDocument` instance. Finally, it calls the `toThriftVersionedEvents()` method to create an `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instance with the given tweet ID, an unused user ID, and the `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance. 

The `toThriftVersionedEvents()` method takes in a tweet ID, a user ID, a `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance, and a `DebugEvents` instance. It sets the `createTimeMillis` field of the `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance if it is not already set and a `DebugEvents` instance is provided. It then creates a `Map` of `ThriftIndexingEvent` instances with the given `ThriftIndexingEvent` instance and the `PenguinVersion` instances provided in the constructor. Finally, it creates an `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instance with the given tweet and user IDs and the `Map` of `ThriftIndexingEvent` instances. 

The `updatePenguinVersions()` method takes in a list of `PenguinVersion` instances and updates the `penguinVersions` field of the class with the new list. 

Overall, this class provides a convenient way to convert different types of events into `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instances, which are used to represent the versioned events that are ingested into the Twitter search index. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods to create and ingest these versioned events.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a converter for `ThriftVersionedEvents` and provides methods to create different types of `IngesterThriftVersionedEvents` instances.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
