The `ResolveCompressedUrlsPink` class is responsible for resolving compressed URLs using the PinkFloyd service. The class takes a set of URLs and returns a map of resolved URLs and their corresponding information. 

The `resolveUrls` method takes a set of URLs and first checks if the set is null or empty. If it is, the method returns null. If not, the method splits the set into batches based on a batch size determined by the `SearchDecider` object. The `SearchDecider` object is initialized with a `Decider` object that determines the batch size based on a key value pair. If the key value pair is not found, the batch size is set to 10,000. 

The method then creates a `UrlReadRequest` object for each batch of URLs and sends them to the PinkFloyd service using the `storerClient` object. The `UrlReadRequest` object contains the URLs to be resolved, a `Mask` object that specifies the information to be returned for each URL, and a `ClientIdentifier` object that identifies the PinkFloyd client. The requests are sent in parallel using the `Future` object. 

The method then creates a map to store the resolved URLs and their information. For each `UrlReadResponse` object returned by the PinkFloyd service, the method checks if the response contains resolved URLs. If it does, the method adds the resolved URLs and their information to the map. 

The `getResponseTry` method is a helper method that takes a `Future` object and returns a `Try` object. If the `Try` object is a `Throw` object, the method logs a warning message and returns the `Try` object. If the `Try` object is not a `Throw` object, the method returns the `Try` object. 

This class is used in the larger project to resolve compressed URLs in tweets. The resolved URLs are used to extract information such as the domain, title, and description of the webpage. This information is used to improve the relevance of search results and to provide additional context for tweets. 

Example usage:
```
Storer.ServiceIface storerClient = new Storer.ServiceIface();
String pinkClientId = "12345";
Decider decider = new Decider();
ResolveCompressedUrlsPink resolver = new ResolveCompressedUrlsPink(storerClient, pinkClientId, decider);

Set<String> urls = new HashSet<>();
urls.add("https://t.co/abc123");
urls.add("https://t.co/def456");

Map<String, ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils.UrlInfo> resolvedUrls = resolver.resolveUrls(urls);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code resolves compressed URLs using PinkFloyd.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including Guava, SLF4J, and Twitter's own PinkFloyd and Search libraries.

3. What is the purpose of the `ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils` class?
- The `ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils` class contains utility methods for working with URL data, including methods for checking if a URL has been resolved and for extracting information from resolved URL data.
