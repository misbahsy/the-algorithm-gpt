The `BatchingClient` class is designed to batch single requests of type `RQ` to an underlying client that supports batch calls with multiple values of type `RQ`. The class is thread-safe and uses a `BatchClient` interface to issue requests to the underlying store. 

The `BatchingClient` class has two main data structures: `unsentRequests` and `promises`. `unsentRequests` is a `HashSet` that stores all the requests that have not yet been sent to the underlying store. `promises` is a `ConcurrentHashMap` that stores all the promises for the requests that have been sent to the underlying store. 

The `BatchingClient` class has a constructor that takes a `BatchClient` object and an integer `batchSize`. The `batchSize` parameter specifies the number of requests that must be ready to send before the `BatchingClient` sends a batch request to the underlying store. 

The `BatchingClient` class has a `call` method that takes a request of type `RQ` and returns a `Future` object of type `RP`. The `call` method adds the request to the `unsentRequests` set and creates a new promise for the request in the `promises` map. The `maybeBatchCall` method is then called to check if there are enough requests in the `unsentRequests` set to send a batch request to the underlying store. If there are enough requests, the `executeBatchCall` method is called to send a batch request to the underlying store. 

The `executeBatchCall` method takes a set of requests and sends a batch request to the underlying store using the `batchClient` object. If the batch request is successful, the method resolves the promises for the requests that were sent and sets the promises for the requests that were not sent to an exception. If the batch request fails, the method sets all the promises for the requests to the exception that caused the failure. 

Overall, the `BatchingClient` class is useful for reducing the number of requests sent to an underlying store by batching multiple requests into a single batch request. This can improve the performance of the system by reducing the number of network calls and improving the efficiency of the underlying store. 

Example usage:

```
BatchClient<RQ, RP> batchClient = new MyBatchClient();
BatchingClient<RQ, RP> batchingClient = new BatchingClient<>(batchClient, 10);

RQ request1 = new MyRequest();
RQ request2 = new MyRequest();
RQ request3 = new MyRequest();

Future<RP> response1 = batchingClient.call(request1);
Future<RP> response2 = batchingClient.call(request2);
Future<RP> response3 = batchingClient.call(request3);

response1.onSuccess(rp -> System.out.println("Response 1: " + rp));
response2.onSuccess(rp -> System.out.println("Response 2: " + rp));
response3.onSuccess(rp -> System.out.println("Response 3: " + rp));
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the BatchingClient class?
- The BatchingClient class is used to batch single requests of type RQ -> Future<RP> to an underlying client that supports batch calls with multiple values of type RQ.

2. Is the BatchingClient class thread-safe?
- Yes, the BatchingClient class is thread-safe.

3. What is the purpose of the BatchClient interface?
- The BatchClient interface is used to issue a request to the underlying store which supports batches of requests.
