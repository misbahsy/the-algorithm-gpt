The `CardFieldUtil` class is a utility class that provides methods for working with Twitter Cards. Twitter Cards are a way to attach rich media experiences to tweets, such as images, videos, and audio. The purpose of this class is to extract information from Twitter Cards and set the language of the card in a `TwitterMessage` object.

The class contains two public static final strings, `TITLE_BINDING_KEY` and `DESCRIPTION_BINDING_KEY`, which are binding keys for card fields. These keys are used to extract the title and description of a card.

The `extractBindingValue` method takes a binding key and a `Card2` object as input and returns the binding value of the given binding key if present in `card.getBinding_values()`. If no match is found, it returns null. This method is used to extract the title and description of a card.

The `deriveCardLang` method takes an `IngesterTwitterMessage` object as input and derives the card language from the title and description of the card. It uses the `LanguageIdentifierHelper` class to identify the language of the card and sets it in the `TwitterMessage` object.

This class is used in the larger project to extract information from Twitter Cards and set the language of the card in a `TwitterMessage` object. For example, the following code snippet shows how to use the `CardFieldUtil` class to extract the title and description of a card:

```
Card2 card = ... // get the card object
String title = CardFieldUtil.extractBindingValue(CardFieldUtil.TITLE_BINDING_KEY, card);
String description = CardFieldUtil.extractBindingValue(CardFieldUtil.DESCRIPTION_BINDING_KEY, card);
```

Similarly, the following code snippet shows how to use the `CardFieldUtil` class to derive the card language and set it in a `TwitterMessage` object:

```
IngesterTwitterMessage message = ... // get the message object
CardFieldUtil.deriveCardLang(message);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides utility functions for working with Twitter Cards in the context of the Twitter search ingester pipeline.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `extractBindingValue` method?
    
    The `extractBindingValue` method takes a `bindingKey` string and a `Card2` object as inputs, and returns a string value if a matching `BindingValue` object is found in the `card`'s `binding_values` list. If no match is found, it returns null.

3. What is the purpose of the `deriveCardLang` method?
    
    The `deriveCardLang` method sets the language of a `IngesterTwitterMessage` object based on the language identified in the `cardTitle` and `cardDescription` fields of the message. It uses the `LanguageIdentifierHelper` class to identify the language and sets the result in the `cardLang` field of the message.
