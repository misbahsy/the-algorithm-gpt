The `UserPropertiesManager` class in this code is responsible for managing user properties, such as TWEEPCRED and SpamScore, for a collection of Twitter messages. These properties are fetched from a metastore and used to populate the properties of `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects in the larger project.

The main method in this class is `populateUserProperties(Collection<IngesterTwitterMessage> batch)`, which takes a collection of `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects and populates their user properties by fetching the required data from the metastore. It does this by first extracting unique user IDs from the messages and then calling the `getManhattanUserProperties(List<Long> userIds)` method to fetch the user properties from the metastore. The fetched properties are then used to update the `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects in the batch.

The class also provides methods for processing the TweepCred column data returned from the metastore (`processTweepCredColumn()`) and setting sensitive content, NSFW, and spam flags in the `TwitterMessage` objects (`setSensitiveBits()`).

Here's an example of how the `populateUserProperties()` method can be used:

```java
UserPropertiesManager userPropertiesManager = new UserPropertiesManager(metastoreClient);
Collection<IngesterTwitterMessage> messages = // ... fetch messages
Future<Collection<IngesterTwitterMessage>> populatedMessages = userPropertiesManager.populateUserProperties(messages);
```

This code snippet creates a `UserPropertiesManager` instance with a `metastoreClient`, fetches a collection of `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects, and then populates their user properties using the `populateUserProperties()` method.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `UserPropertiesManager` class and how does it interact with the Manhattan Metastore?
   **Answer**: The `UserPropertiesManager` class is responsible for fetching and populating user properties such as TWEEPCRED and SpamScore from the Manhattan Metastore for a given list of user IDs. It processes the returned data and updates the user properties in the `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects accordingly.

2. **Question**: How does the `populateUserProperties` method work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `populateUserProperties` method takes a collection of `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects as input, extracts the unique user IDs from these messages, and fetches the user properties from the Manhattan Metastore. It then updates the user properties in the input messages and returns a `Future` containing the updated collection of `IngesterTwitterMessage` objects.

3. **Question**: What are the different counters and metrics being tracked in the `UserPropertiesManager` class?
   **Answer**: The `UserPropertiesManager` class tracks various counters and metrics related to user properties, such as missing reputation, invalid reputation, accepted reputation, messages from test users, sensitive content, NSFW users, and spam users. These counters help monitor the performance and behavior of the user properties management process.
