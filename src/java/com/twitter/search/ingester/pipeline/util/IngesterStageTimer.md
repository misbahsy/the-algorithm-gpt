The `IngesterStageTimer` class is a utility class that extends the `StageTimer` class from the Apache Commons Pipeline library. It adds science stats export to the `StageTimer` class. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to measure the time taken by a stage in the pipeline and export the statistics to a monitoring system. The `IngesterStageTimer` class uses the `SearchTimerStats` class from the `com.twitter.search.common.metrics` package to export the statistics. 

The `IngesterStageTimer` class has two fields: `name` and `timer`. The `name` field is a string that represents the name of the stage. The `timer` field is an instance of the `SearchTimerStats` class that is used to export the statistics. 

The `IngesterStageTimer` class has a constructor that takes a string parameter `statName`. The constructor initializes the `name` field with the value of `statName` after checking that it is not blank. It then initializes the `timer` field by calling the `export` method of the `SearchTimerStats` class with the `name`, `TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS`, and `true` parameters. 

The `IngesterStageTimer` class overrides the `start` and `stop` methods of the `StageTimer` class. The `start` method is overridden for code readability, and it simply calls the `super.start` method. The `stop` method is overridden to calculate the time taken by the stage and increment the timer by that amount. It first calls the `super.stop` method to stop the timer. It then calculates the time taken by the stage by subtracting the start time from the current time using the `System.nanoTime` method. Finally, it increments the timer by the time taken by calling the `timerIncrement` method of the `SearchTimerStats` class with the `runTime` parameter. 

This class can be used in the larger project to measure the time taken by each stage in the pipeline and export the statistics to a monitoring system. Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
IngesterStageTimer timer = new IngesterStageTimer("stage1");
timer.start();
// code for stage1
timer.stop();
``` 

In this example, a new `IngesterStageTimer` object is created with the name "stage1". The `start` method is called before the code for stage1 is executed, and the `stop` method is called after the code for stage1 is executed. The time taken by stage1 is calculated and exported to the monitoring system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code adds science stats export to StageTimer for the Ingester pipeline.

2. What is the significance of the SearchTimerStats class?
   The SearchTimerStats class is used to export timer stats for the Ingester pipeline.

3. Why is the start() method overridden?
   The start() method is overridden for code readability, as super.start() already puts the current time in startTime.
