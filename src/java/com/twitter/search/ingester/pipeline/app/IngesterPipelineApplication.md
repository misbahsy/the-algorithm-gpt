The `IngesterPipelineApplication` class is responsible for starting and running the ingester/indexer pipeline. This class extends `AbstractTwitterServer`, which is a Java-friendly server that provides a framework for building Twitter servers. 

The `main()` method is the entry point of the application. It first loads the JNDI configuration and initializes the `ProductionWireModule`, which is responsible for wiring the pipeline stages together. It then adds an admin route to the server using `DeciderHandler`, which is a handler for the decider service. The `BuildInfoStats.export()` method is called to export build information to the metrics system. 

The `runPipelineV1()` and `runPipelineV2()` methods are responsible for running the pipeline. `runPipelineV1()` reads the pipeline configuration file and creates a pipeline using `createPipeline()`. It then starts the pipeline and waits for it to finish. `runPipelineV2()` creates a `RealtimeIngesterPipelineV2` object and runs it. 

The `onExit()` method is called when the server is shutting down. It calls the `finish()` method on the pipeline to gracefully shut it down. 

The class has several flags that can be set to configure the pipeline. The `config_file` flag specifies the pipeline configuration file. The `version` flag specifies whether to run the acp pipeline or non-acp pipeline. The `shard` flag specifies the partition this indexer is responsible for. The `decider_overlay` flag specifies the decider overlay. The `service_identifier` flag specifies the service identifier for mutual TLS authentication. The `environment` flag specifies the environment the app is running in. The `cluster` flag specifies the cluster the app is running in. The `cores` flag specifies the number of cores this cluster is using. 

Overall, this class is responsible for starting and running the ingester/indexer pipeline and provides several flags to configure the pipeline. It uses the `AbstractTwitterServer` framework to provide a Java-friendly server.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code starts the ingester/indexer pipeline.

2. What are the required flags for running this code?
- The required flags are `config_file` and `version`.

3. What is the difference between running pipeline version 1 and version 2?
- Version 1 runs a pipeline created from a config file, while version 2 runs a `RealtimeIngesterPipelineV2` with a specified number of threads.
