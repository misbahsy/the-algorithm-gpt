The `AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for fetching data from the audio space participants strato column. 

The class imports several libraries, including `com.twitter.periscope.api.thriftjava.AudioSpacesLookupContext`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, `com.twitter.strato.catalog.Fetch`, `com.twitter.strato.client.Client`, `com.twitter.strato.client.Fetcher`, `com.twitter.strato.data.Conv`, `com.twitter.strato.thrift.TBaseConv`, and `com.twitter.ubs.thriftjava.Participants`. 

The `AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher` class has a single constructor that takes a `Client` object as a parameter. The constructor initializes a `Fetcher` object that is used to fetch data from the strato column. The `Fetcher` object is created using the `fetcher` method of the `stratoClient` object. The `fetcher` method takes several parameters, including the name of the strato column (`PARTICIPANTS_STRATO_COLUMN`), a boolean value that enables checking types against the catalog (`true`), and two `TBaseConv` objects that are used to convert the data to and from Thrift objects. 

The `AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher` class has a single public method called `fetch` that takes a `String` parameter called `spaceId`. The `fetch` method returns a `Future` object that contains the result of the fetch operation. The `fetch` method calls the `fetch` method of the `Fetcher` object, passing in the `spaceId` parameter and an `EMPTY_AUDIO_LOOKUP_CONTEXT` object. The `fetch` method returns the result of the fetch operation wrapped in a `Future` object. 

Here is an example of how the `AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher` class might be used in the larger project:

```
Client stratoClient = new Client();
AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher fetcher = new AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher(stratoClient);
Future<Fetch.Result<Participants>> result = fetcher.fetch("12345");
result.onSuccess(participants -> {
  // Do something with the participants data
});
```

In this example, a new `Client` object is created, and an `AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher` object is created using the `Client` object. The `fetch` method of the `AudioSpaceParticipantsFetcher` object is called with a `spaceId` parameter of "12345". The result of the fetch operation is wrapped in a `Future` object, which is passed to the `onSuccess` method. The `onSuccess` method is called when the fetch operation completes successfully, and it takes a lambda expression that is used to process the participants data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a Java class that fetches data from a strato column for audio space participants.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on several Twitter libraries, including Stitch, Strato, and Periscope.

3. What is the expected output of the `fetch` method?
    
    The `fetch` method returns a `Future` object that contains a `Fetch.Result` object of type `Participants`, which represents the data fetched from the strato column for the specified audio space.
