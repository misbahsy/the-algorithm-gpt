The `VisibleTokenRatioUtil` class is a utility class that provides a method to extract and normalize the percentage of visible tokens in a given text. This class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which is likely a search engine or a recommendation system that uses natural language processing techniques.

The `extractAndNormalizeTokenPercentage` method takes a `TokenizedCharSequenceStream` object as input, which is a stream of tokenized text. It then iterates over the stream and counts the total number of tokens and the number of tokens that are below a certain threshold (140 in this case). It then calculates the percentage of visible tokens by dividing the number of tokens below the threshold by the total number of tokens. Finally, it normalizes the percentage to a value between 0 and 15 (4 bits) using the `VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer` class.

This method can be used in the larger project to extract and normalize the percentage of visible tokens in a given text, which can be used as a feature in search or recommendation algorithms. For example, if the project is a search engine, this feature can be used to rank search results based on the percentage of visible tokens in the documents. Similarly, if the project is a recommendation system, this feature can be used to recommend content that has a higher percentage of visible tokens to the user.

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```
TokenizedCharSequenceStream tokenSeqStream = new TokenizedCharSequenceStream(text);
VisibleTokenRatioUtil util = new VisibleTokenRatioUtil();
int visibleTokenPercentage = util.extractAndNormalizeTokenPercentage(tokenSeqStream);
```

In this example, `text` is the input text that needs to be processed, and `visibleTokenPercentage` is the normalized percentage of visible tokens in the text.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a utility class for extracting and normalizing the percentage of visible tokens in a given text.

2. What is the significance of the TOKEN_DEMARCATION constant?
- The TOKEN_DEMARCATION constant is used to determine the number of visible tokens in a text, assuming a maximum tweet size of 140 characters.

3. What is the purpose of the VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer class?
- The VisibleTokenRatioNormalizer class is used to normalize the percentage of visible tokens down to 4 bits (essentially rounding it).
