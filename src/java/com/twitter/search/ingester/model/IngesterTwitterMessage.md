The `IngesterTwitterMessage` class is a model class that represents a Twitter message or status. It extends the `TwitterMessage` class and implements the `Comparable`, `IndexerStatus`, and `Partitionable` interfaces. The purpose of this class is to provide a representation of a Twitter message that can be used in the larger project for various purposes such as indexing, searching, and analyzing Twitter data.

The class has two constructors, one that takes a Twitter ID and a list of supported Penguin versions, and another that takes a Twitter ID, a list of Penguin versions, and a `DebugEvents` object. The `DebugEvents` object is used for debugging purposes and is optional. The constructor initializes the `debugEvents` field with a new `DebugEvents` object if the passed object is null.

The class overrides the `compareTo`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods from the `IndexerStatus` interface. The `compareTo` method compares the IDs of two `IndexerStatus` objects, the `equals` method checks if the passed object is an instance of `IngesterTwitterMessage` and has the same ID, and the `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the ID using a hash partition function.

The class also provides a method `isIndexable` that takes a boolean flag `indexProtectedTweets` and returns true if the message is indexable. A message is indexable if it has a user screen name, a non-null ID, and is not a protected tweet (unless `indexProtectedTweets` is true).

Finally, the class provides implementations for the `getTweetId`, `getUserId`, and `getDebugEvents` methods from the `IndexerStatus` interface. The `getTweetId` method returns the ID of the message, the `getUserId` method returns the ID of the user who posted the message, and the `getDebugEvents` method returns the `DebugEvents` object associated with the message.

Example usage:

```java
IngesterTwitterMessage message = new IngesterTwitterMessage(123456789L, Arrays.asList(PenguinVersion.V1));
if (message.isIndexable(true)) {
    // index the message
}
long userId = message.getUserId();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the project?
   - This class represents a Twitter message and is used for indexing and partitioning. It extends the `TwitterMessage` class and implements the `Comparable`, `IndexerStatus`, and `Partitionable` interfaces.
2. What is the significance of the `DebugEvents` field and how is it initialized?
   - The `DebugEvents` field is used for debugging purposes and is initialized either with the provided `DebugEvents` object or a new instance if it is null.
3. What is the `isIndexable` method used for and what are its input parameters?
   - The `isIndexable` method is used to determine if a Twitter message is indexable based on whether it has a user screen name, a tweet ID, and whether it is protected or not. Its input parameter is a boolean value that indicates whether protected tweets should be indexed or not.
