The `ManhattanClientBuilder` object provides methods to build a ManhattanKVClient and ManhattanKVEndpoint. ManhattanKVClient is a client for the Manhattan key-value store, which is a distributed key-value store used by Twitter. ManhattanKVEndpoint is a Finagle endpoint for ManhattanKVClient. Finagle is a protocol-agnostic RPC system developed by Twitter. 

The `buildManhattanEndpoint` method builds a ManhattanKVEndpoint using the provided ManhattanCluster, appId, numTries, maxTimeout, guarantee, serviceIdentifier, statsReceiver, maxItemsPerRequest, and experiments. ManhattanCluster is a cluster of Manhattan servers. appId is the ID of the Manhattan app. numTries is the maximum number of times to try a request. maxTimeout is the maximum request timeout. guarantee is the consistency guarantee. serviceIdentifier is the service ID used for server-to-server authentication. statsReceiver is used to record stats. maxItemsPerRequest is the maximum number of items to request per request. experiments is a sequence of Manhattan client experiments to include. The method builds a ManhattanKVClient using the `buildManhattanClient` method and then builds a ManhattanKVEndpoint using ManhattanKVEndpointBuilder.

The `buildManhattanClient` method builds a ManhattanKVClient using the provided ManhattanCluster, appId, serviceIdentifier, and experiments. ManhattanCluster, appId, and serviceIdentifier are the same as in `buildManhattanEndpoint`. experiments is a sequence of Manhattan client experiments to include. The method creates ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams using the serviceIdentifier and OpportunisticTls.Required. ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams is used to configure ManhattanKVClient to use MTLS (Mutual TLS) for server-to-server authentication. ManhattanKVClient is then created using the provided parameters.

The `buildManhattanV1FinagleClient` method builds a ManhattanKVClient using the provided ManhattanCluster, serviceIdentifier, and experiments. ManhattanCluster and serviceIdentifier are the same as in `buildManhattanClient`. experiments is a sequence of Manhattan client experiments to include. The method creates ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams using the serviceIdentifier and OpportunisticTls.Required. ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams is used to configure ManhattanKVClient to use MTLS for server-to-server authentication. ManhattanKVClient is then created using the provided parameters. ManhattanKVClient is used to build a ManhattanCoordinator.MethodPerEndpoint using Experiments.clientWithExperiments. ManhattanCoordinator is a Thrift service provided by Manhattan. MethodPerEndpoint is a Finagle client for ManhattanCoordinator. The method returns ManhattanCoordinator.MethodPerEndpoint. 

These methods are used to build ManhattanKVClient and ManhattanKVEndpoint objects for use in the larger project. ManhattanKVClient and ManhattanKVEndpoint are used to interact with the Manhattan key-value store. ManhattanKVClient is used to read and write data to the store. ManhattanKVEndpoint is used to provide a Finagle endpoint for ManhattanKVClient. ManhattanCoordinator.MethodPerEndpoint is used to interact with the Manhattan Thrift service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a builder for creating a ManhattanKVClient/Endpoint, which is used to interact with a Manhattan cluster for key-value storage. It solves the problem of needing a simple way to create and configure a client for interacting with a Manhattan cluster.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several Finagle and Manhattan libraries, including `com.twitter.finagle.mtls.authentication`, `com.twitter.finagle.ssl.OpportunisticTls`, `com.twitter.manhattan.v1`, and `com.twitter.storage.client.manhattan.kv`.

3. What are the default values for some of the parameters in the `buildManhattanEndpoint` method?
- The `maxItemsPerRequest` parameter defaults to 100, and the `experiments` parameter defaults to a single experiment, `Experiments.ApertureLoadBalancer`.
