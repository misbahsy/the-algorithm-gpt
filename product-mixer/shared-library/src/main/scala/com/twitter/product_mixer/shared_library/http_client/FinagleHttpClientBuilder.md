The `FinagleHttpClientBuilder` object provides two methods for building a Finagle HTTP client. The first method, `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls`, builds a client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. The second method, `buildFinagleHttpClient`, builds a client without Mutual TLS. 

Both methods take in four parameters: `requestTimeout`, `connectTimeout`, `acquisitionTimeout`, and `statsReceiver`. `requestTimeout` is the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a response from the server. `connectTimeout` is the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a connection to be established with the server. `acquisitionTimeout` is the maximum amount of time the client will wait to acquire a session with the server. `statsReceiver` is used to collect statistics about the client's performance.

The `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` method additionally takes in a `serviceIdentifier` parameter, which is used for S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. This method calls the `buildFinagleHttpClient` method to build the client, and then calls the `withMutualTls` method on the client to enable Mutual TLS with the given `serviceIdentifier`.

This code is likely used in a larger project to build HTTP clients for making requests to other services. The `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` method is likely used for services that require Mutual TLS authentication, while the `buildFinagleHttpClient` method is used for services that do not require Mutual TLS. The `statsReceiver` parameter is likely used to collect performance metrics for the clients, which can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of the system. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.http_client.FinagleHttpClientBuilder
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.NullStatsReceiver
import com.twitter.util.Duration

val requestTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(10)
val connectTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(5)
val acquisitionTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(2)
val statsReceiver = NullStatsReceiver

// Build a client without Mutual TLS
val client = FinagleHttpClientBuilder.buildFinagleHttpClient(
  requestTimeout = requestTimeout,
  connectTimeout = connectTimeout,
  acquisitionTimeout = acquisitionTimeout,
  statsReceiver = statsReceiver
)

// Build a client with Mutual TLS
val serviceIdentifier = ServiceIdentifier("my-service")
val mtlsClient = FinagleHttpClientBuilder.buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls(
  requestTimeout = requestTimeout,
  connectTimeout = connectTimeout,
  acquisitionTimeout = acquisitionTimeout,
  serviceIdentifier = serviceIdentifier,
  statsReceiver = statsReceiver
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a Finagle HTTP client builder that can be used to build a client with S2S Auth/Mutual TLS or a regular client.

2. What dependencies are required to use this code?
    
    This code requires the `com.twitter.finagle` library and its dependencies, as well as the `com.twitter.util.Duration` class.

3. What is the difference between `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` and `buildFinagleHttpClient`?
    
    `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` builds a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth/Mutual TLS, while `buildFinagleHttpClient` builds a regular Finagle HTTP client without S2S Auth/Mutual TLS.
