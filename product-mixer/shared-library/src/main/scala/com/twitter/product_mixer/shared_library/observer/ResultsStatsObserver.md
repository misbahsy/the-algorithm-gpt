The `ResultsStatsObserver` object provides helper functions to observe requests, successes, failures, cancellations, exceptions, latency, and result counts and time-series stats. It supports native functions and asynchronous operations. The object contains several helper functions that create instances of observer classes that extend the `Observer` trait. These observer classes include `StitchObserver`, `ArrowObserver`, `FutureObserver`, and `FunctionObserver`. Each observer class has a corresponding helper function that creates an instance of that observer class. 

The observer classes are used to observe different types of computations. For example, the `StitchObserver` class is used to observe a `Stitch` computation, the `ArrowObserver` class is used to observe an `Arrow` computation, the `FutureObserver` class is used to observe a `Future` computation, and the `FunctionObserver` class is used to observe a function computation. 

Each observer class has an `apply` method that takes a computation and returns a new computation that records stats on the result after the original computation is run. The `ResultsStatsObserver` trait extends the `ResultsObserver` trait and provides an implementation of the `observeResults` method that records the size of the result and calls the `observeResultsWithSize` method. The `observeResultsWithSize` method is abstract and must be implemented by the observer classes to record additional stats on the result.

The `ResultsStatsObserver` object also provides helper functions to create instances of observer classes that transform the result before recording stats. These observer classes include `TransformingArrowResultsStatsObserver`. The `TransformingArrowResultsStatsObserver` class functions like an `ArrowObserver` except that it transforms the result using a provided transformer before recording stats. The original non-transformed result is then returned.

Overall, the `ResultsStatsObserver` object provides a way to observe different types of computations and record stats on the results of those computations. It is a useful tool for monitoring the performance of a system and identifying areas for improvement. 

Example usage:

```
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()
val observer = ResultsStatsObserver.stitchResultsStats[String](s => s.length, statsReceiver, "myScope")
val stitched = Stitch("hello", "world").map(_.mkString(" "))
val observed = observer(stitched)
```
