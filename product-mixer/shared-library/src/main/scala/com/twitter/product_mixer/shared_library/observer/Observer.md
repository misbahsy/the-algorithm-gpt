The `Observer` object in this code provides helper functions to observe requests, success, failures, cancellations, exceptions, and latency. It supports native functions and asynchronous operations. The object contains several classes that extend the `Observer` trait, which provides methods for recording latency, success, and failure stats. 

The `StitchObserver` class can record latency stats, success counters, and detailed failure stats for the results of a Stitch computation. The `ArrowObserver` class can record the latency stats, success counters, and detailed failure stats for the result of an Arrow computation. The `FutureObserver` class can record latency stats, success counters, and detailed failure stats for the results of a Future computation. The `FunctionObserver` class can record latency stats, success counters, and detailed failure stats for the results of a computation.

Each observer class has an `apply` method that takes a computation and returns the result of the computation. The computation is passed through the observer, which records the relevant stats. The `StitchObserver` and `ArrowObserver` classes use the `Stitch` and `Arrow` libraries, respectively, to time the computation. The `FutureObserver` class uses the `Stat.timeFuture` method to time the computation. The `FunctionObserver` class uses the `Stat.time` method to time the computation.

The `Observer` trait provides several methods for recording stats. The `serializeThrowable` method serializes a throwable and its causes into a sequence of strings for scoping metrics. The `latencyStat` method is used to record latency in milliseconds. The `observeLatency` method records the latency from a `Duration`. The `observeSuccess` method records successes. The `observeFailure` method records failures and failure details. The `observe` method records the latency, successes, and failures.

Overall, this code provides a set of helper functions and classes for observing computations and recording relevant stats. These functions and classes can be used throughout the larger project to monitor performance and diagnose issues. For example, the `FutureObserver` class could be used to monitor the performance of asynchronous operations in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides helper functions to observe requests, success, failures, cancellations, exceptions, and latency for native functions and asynchronous operations.

2. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.servo`, and `com.twitter.stitch`.

3. How are latency, success, and failure stats recorded?
- Latency, success, and failure stats are recorded using different observer classes such as `StitchObserver`, `ArrowObserver`, `FutureObserver`, and `FunctionObserver`. These observer classes have methods to record the stats and use a `StatsReceiver` to store the recorded data.
