The `FeatureValueSorter` object contains methods for sorting a list of `CandidateWithDetails` objects based on a specified feature value. The object takes advantage of Scala's type system to provide compile-time safety and type inference.

The `ascending` and `descending` methods are overloaded to handle both required and optional feature values. The `ascending` method sorts the list in ascending order based on the specified feature value, while the `descending` method sorts the list in descending order. If the feature value is missing or failed, the methods use an inferred default value based on the type of the feature value. For numeric values, the default value is the minimum or maximum value, depending on the sort order.

The methods take a `Feature` object as input, which contains the feature value to sort by. The `Feature` object is parameterized by the `Candidate` and `FeatureValue` types. The `Candidate` type is a subtype of `UniversalNoun[Any]`, which represents a noun that can be used in any context. The `FeatureValue` type is parameterized by an `Ordering` context bound, which ensures that the feature value has a defined ordering.

The methods return a `SorterProvider` object, which is used to sort the list of `CandidateWithDetails` objects. The `SorterProvider` object contains an `Ordering` object and a `SortOrder` value, which specifies the sort order.

Here is an example usage of the `ascending` method:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.selector.sorter.FeatureValueSorter
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.UniversalNoun
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.presentation.CandidateWithDetails

case class MyCandidate(id: Int, name: String, score: Double) extends UniversalNoun[Any]

val candidates = List(
  CandidateWithDetails(MyCandidate(1, "Alice", 0.8), Map(Feature("score", 0.8))),
  CandidateWithDetails(MyCandidate(2, "Bob", 0.6), Map(Feature("score", 0.6))),
  CandidateWithDetails(MyCandidate(3, "Charlie", 0.9), Map(Feature("score", 0.9)))
)

val feature = Feature[MyCandidate, Double]("score")

val sorterProvider = FeatureValueSorter.ascending(feature)

val sortedCandidates = sorterProvider.sort(candidates)

// sortedCandidates: List[CandidateWithDetails[MyCandidate]] = List(
//   CandidateWithDetails(MyCandidate(2,Bob,0.6),Map(score -> 0.6)),
//   CandidateWithDetails(MyCandidate(1,Alice,0.8),Map(score -> 0.8)),
//   CandidateWithDetails(MyCandidate(3,Charlie,0.9),Map(score -> 0.9))
// )
```

In this example, we define a case class `MyCandidate` that represents a candidate with an `id`, `name`, and `score`. We create a list of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, each of which contains a `MyCandidate` object and a map of features. We define a `Feature` object that represents the `score` feature. We then call the `ascending` method with the `feature` object to obtain a `SorterProvider` object. Finally, we call the `sort` method on the `SorterProvider` object to sort the list of candidates by the `score` feature in ascending order.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code provides sorting functionality for features in the product mixer component library of the Twitter project.
2. What types of features can be sorted using this code?
- Features with a context-bound ordering can be sorted using this code.
3. What is the purpose of the `typeTag` parameter in some of the methods?
- The `typeTag` parameter allows for inferring the default value from the FeatureValue type when sorting by an optional feature value.
