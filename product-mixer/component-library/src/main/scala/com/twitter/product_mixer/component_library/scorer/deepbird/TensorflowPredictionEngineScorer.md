The code defines a configurable scorer that calls a TensorflowPredictionEngine. The scorer takes in a unique identifier, a TensorflowPredictionEngine, query features, candidate features, and result features. The scorer is designed to be used in a larger project that involves scoring candidates based on query features. 

The TensorflowPredictionEngineScorer class extends the BaseDeepbirdV2Scorer class and overrides the getBatchPredictions method. The getBatchPredictions method takes in a BatchPredictionRequest and a ModelSelector and returns a Future of BatchPredictionResponse. The method calls the getBatchPrediction method of the TensorflowPredictionEngine with the BatchPredictionRequest and ModelSelector as arguments. 

The TensorflowPredictionEngineScorer class is parameterized with four types: Query, Candidate, QueryFeatures, CandidateFeatures, and ResultFeatures. Query and Candidate are types of pipeline queries and candidates to score, respectively. QueryFeatures and CandidateFeatures are types of the query level features consumed by the scorer and the candidate level features consumed by the scorer, respectively. ResultFeatures is the type of the candidate level features returned by the scorer. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a configurable scorer that can be used to score candidates based on query features. The scorer uses a TensorflowPredictionEngine to make predictions and returns a Future of BatchPredictionResponse. The code can be used in a larger project that involves scoring candidates based on query features. 

Example usage:

```
val scorer = new TensorflowPredictionEngineScorer[PipelineQuery, UniversalNoun[Any], BaseDataRecordFeature[PipelineQuery, _], BaseDataRecordFeature[UniversalNoun[Any], _], BaseDataRecordFeature[UniversalNoun[Any], _]](
  ScorerIdentifier("scorer1"),
  tensorflowPredictionEngine,
  queryFeatures,
  candidateFeatures,
  resultFeatures
)

val request = BatchPredictionRequest(Seq(Seq(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)))
val modelSelector = ModelSelector("model1")
val futureResponse = scorer.getBatchPredictions(request, modelSelector)
```
## Questions:
