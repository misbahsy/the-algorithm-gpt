The code defines a feature hydrator for the Advertiser Brand Safety Settings feature in the AdsCandidate model of the Twitter product mixer component library. The purpose of this feature hydrator is to retrieve the Advertiser Brand Safety Settings for a given AdsCandidate from a ReadableStore and add it to the existingFeatures FeatureMap. 

The AdvertiserBrandSafetySettingsFeature object extends FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure and defines the default value for the feature as None. The AdvertiserBrandSafetySettingsFeatureHydrator case class is annotated with @Singleton and is responsible for retrieving the Advertiser Brand Safety Settings for a given AdsCandidate. It takes a ReadableStore of AdvertiserBrandSafetySettings as an input and implements the CandidateFeatureHydrator trait. 

The apply method of the AdvertiserBrandSafetySettingsFeatureHydrator takes a Query, Candidate, and existingFeatures FeatureMap as input and returns a Stitch of FeatureMap. It retrieves the Advertiser Brand Safety Settings for the given AdsCandidate from the ReadableStore and adds it to the FeatureMap using the FeatureMapBuilder. Finally, it returns the FeatureMap wrapped in a Stitch.

This code can be used in the larger project to retrieve the Advertiser Brand Safety Settings for a given AdsCandidate and add it to the existingFeatures FeatureMap. This FeatureMap can then be used by other components of the product mixer to generate a final AdsCandidate. 

Example usage:

```
val adCandidate: AdsCandidate = ???
val query: AdsQuery with PipelineQuery = ???
val existingFeatures: FeatureMap = ???
val adBrandSafetySettingsStore: ReadableStore[Long, ad.AdvertiserBrandSafetySettings] = ???

val adBrandSafetySettingsFeatureHydrator = AdvertiserBrandSafetySettingsFeatureHydrator(query, adCandidate, existingFeatures, adBrandSafetySettingsStore)

val featureMapStitch: Stitch[FeatureMap] = adBrandSafetySettingsFeatureHydrator.apply(query, adCandidate, existingFeatures)

val featureMap: FeatureMap = featureMapStitch.get
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a feature hydrator for the AdsCandidate model that retrieves the AdvertiserBrandSafetySettings feature from a ReadableStore and adds it to the existingFeatures map.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several packages including com.twitter.adserver, com.twitter.product_mixer, com.twitter.stitch, and com.twitter.storehaus.
3. What is the expected input and output of the apply method?
- The apply method takes in a Query, Candidate, and existingFeatures map and returns a Stitch of the updated FeatureMap. The expected output is a FeatureMap with the AdvertiserBrandSafetySettings feature added.
