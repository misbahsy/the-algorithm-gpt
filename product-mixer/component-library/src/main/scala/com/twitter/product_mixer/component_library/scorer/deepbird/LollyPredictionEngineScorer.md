The `LollyPredictionEngineScorer` class is a scorer component that locally loads a Deepbird model and uses it to score candidates. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to score candidates based on a Deepbird model without having to make requests to a remote server. 

The class takes in a unique identifier for the scorer, a `PredictionEngine` object that hosts the Deepbird model, a `FeaturesScope` object that represents the candidate features to convert and pass to the Deepbird model, and a set of `ResultFeatures` objects that represent the candidate features returned by the model. 

The class extends the `Scorer` abstract class and overrides its `apply` method. The `apply` method takes in a pipeline query and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects, which represent the candidates to be scored along with their features. The method then applies the Deepbird model to each candidate's features and returns a sequence of `FeatureMap` objects, which represent the scored candidates along with their features. 

The `LollyPredictionEngineScorer` class uses several other classes from the `com.twitter.product_mixer` and `com.twitter.ml` packages to convert and extract features from the candidate features and prediction responses. 

Overall, this class provides a way to score candidates using a locally loaded Deepbird model, which can be useful in situations where making requests to a remote server is not feasible or desirable. 

Example usage:

```scala
val scorer = new LollyPredictionEngineScorer[PipelineQuery, UniversalNoun[Any], BaseDataRecordFeature[PipelineQuery, _], BaseDataRecordFeature[UniversalNoun[Any], _], BaseDataRecordFeature[UniversalNoun[Any], _]](
  ScorerIdentifier("lolly_scorer"),
  predictionEngine,
  candidateFeatures,
  resultFeatures
)

val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(CandidateWithFeatures(candidate1, candidate1Features), CandidateWithFeatures(candidate2, candidate2Features))
val scoredCandidates = scorer.apply(query, candidates).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a scorer that loads a Deepbird model and applies it to a set of candidate features. It is part of the component library for the product mixer project at Twitter.

2. What are the input and output types for the scorer, and what are the requirements for the result features? 
- The input types are Query, Candidate, QueryFeatures, CandidateFeatures, and ResultFeatures, which are all defined as generic type parameters. The resultFeatures parameter cannot be empty. The output is a sequence of FeatureMaps.

3. What is the role of the PredictionEngine and how is it used in the apply method? 
- The PredictionEngine is a hosting service for the Deepbird model. In the apply method, it is used to apply the model to each candidate's features and return a prediction response, which is then converted into a FeatureMap using the resultsDataRecordExtractor.
