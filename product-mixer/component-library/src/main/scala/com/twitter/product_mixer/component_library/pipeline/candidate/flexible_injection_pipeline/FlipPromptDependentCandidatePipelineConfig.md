The `FlipPromptDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class is a dependent candidate pipeline configuration for Flexible Injection Pipeline (FLIP) candidates. It fetches prompts from FLIP, which is inside the onboarding-task-service. 

This class extends the `DependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class, which is a configuration for a dependent candidate pipeline. A dependent candidate pipeline is a pipeline that depends on another pipeline to provide input data. In this case, the input data is prompts from FLIP. 

The `FlipPromptDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class has four main components: candidate source, query transformer, result transformer, and decorator. 

The `candidateSource` is a `PromptCandidateSource` that provides prompts from FLIP. 

The `queryTransformer` is a `CandidatePipelineQueryTransformer` that transforms a `PipelineQuery` with `HasFlipInjectionParams` into a `GetInjectionsRequest` that can be sent to FLIP. 

The `resultTransformer` is a `CandidatePipelineResultsTransformer` that transforms `IntermediatePrompt` objects into `BasePromptCandidate[Any]` objects. 

The `decorator` is a `CandidateDecorator` that decorates `BasePromptCandidate[Any]` objects with additional information. In this case, the decorator is a `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` that uses a `UrtItemCandidateDecorator`, a `FlipPromptUrtModuleBuilder`, and a `FlipPromptModuleGrouping` to decorate the candidates. 

Additionally, there is a `featuresFromCandidateSourceTransformers` sequence that contains a `FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer`. This transformer extracts features from the prompts fetched from FLIP. 

Overall, this class is used to configure a dependent candidate pipeline that fetches prompts from FLIP and decorates them with additional information. This pipeline can be used in the larger project to generate FLIP candidates for various use cases. 

Example usage:

```
val promptCandidateSource = new PromptCandidateSource()
val flipPromptPipelineConfig = new FlipPromptDependentCandidatePipelineConfig(
  identifier = CandidatePipelineIdentifier("flip-prompt-pipeline"),
  enabledDeciderParam = Some(DeciderParam(true)),
  supportedClientParam = Some(FSParam(true)),
  promptCandidateSource = promptCandidateSource
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a dependent candidate pipeline for Flexible Injection Pipeline Candidates that fetches prompts from FLIP (inside onboarding-task-service). It solves the problem of generating prompts for the Flexible Injection Pipeline.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code has dependencies on various packages and classes such as `com.twitter.onboarding.task.service.thriftscala.GetInjectionsRequest`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.candidate_source.flexible_injection_pipeline.IntermediatePrompt`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.pipeline.candidate.flexible_injection_pipeline.transformer.FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer`, etc.

3. What is the role of the `FlipPromptDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class?
- The `FlipPromptDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class is responsible for configuring the dependent candidate pipeline for Flexible Injection Pipeline Candidates. It defines the candidate source, query transformer, result transformer, decorator, and feature transformers for the pipeline.
