The `FlipQueryTransformer` is a Scala object that provides a method to transform a `PipelineQuery` object into a `flip.GetInjectionsRequest` object. This object is used to make a request to the Flip service, which is responsible for providing personalized onboarding experiences to Twitter users. 

The `transform` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object that has `HasFlipInjectionParams` mixed in. This trait provides additional parameters that are required for the Flip service. The method then creates a `flip.ClientContext` object and a `flip.DisplayContext` object using the relevant parameters from the `PipelineQuery`. It also creates a `flip.RequestTargetingContext` object using some additional parameters from the `PipelineQuery`. Finally, it creates a `flip.GetInjectionsRequest` object using all of the previously created objects and some additional parameters.

The `FlipQueryTransformer` is used in the larger project to facilitate communication between the `PipelineQuery` objects used in the product mixer and the Flip service. By providing a method to transform `PipelineQuery` objects into `flip.GetInjectionsRequest` objects, the `FlipQueryTransformer` allows the product mixer to make requests to the Flip service and receive personalized onboarding experiences for Twitter users.

Example usage:

```scala
val pipelineQuery = PipelineQuery(
  clientContext = ClientContext(
    userId = "12345",
    guestId = "67890",
    appId = "twitter",
    deviceId = "abcdefg",
    countryCode = "US",
    languageCode = "en",
    userAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36",
    guestIdMarketing = "12345",
    guestIdAds = "67890",
    isTwoffice = false,
    ipAddress = "127.0.0.1"
  ),
  displayLocation = "timeline",
  rankingDisablerWithLatestControlsAvailable = false,
  isEmptyState = false,
  isFirstRequestAfterSignup = false,
  isEndOfTimeline = false,
  flipInjectionParams = FlipInjectionParams(
    experimentName = "onboarding_experiment",
    experimentVariant = "variant_a"
  )
)

val getInjectionsRequest = FlipQueryTransformer.transform(pipelineQuery)
``` 

In this example, a `PipelineQuery` object is created with some sample parameters. The `FlipQueryTransformer` is then used to transform this object into a `flip.GetInjectionsRequest` object. This object can then be used to make a request to the Flip service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a transformer for a candidate pipeline query in the flexible injection pipeline of a product mixer component library. It transforms the query into a `GetInjectionsRequest` object from the `flip` package.

2. What is the relationship between `PromptType` and `SUPPORTED_PROMPT_TYPES`?
- `PromptType` is an enumeration of different types of prompts, and `SUPPORTED_PROMPT_TYPES` is a set of `PromptType` values that are supported by this code.

3. What is the significance of the `transform` method and its parameters?
- The `transform` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object that has `HasFlipInjectionParams` mixed in, and returns a `GetInjectionsRequest` object. The `PipelineQuery` object is transformed into a `GetInjectionsRequest` object by extracting relevant information from its fields and constructing a new object with the `flip` package.
