The `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` is a Scala trait that is used to assign items to different modules based on the provided `GroupByKey`. It is similar to the `UrtItemInModuleDecorator`, but it can assign items to different modules based on the provided `GroupByKey`. 

The `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` takes in four parameters: `urtItemCandidateDecorator`, `moduleBuilder`, `groupByKey`, and `identifier`. The `urtItemCandidateDecorator` is a decorator that decorates individual item candidates. The `moduleBuilder` builds a module from a particular candidate group. The `groupByKey` assigns each candidate a module group. Returning `None` will result in the candidate not being assigned to a module. The `identifier` is a unique identifier for the decorator.

The `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` applies the `urtItemCandidateDecorator` to the input candidates and then groups the candidates into modules based on the `groupByKey`. The decorator then builds a `UrtModulePresentation` for each module and adds it to each candidate's decoration. Finally, the decorator returns the decorated candidates.

The `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` is used in the larger project to assign items to different modules based on the provided `GroupByKey`. This allows for more flexibility in how items are grouped and displayed in the application. For example, items can be grouped by topic, user, or any other criteria that can be defined by the `GroupByKey`. 

Here is an example of how the `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` can be used:

```scala
val decorator = UrtMultipleModulesDecorator(
  urtItemCandidateDecorator = myItemDecorator,
  moduleBuilder = myModuleBuilder,
  groupByKey = myGroupByKey
)

val candidates: Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[BuilderInput]] = ...

val decoratedCandidates: Seq[Decoration] = decorator(query, candidates).get
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a decorator for assigning items to different modules based on a provided key. It is part of the component library for the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method in the `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` class?
- The `apply` method takes in a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[BuilderInput]` and returns a `Stitch[Seq[Decoration]]`.

3. What is the purpose of the `GroupByKey` trait and how is it used in this code?
- The `GroupByKey` trait is used to assign each candidate a module group based on the provided key. It takes in a `Query`, a `BuilderInput`, and a `FeatureMap`, and returns an `Option[Key]`. It is used in the `UrtMultipleModulesDecorator` class to group candidates into modules based on the provided key.
