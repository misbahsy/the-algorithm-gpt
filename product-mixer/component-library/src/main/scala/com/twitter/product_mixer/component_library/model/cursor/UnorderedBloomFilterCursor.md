The code defines two cursor models, `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor` and `UnorderedBloomFilterCursor`, that can be used for cursoring over an unordered candidate source. The purpose of these cursors is to efficiently deduplicate candidates from the candidate list.

The `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor` model extends the `UrtPipelineCursor` and takes an initial sort index and a bloom filter as parameters. The bloom filter is a space-efficient and mutable variant of the BloomFilter class used for storing long integers. On each server round-trip, the server adds the IDs of the candidates into the bloom filter. On subsequent requests, the client returns the cursor, and the bloom filter can be sent to the downstream's bloom filter parameter in serialized form, or exclude candidates locally via a filter on the candidate source pipeline.

The `UnorderedBloomFilterCursor` model extends the `PipelineCursor` and takes a bloom filter as a parameter. This cursor can be used in a similar way to the `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor`, but does not have an initial sort index.

These cursor models can be used in the larger project to efficiently deduplicate candidates from an unordered candidate source. For example, in a search application, the cursor can be used to efficiently retrieve and deduplicate search results. The bloom filter can be used to exclude candidates that have already been seen, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the server and client. This can improve the performance of the application and reduce the load on the server. 

Example usage:

```
val bloomFilter = new AdaptiveLongIntBloomFilter(1000000, 0.01)
val cursor = UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor(0, bloomFilter)
// Use the cursor to retrieve and deduplicate search results
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the bloom filter in this code?
   - The bloom filter is used to deduplicate candidates from the candidate list by storing their IDs in a space-efficient and mutable variant of the BloomFilter class used for storing long integers.
2. What is the difference between `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor` and `UnorderedBloomFilterCursor`?
   - `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor` extends `UrtPipelineCursor` and has an additional parameter `initialSortIndex`, while `UnorderedBloomFilterCursor` extends `PipelineCursor` and does not have this parameter.
3. What is the significance of the `com.twitter.search.common.util.bloomfilter` import statement?
   - The import statement is used to import the `AdaptiveLongIntBloomFilter` class, which is used to implement the bloom filter in this code.
