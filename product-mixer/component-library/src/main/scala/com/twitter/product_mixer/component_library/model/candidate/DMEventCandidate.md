This code defines two classes, `DMEventCandidate` and `DMMessageSearchCandidate`, which represent different types of direct message events in Twitter. The `DMEventCandidate` class is the preferred version and should be used over all other variants. Both classes extend the `UniversalNoun` class and take a `Long` ID as a parameter. 

The `DMEventCandidate` class has an implementation of the `equals` method that checks for referential equality, cached hashcode equality, and field values equality. It also has a cached hashcode that is instantiated once on object construction. The `DMMessageSearchCandidate` class has a similar implementation of the `equals` method and cached hashcode. 

Both classes have notes that any additional fields should be added as a `Feature` on the candidate's `FeatureMap`. If the features come from the candidate source itself, then `CandidatePipelineConfig.featuresFromCandidateSourceTransformers` can be used to extract features from the candidate source response. 

The `DMMessageSearchCandidate` class is deprecated and should be replaced with `DMEventCandidate`. 

The `DMEventCandidate` class has a companion object that defines an `apply` method that takes a `Long` ID and returns a new instance of `DMEventCandidate`. 

Overall, these classes provide a way to represent direct message events in Twitter and ensure that they are compared and hashed correctly. They also provide guidance on how to add additional fields as features and how to handle deprecated classes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines two classes, `DMEventCandidate` and `DMMessageSearchCandidate`, which represent different types of DM events. The purpose of these classes is to model DM events in a canonical way and provide a high-performance implementation of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods.

2. What are the domain-specific constraints that are being leveraged in the implementation of `equals` and `hashCode` methods?
- The implementation of `equals` and `hashCode` methods leverages the domain-specific constraints that all fields used to construct the hashCode are immutable, including the inability to mutate the object reference on for an existing instantiated candidate and the inability to mutate the field object instance itself. This ensures that the hashCode is consistent with object equality.

3. What is the difference between `DMEventCandidate` and `DMMessageSearchCandidate`?
- `DMEventCandidate` represents DM events such as Message Create, Conversation Create, Join conversation, etc. and is the preferred version over all other variants. `DMMessageSearchCandidate` represents events from Elastic Search and is now deprecated in favor of `DMEvent`.
