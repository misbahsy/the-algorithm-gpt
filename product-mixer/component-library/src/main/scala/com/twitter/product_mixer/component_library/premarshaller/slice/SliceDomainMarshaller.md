The `SliceDomainMarshaller` class is a domain marshaller that generates slices for most candidates automatically. However, in rare cases where a candidate contains more than an ID, a different presentation can be provided by decorators that implement `BaseSliceItemPresentation`. 

The `SliceDomainMarshaller` class extends the `DomainMarshaller` class and implements the `SliceBuilder` trait. It takes in a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` and returns a `Slice`. The `Slice` is generated by mapping over the `CandidateWithDetails` sequence and creating a new sequence of `BaseSliceItemPresentation` objects. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object has a `BaseSliceItemPresentation`, the `sliceItem` is used to create a new `BaseSliceItemPresentation`. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object does not have a `BaseSliceItemPresentation`, the `candidate` is matched against a series of cases to determine the type of `BaseSliceItemPresentation` to create. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object has a `presentation` that is not a `BaseSliceItemPresentation`, an `UnsupportedPresentationDomainMarshallerException` is thrown. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object is a `ModuleCandidateWithDetails`, an `UnsupportedModuleDomainMarshallerException` is thrown.

This class is used in the larger project to generate slices for most candidates automatically. It can be used by passing in a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` to generate a `Slice`. 

Example usage:

```
val query: PipelineQuery = ???
val candidateWithDetails: Seq[CandidateWithDetails] = ???
val sliceDomainMarshaller = SliceDomainMarshaller()
val slice: Slice = sliceDomainMarshaller(query, candidateWithDetails)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a domain marshaller that generates slices for most candidates, but allows for a different presentation to be provided by decorators. It is used to create slices for various types of candidates in the project.

2. What are some examples of candidates that would require a different presentation than the one generated automatically?
- Candidates that contain more than an id, such as cursors that require a value/type, would require a different presentation than the one generated automatically.

3. What exceptions might be thrown during the execution of this code, and why?
- UndecoratedCandidateDomainMarshallerException, UnsupportedCandidateDomainMarshallerException, UnsupportedPresentationDomainMarshallerException, and UnsupportedModuleDomainMarshallerException might be thrown during the execution of this code. These exceptions are thrown when a candidate does not have a required decorator or when a presentation or module is not supported.
