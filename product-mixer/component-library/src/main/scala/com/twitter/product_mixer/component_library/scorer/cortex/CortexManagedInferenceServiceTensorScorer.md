The `CortexManagedInferenceServiceTensorScorer` class is a scorer component that uses a machine learning model to score a set of candidates based on a given query. It takes in a `ModelInferRequestBuilder` that builds a request to the machine learning model, a list of `FeatureWithExtractor` objects that define the features to be extracted from the model's output, an `MLModelInferenceClient` that sends the request to the model, and a `StatsReceiver` for tracking statistics. 

The `apply` method takes in a query and a list of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects, which contain the candidates to be scored and their associated features. It builds a batch inference request using the `ModelInferRequestBuilder`, sends the request to the machine learning model using the `MLModelInferenceClient`, and extracts the desired features from the model's output using the `extractResponse` method. The extracted features are returned as a list of `FeatureMap` objects.

The `extractResponse` method takes in the query, a list of candidates, and the model's output as a list of `InferOutputTensor` objects. It uses the `ModelFeatureExtractor` associated with each `FeatureWithExtractor` to extract the desired feature values from the output. It then builds a `FeatureMap` for each candidate with the extracted feature values and returns a list of these `FeatureMap` objects.

Overall, this class provides a way to score a set of candidates using a machine learning model and extract specific features from the model's output. It can be used as a component in a larger pipeline for ranking and selecting candidates based on their scores and features. 

Example usage:

```scala
val scorer = new CortexManagedInferenceServiceTensorScorer[MyQuery, MyCandidate](
  ScorerIdentifier("my_scorer"),
  new MyModelInferRequestBuilder(),
  Seq(
    FeatureWithExtractor(MyFeature1, new MyFeature1Extractor()),
    FeatureWithExtractor(MyFeature2, new MyFeature2Extractor())
  ),
  new MyMLModelInferenceClient(),
  new MyStatsReceiver()
)

val query = new MyQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(new CandidateWithFeatures(new MyCandidate(...), new MyFeatureMap(...)), ...)
val scoresAndFeatures = scorer(query, candidates).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a tensor scorer for a machine learning model inference service called Cortex. It is part of the product mixer component library for scoring and ranking products. 

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including Finagle for stats, Stitch for asynchronous programming, and the Cortex ML model inference client. 

3. What is the purpose of the `extractResponse` method and how does it work?
- The `extractResponse` method takes in a query, a list of candidates, and a list of tensor outputs from the Cortex service, and returns a list of feature maps. It extracts the features for each candidate from the tensor outputs using the provided feature extractors, and updates the feature map result for each candidate. If the number of extracted features does not match the number of candidates, it throws a PipelineFailure exception.
