The code defines a class called `WhoToFollowDependentCandidatePipelineConfigBuilder` that builds a configuration for a candidate pipeline used in the Twitter product mixer. The configuration is specific to the "Who to Follow" module, which suggests Twitter users for a given user to follow. 

The class takes a `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` object as a constructor argument, which is used to populate the pipeline with candidate users. The `build` method of the class takes several parameters that configure the pipeline, including a `BaseModuleDisplayTypeBuilder` object that determines how the suggested users are displayed to the user. 

Other parameters include an identifier for the pipeline, decider and client parameters that determine whether the pipeline is enabled and supported by the client, alerts and gates that control the flow of candidates through the pipeline, filters that remove unwanted candidates, and a feedback action info builder that determines how user feedback is handled. 

The configuration also includes several parameters related to the layout and display of the "Who to Follow" module, such as the display location, supported layouts, and layout version. Finally, the configuration can optionally include a feature that excludes certain user IDs from the pipeline.

Overall, this code is an important part of the "Who to Follow" module in the Twitter product mixer, allowing for the customization and configuration of the candidate pipeline that suggests users for a given user to follow.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that builds a configuration for a dependent candidate pipeline called WhoToFollow. It takes in various parameters and returns a WhoToFollowDependentCandidatePipelineConfig object.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource, UserCandidate, Feature, Alert, Filter, BaseGate, PipelineQuery, FSParam, Param, DeciderParam, BaseFeedbackActionInfoBuilder, and BaseModuleDisplayTypeBuilder.

3. Are there any optional parameters in the build method and what are their defaults?
- Yes, there are several optional parameters in the build method, including enabledDeciderParam, supportedClientParam, alerts, gates, filters, feedbackActionInfoBuilder, displayLocationParam, supportedLayoutsParam, layoutVersionParam, and excludedUserIdsFeature. Their default values are None, None, an empty sequence, an empty sequence, an empty sequence, None, a static parameter, a static parameter, a static parameter, and None, respectively.
