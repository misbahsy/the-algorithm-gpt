The `AsyncParamGatedQueryFeatureHydrator` class is a type of `QueryFeatureHydrator` that hydrates asynchronously for features to be used before a specified pipeline step. It is conditionally based on a `Param` that can turn the `QueryFeatureHydrator` on and off. 

This class takes in three parameters: `enabledParam`, `hydrateBefore`, and `queryFeatureHydrator`. `enabledParam` is the `Param` that turns the `QueryFeatureHydrator` on and off. `hydrateBefore` is the `PipelineStepIdentifier` step that ensures the feature is hydrated before. `queryFeatureHydrator` is the underlying `QueryFeatureHydrator` to run when `enabledParam` is true. 

The class extends `QueryFeatureHydrator`, `Conditionally`, and `AsyncHydrator`. It overrides several methods from `QueryFeatureHydrator`, including `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, `onlyIf`, and `hydrate`. 

The `identifier` method returns a `FeatureHydratorIdentifier` that concatenates "AsyncParamGated" with the name of the `queryFeatureHydrator` identifier. The `alerts` method returns the alerts from the `queryFeatureHydrator`. The `features` method returns the features from the `queryFeatureHydrator`. 

The `onlyIf` method takes in a `Query` and returns a boolean value. It uses `Conditionally.and` to check if the `queryFeatureHydrator` and `enabledParam` are true for the given `query`. 

The `hydrate` method takes in a `Query` and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]`. It calls the `hydrate` method from the `queryFeatureHydrator` with the given `query`. 

Overall, this class provides a way to conditionally hydrate features asynchronously based on a `Param` and ensure that the feature is hydrated before a specified pipeline step. It can be used in a larger project to improve the performance of feature hydration by only hydrating features when necessary and before they are needed in the pipeline. 

Example usage:
```
val enabledParam = Param[Boolean]("enabled", true)
val hydrateBefore = PipelineStepIdentifier("step1")
val queryFeatureHydrator = MyQueryFeatureHydrator()
val asyncParamGatedQueryFeatureHydrator = AsyncParamGatedQueryFeatureHydrator(enabledParam, hydrateBefore, queryFeatureHydrator)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a class called `AsyncParamGatedQueryFeatureHydrator` that extends several other classes and interfaces to provide a query feature hydrator that is conditionally based on a parameter and hydrates asynchronously. It likely fits into a larger system for processing queries and features.
2. What is the significance of the `enabledParam` and `hydrateBefore` parameters? 
- `enabledParam` is the parameter that turns the query feature hydrator on and off, while `hydrateBefore` is the pipeline step identifier that ensures the feature is hydrated before a certain step. These parameters are important for controlling the behavior of the hydrator and ensuring it runs at the appropriate time.
3. What is the purpose of the `onlyIf` method and how does it relate to the `enabledParam` parameter? 
- The `onlyIf` method determines whether the query feature hydrator should be applied to a given query based on the `enabledParam` parameter. It uses the `Conditionally.and` method to combine the `enabledParam` condition with other conditions from the `queryFeatureHydrator` to determine whether the hydrator should run.
