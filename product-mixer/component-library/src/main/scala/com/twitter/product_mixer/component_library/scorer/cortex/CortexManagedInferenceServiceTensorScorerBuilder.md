The `CortexManagedInferenceServiceTensorScorerBuilder` class is responsible for building a configurable `Scorer` that can call into a desired Cortex Managed ML Model Service. This class takes in a few parameters to build the `Scorer`, including a unique identifier for the scorer, a `ModelInferRequestBuilder`, a sequence of result features and their tensor extractors for each candidate, and an `MLModelInferenceClient`.

The `build` method of this class takes in the above parameters and returns a `Scorer` object. The `Scorer` object is used to score candidates based on a given query. The `Scorer` object is built using the `CortexManagedInferenceServiceTensorScorer` class, which takes in the same parameters as the `build` method, along with a `StatsReceiver` object.

The `CortexManagedInferenceServiceTensorScorer` class is responsible for making requests to the Cortex Managed ML Model Service to score candidates based on a given query. It uses the `MLModelInferenceClient` to make requests to the service and extract features from the results using the provided tensor extractors. The `StatsReceiver` object is used to track statistics related to the scoring process.

Overall, this code provides a way to build a configurable `Scorer` that can call into a desired Cortex Managed ML Model Service to score candidates based on a given query. This can be useful in a larger project that involves scoring candidates based on user queries, such as a recommendation system. An example usage of this code might look like:

```
val scorerBuilder = new CortexManagedInferenceServiceTensorScorerBuilder(statsReceiver)
val scorer = scorerBuilder.build(scorerIdentifier, modelInferRequestBuilder, resultFeatureExtractors, client)
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(...)
val scores = candidates.map(candidate => scorer.score(query, candidate))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code builds a configurable Scorer to call into a desired Cortex Managed ML Model Service, allowing for scoring of candidates based on query and candidate level features.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.scorer.common.MLModelInferenceClient`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.scorer.Scorer`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `build` method?
- The `build` method expects a unique identifier for the scorer, a `ModelInferRequestBuilder` for the query and candidate types, a sequence of result features and their tensor extractors for each candidate, and an `MLModelInferenceClient`. The output is a `Scorer` object that takes in a query and candidate and returns a score.
