This code defines two classes, `TopicCandidate` and `CategorizedTopicCandidate`, which are used as models for topic candidates in a larger project. Both classes extend the `BaseTopicCandidate` trait, which itself extends the `UniversalNoun` trait. 

The `TopicCandidate` class is the canonical model for topic candidates and should be preferred over other variants. It takes a `Long` id as a parameter and has an implementation of the `canEqual` method from the `UniversalNoun` trait. It also has a custom implementation of the `equals` method that leverages referential equality short circuit, cached hashcode equality short circuit, and field values only being checked if the hashCodes are equal to handle the unlikely case of a hashCode collision. The `hashCode` is cached as a `val` and is only computed once on object construction. 

The `CategorizedTopicCandidate` class is similar to `TopicCandidate`, but it also takes an optional `Long` `categoryId` and an optional `String` `categoryName` as parameters. It has an implementation of the `canEqual` method and a custom implementation of the `equals` method that leverages referential equality short circuit, cached hashcode equality short circuit, and field values only being checked if the hashCodes are equal to handle the unlikely case of a hashCode collision. The `hashCode` is cached as a `val` and is only computed once on object construction. 

Both classes have notes that any additional fields should be added as a `Feature` on the candidate's `FeatureMap`. If the features come from the candidate source itself, then `CandidatePipelineConfig.featuresFromCandidateSourceTransformers` can be used to extract features from the candidate source response. 

The purpose of these classes is to provide a standardized model for topic candidates in the larger project. They can be used to represent topic candidates in various contexts, such as in recommendation systems or search engines. The custom implementations of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods ensure that topic candidates can be compared and hashed efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseTopicCandidate` trait?
- The `BaseTopicCandidate` trait extends `UniversalNoun[Long]` and likely provides common functionality or properties for all topic candidates.

2. What is the difference between `TopicCandidate` and `CategorizedTopicCandidate`?
- `TopicCandidate` is the canonical model for a topic candidate, while `CategorizedTopicCandidate` is a deprecated model that includes additional fields for category information.

3. Why is the `hashCode` value cached as a `val` in both `TopicCandidate` and `CategorizedTopicCandidate`?
- The `hashCode` value is cached as a `val` to prevent the need to recompute it on each `hashCode()` invocation, which can improve performance. However, this is only safe if all fields used to construct the `hashCode` are immutable.
