The code defines a candidate feature transformer called FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer that is used in the flexible injection pipeline of the larger project. The purpose of this transformer is to flip the prompt carousel tile, prompt injections, and prompt offset in module features of a given intermediate prompt. 

The code imports several packages and objects from other parts of the project, including onboardingthrift, IntermediatePrompt, BasePromptCandidate, PromptCarouselTileCandidate, Feature, FeatureMap, FeatureMapBuilder, and TransformerIdentifier. 

The FlipPromptCarouselTileFeature, FlipPromptInjectionsFeature, and FlipPromptOffsetInModuleFeature objects are defined as features that can be flipped by the transformer. FlipPromptCarouselTileFeature is a feature that takes a PromptCarouselTileCandidate and returns an optional onboardingthrift.Tile. FlipPromptInjectionsFeature is a feature that takes a BasePromptCandidate[String] and returns an onboardingthrift.Injection. FlipPromptOffsetInModuleFeature is a feature that takes a PromptCarouselTileCandidate and returns an optional integer. 

The FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer object extends the CandidateFeatureTransformer trait and overrides its identifier and features values. The transform method of the object takes an IntermediatePrompt as input and returns a FeatureMap that maps the three features to their corresponding values in the input. 

This code can be used in the larger project to transform intermediate prompts by flipping their features. For example, the following code snippet shows how to use the FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer to transform an intermediate prompt:

```
val inputPrompt: IntermediatePrompt = ...
val transformer: FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer = FlipCandidateFeatureTransformer
val outputFeatures: FeatureMap = transformer.transform(inputPrompt)
```

The outputFeatures FeatureMap will contain the flipped features of the input prompt.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a transformer component for a flexible injection pipeline in the product mixer component library. It transforms an `IntermediatePrompt` input into a `FeatureMap` output using three specific features.

2. What are the three features being used in this code and how do they work?
- The three features being used are `FlipPromptInjectionsFeature`, `FlipPromptOffsetInModuleFeature`, and `FlipPromptCarouselTileFeature`. They are all instances of the `Feature` class and are used to extract specific information from the `IntermediatePrompt` input and add it to the `FeatureMap` output.

3. What is the purpose of the `TransformerIdentifier` and how is it used in this code?
- The `TransformerIdentifier` is used to uniquely identify this transformer component. It is set to "FlipCandidateFeature" in this code and is used to create an instance of the `TransformerIdentifier` class in the `identifier` field. This identifier is used to reference this transformer component in other parts of the project.
