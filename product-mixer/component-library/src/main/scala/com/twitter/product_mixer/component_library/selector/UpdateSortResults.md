The code defines a Scala object and a case class that are used to sort results from a product mixer pipeline. The object `UpdateSortResults` has a single method `apply` that takes an `Ordering` object as input and returns a new instance of the `UpdateSortResults` case class. The `UpdateSortResults` case class takes a `SorterProvider` object and a `CandidateScope` object as input and extends the `Selector` trait. 

The `UpdateSortResults` case class is used to sort item and module results from a product mixer pipeline. The `SorterProvider` object is used to provide a `Sorter` object that is used to sort the results. The `pipelineScope` object is used to specify the scope of the pipeline. The `apply` method of the `UpdateSortResults` case class takes a `PipelineQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects as input. The `query` object is used to specify the query for the pipeline. The `remainingCandidates` object is used to specify the remaining candidates that have not been processed by the pipeline. The `result` object is used to specify the results that have been processed by the pipeline.

The `apply` method of the `UpdateSortResults` case class sorts the `result` object using the `Sorter` object provided by the `SorterProvider` object. The sorted `result` object is then returned as part of a `SelectorResult` object along with the `remainingCandidates` object.

This code is used in the larger product mixer pipeline project to sort the results of the pipeline based on a specified ordering. The `Ordering` object passed to the `apply` method of the `UpdateSortResults` object specifies the ordering to be used for sorting the results. An example of how to use this code is shown below:

```
val ordering = Ordering.by[CandidateWithDetails, Double](_.features.get(ScoreFeature) match {
  case Scored(score) => score
  case _ => Double.MinValue
}).reverse

val updateSortResults = UpdateSortResults(ordering)

val pipelineQuery = PipelineQuery()

val remainingCandidates = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)

val result = Seq(candidate4, candidate5, candidate6)

val selectorResult = updateSortResults(pipelineQuery, remainingCandidates, result)

val sortedResult = selectorResult.result
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for sorting item and module results based on a specified ordering.

2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method in the `UpdateSortResults` object?
- The input is an `Ordering[CandidateWithDetails]` and the output is a new instance of `UpdateSortResults`.

3. What is the purpose of the `sorterProvider` parameter in the `UpdateSortResults` case class?
- The `sorterProvider` parameter is used to provide a `Sorter` instance that will be used to sort the results based on the specified ordering.
