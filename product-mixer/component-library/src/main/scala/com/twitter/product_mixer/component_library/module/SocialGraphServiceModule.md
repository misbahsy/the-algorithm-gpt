The `SocialGraphServiceModule` is a module that provides a Thrift client for the `SocialGraphService`. The `SocialGraphService` is a service that provides functionality for managing social graphs. The module uses the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` and `MtlsClient` to create a Thrift client for the `SocialGraphService`. 

The `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` is a module that provides a client for a Thrift service. It uses the `MethodBuilder` class from the `finagle-thriftmux` library to create a client for the service. The `MethodBuilder` class provides a fluent API for building Thrift clients. The `MtlsClient` trait is a trait that provides support for mutual TLS authentication. Mutual TLS authentication is a security feature that requires both the client and server to authenticate each other using digital certificates.

The `SocialGraphServiceModule` provides a `SocialGraph` client for the `SocialGraphService`. The `SocialGraph` class is a class that provides functionality for managing social graphs. The `provideGizmoduckStitchClient` method is a method that creates a new instance of the `SocialGraph` class using the `SocialGraphService.MethodPerEndpoint` client provided by the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule`. The `Singleton` annotation is used to ensure that only one instance of the `SocialGraph` class is created.

The `configureMethodBuilder` method is a method that configures the `MethodBuilder` instance used by the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule`. In this case, the method sets the timeout for each request to 400 milliseconds.

Overall, the `SocialGraphServiceModule` provides a client for the `SocialGraphService` that can be used to manage social graphs. The module uses the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` and `MtlsClient` to create a secure Thrift client for the service. The `SocialGraph` class provides functionality for managing social graphs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code provides a module for a Thrift client that communicates with a SocialGraph service. It sets up a ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule and MtlsClient to handle communication with the service, and provides a method for creating a SocialGraph client.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several libraries, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, Twitter Finatra, and Twitter Stitch. It also depends on the SocialGraphService and SocialGraph classes.

3. What is the significance of the label and dest variables?
   - The label variable is used to identify the SocialGraphService module, while the dest variable specifies the endpoint for the service. In this case, the endpoint is "/s/socialgraph/socialgraph".
