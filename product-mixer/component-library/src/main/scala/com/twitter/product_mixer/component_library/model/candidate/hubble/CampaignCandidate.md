The `CampaignCandidate` class is a model that describes a "Campaign" from the Ads Management perspective. It extends the `UniversalNoun` class and has two fields: `id` and `adAccountId`. The `id` field is inherited from the `UniversalNoun` class and represents the campaign ID. The `adAccountId` field represents the ID of the ad account associated with the campaign.

The class has an `equals` method that is implemented for high performance. It checks for referential equality short circuit, cached hashcode equality short circuit, and field values are only checked if the hashCodes are equal to handle the unlikely case of a hashCode collision. The `canEqual` method is also implemented to check if the passed object is an instance of `CampaignCandidate`.

The `hashCode` method is also implemented to leverage domain-specific constraints to safely construct and cache the hashCode as a val, such that it is instantiated once on object construction. This prevents the need to recompute the hashCode on each hashCode() invocation, which is the behavior of the Scala compiler case class-generated hashCode() since it cannot make assumptions regarding field object mutability and hashCode implementations.

The `CampaignCandidate` object has an `apply` method that creates a new instance of the `CampaignCandidate` class with the given `id` and `adAccountId`.

This class is a part of a larger project that deals with Ads Management. It can be used to represent a campaign and its associated ad account. It can also be used to compare two campaign candidates for equality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the CampaignCandidate class and how is it used in the project?
- The CampaignCandidate class describes a "Campaign" from the Ads Management perspective and is used as a model for this type of data. It should always be preferred over other variants.

2. What is the significance of the canEqual and equals methods in this class?
- The canEqual method checks if the given object is an instance of CampaignCandidate, while the equals method provides a high-performance implementation of the equality check between two CampaignCandidate objects. It leverages referential equality short circuit, cached hashcode equality short circuit, and field values checking.

3. Why is the hashCode field cached as a val in this class?
- The hashCode field is cached as a val to prevent the need to recompute the hashCode on each hashCode() invocation. This is because the Scala compiler case class-generated hashCode() cannot make assumptions regarding field object mutability and hashCode implementations. However, caching the hashCode is only safe if all of the fields used to construct the hashCode are immutable.
