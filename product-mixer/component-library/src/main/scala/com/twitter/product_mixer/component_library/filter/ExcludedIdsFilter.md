The code defines a filter component called `ExcludedIdsFilter` that is used to filter out candidates based on their IDs. The component takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Candidate`. The `Query` type parameter is a subtype of `PipelineQuery` and `HasExcludedIds`, while the `Candidate` type parameter is a subtype of `UniversalNoun` with a `Long` identifier.

The `ExcludedIdsFilter` class extends the `Filter` trait, which defines a filter operation that takes a query and a sequence of candidates and returns a `FilterResult`. The `FilterResult` contains two sequences of candidates: `kept` and `removed`. The `kept` sequence contains the candidates that passed the filter, while the `removed` sequence contains the candidates that failed the filter.

The `ExcludedIdsFilter` class overrides the `identifier` method of the `Filter` trait to provide a unique identifier for the filter. The identifier is used to distinguish the filter from other filters in the pipeline.

The `ExcludedIdsFilter` class also overrides the `apply` method of the `Filter` trait to implement the filter operation. The `apply` method takes a query and a sequence of candidates and returns a `Stitch` that contains a `FilterResult`. The `Stitch` is a monadic type that allows for asynchronous and parallel execution of operations.

The `apply` method first partitions the candidates into two sequences: `kept` and `removed`. The `kept` sequence contains the candidates whose IDs are not in the `excludedIds` field of the query, while the `removed` sequence contains the candidates whose IDs are in the `excludedIds` field of the query.

The `apply` method then creates a `FilterResult` object with the `kept` and `removed` sequences and returns it wrapped in a `Stitch` using the `value` method.

This filter component can be used in a larger pipeline to filter out candidates based on their IDs. For example, it can be used to exclude candidates that have already been shown to a user in a recommendation system. The `excludedIds` field of the query can be populated with the IDs of the candidates that have already been shown to the user, and the `ExcludedIdsFilter` component can be used to filter out those candidates from the recommendation list.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
   - This code is a filter component for the product mixer component library in the Twitter project. It is used to filter out candidates with excluded IDs from a pipeline query.
2. What are the input and output types for this filter component? 
   - The input types are a pipeline query with excluded IDs and a sequence of candidates with features. The output type is a filter result containing the kept and removed candidates.
3. What is the Stitch library used for in this code? 
   - The Stitch library is used to wrap the filter result in a monadic context, allowing for easier composition with other components in the pipeline.
