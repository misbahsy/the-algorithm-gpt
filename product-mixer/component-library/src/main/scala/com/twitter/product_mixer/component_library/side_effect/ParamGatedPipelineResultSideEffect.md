This code defines a Scala class called `ParamGatedPipelineResultSideEffect` that extends the `PipelineResultSideEffect` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to conditionally execute a side effect based on the value of a `Param` object. 

The `ParamGatedPipelineResultSideEffect` class takes two type parameters: `Query` and `ResultType`. `Query` represents the domain model for the query or request, while `ResultType` represents the type of the result that the side effect produces. 

The class has two constructor parameters: `enabledParam` and `sideEffect`. `enabledParam` is a `Param[Boolean]` object that is used to turn the side effect on and off. `sideEffect` is the underlying side effect that will be executed when `enabledParam` is true. 

The class implements the `PipelineResultSideEffect.Conditionally` trait, which provides a `onlyIf` method that determines whether the side effect should be executed based on the value of `enabledParam`. If `enabledParam` is true, the `apply` method of the underlying `sideEffect` is called. 

The `ParamGatedPipelineResultSideEffect` class is sealed, which means that it cannot be extended outside of its own file. This is a way of ensuring that all possible implementations of the class are defined in the same file. 

The `ParamGatedPipelineResultSideEffect` object provides a factory method called `apply` that takes the same two parameters as the class constructor. This method returns an instance of `ParamGatedPipelineResultSideEffect` that is either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the type of the underlying `sideEffect`. 

Overall, this code provides a way to conditionally execute a side effect based on the value of a `Param` object. This could be useful in a larger project where different side effects need to be executed based on different parameters. For example, a search engine might use this code to execute different side effects based on the user's search query.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a sealed case class and an object for a PipelineResultSideEffect with Conditionally based on a Param. It is part of the component library for side effects in the larger project.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in an instance of PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs[Query, ResultType] and returns a Stitch[Unit].

3. What is the significance of the `Conditionally` trait and how is it used in this code?
- The `Conditionally` trait is used to define a conditional behavior for the `onlyIf` method. It is used in this code to determine whether the underlying side effect should be run based on the value of the `enabledParam`.
