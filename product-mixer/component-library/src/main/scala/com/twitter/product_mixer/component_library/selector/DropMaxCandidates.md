[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/component-library/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/component_library/selector/DropMaxCandidates.scala)

The code defines a Selector component for limiting the number of candidates returned by a pipeline query based on a maximum value provided by a MaxSelector. The Selector is used to control the number of item and module candidates returned by a pipeline query. 

The MaxSelector trait defines a method that takes a pipeline query, a sequence of remaining candidates, and a sequence of already selected candidates, and returns an integer value representing the maximum number of candidates that can be selected. The DropMaxCandidates object provides three apply methods that create instances of the DropMaxCandidates Selector based on different parameters. The first apply method takes a single candidate pipeline identifier and a maximum selections parameter, the second apply method takes a set of candidate pipeline identifiers and a maximum selections parameter, and the third apply method takes a pipeline scope and a maximum selections parameter. 

The DropMaxCandidates Selector takes a pipeline query, a sequence of remaining candidates, and a sequence of already selected candidates as input, and returns a SelectorResult object that contains a sequence of remaining candidates limited by the maximum number of selections provided by the MaxSelector, and the original sequence of already selected candidates. The SelectorResult object is used by other Selector components in the pipeline to further filter and order the candidates. 

The Selector is used in the larger project to control the number of candidates returned by a pipeline query, and to ensure that the number of candidates is limited to a maximum value specified by the MaxSelector. The Selector can be used in conjunction with other Selector components to further filter and order the candidates returned by the pipeline query. 

Example usage:

```
val maxSelector = new MaxSelector[PipelineQuery] {
  override def apply(
    query: PipelineQuery,
    remainingCandidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails],
    result: Seq[CandidateWithDetails]
  ): Int = {
    query.params.getOrElse("maxSelections", 10)
  }
}

val dropMaxCandidates = DropMaxCandidates(
  SpecificPipeline(CandidatePipelineIdentifier("pipeline1")),
  Param("maxSelections", 5)
)

val query = PipelineQuery(Seq(CandidatePipelineIdentifier("pipeline1")))
val remainingCandidates = Seq(
  CandidateWithDetails("item1", "module1"),
  CandidateWithDetails("item2", "module1"),
  CandidateWithDetails("item3", "module1"),
  CandidateWithDetails("item4", "module1"),
  CandidateWithDetails("item5", "module1")
)

val result = Seq(
  CandidateWithDetails("item6", "module1"),
  CandidateWithDetails("item7", "module1")
)

val selectorResult = dropMaxCandidates(query, remainingCandidates, result)
// selectorResult contains remainingCandidates limited to 5 items and result unchanged
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the MaxSelector trait and how is it used in this code?
- The MaxSelector trait defines a method that takes in a query, a sequence of candidate details, and a sequence of selected candidates, and returns an integer representing the maximum number of candidates that can be selected. It is used in the DropMaxCandidates Selector to limit the number of candidates returned by a pipeline based on the value provided by the MaxSelector.

2. How does the DropMaxCandidates Selector work and what does it limit?
- The DropMaxCandidates Selector limits the number of item and module candidates returned by a pipeline based on the value provided by the MaxSelector. It takes in a pipeline scope and a MaxSelector instance, and returns a SelectorResult containing a limited sequence of remaining candidates and a sequence of selected candidates.

3. What is the purpose of the apply methods in the DropMaxCandidates object?
- The apply methods in the DropMaxCandidates object provide convenience constructors for creating instances of the DropMaxCandidates Selector. They take in different combinations of candidate pipelines, pipeline scopes, and MaxSelector parameters, and return a new instance of the DropMaxCandidates Selector.
