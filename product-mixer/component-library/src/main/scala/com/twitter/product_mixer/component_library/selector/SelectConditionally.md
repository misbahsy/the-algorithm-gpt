The code defines a trait and a case class for conditionally selecting a set of candidates based on a given query. The `SelectConditionally` case class takes two arguments: a `selector` of type `Selector[Query]` and an `includeSelector` of type `IncludeSelector[Query]`. The `selector` is the actual selector that will be applied to the candidates if the `includeSelector` resolves to true. The `includeSelector` is a trait that defines a method `apply` which takes a `query` of type `Query`, a sequence of `remainingCandidates` of type `Seq[CandidateWithDetails]`, and a sequence of `result` of type `Seq[CandidateWithDetails]` and returns a boolean. If the `includeSelector` returns true, the `selector` is applied to the candidates, otherwise the `selector` is a no-op.

The `SelectConditionally` case class overrides the `apply` method of the `Selector` trait and checks if the `includeSelector` returns true for the given `query`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result`. If it does, the `selector` is applied to the candidates, otherwise a `SelectorResult` is returned with the `remainingCandidates` and `result` unchanged.

The `SelectConditionally` object provides several factory methods for creating instances of `SelectConditionally`. The `apply` method takes a sequence of `selectors` of type `Seq[Selector[Query]]` and an `includeSelector` of type `IncludeSelector[Query]` and returns a sequence of `Selector[Query]` where each `selector` is wrapped in a `SelectConditionally` instance with the given `includeSelector`. The `paramGated` method takes a `selector` of type `Selector[Query]` and an `enabledParam` of type `Param[Boolean]` and returns a `SelectConditionally` instance where the `includeSelector` checks if the `enabledParam` is true for the given `query`. The `paramGated` method also has an overloaded version that takes a sequence of `selectors` and an `enabledParam` and returns a sequence of `Selector[Query]` where each `selector` is wrapped in a `SelectConditionally` instance with the given `enabledParam`. The `paramNotGated` method is similar to `paramGated` but checks if the `enabledParamToInvert` is false for the given `query`. It also has an overloaded version that takes a sequence of `selectors` and an `enabledParamToInvert` and returns a sequence of `Selector[Query]` where each `selector` is wrapped in a `SelectConditionally` instance with the given `enabledParamToInvert`.

This code is likely used in the larger project to conditionally apply a set of selectors to a set of candidates based on a given query. The `includeSelector` can be used to filter out candidates that do not meet certain criteria before applying the `selector`. The factory methods provide a convenient way to create instances of `SelectConditionally` with different `includeSelector` conditions. For example, the `paramGated` method can be used to create a `SelectConditionally` instance that only applies the `selector` if a certain parameter is true for the given query. This can be useful for implementing feature flags or other conditional logic.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IncludeSelector` trait?
- The `IncludeSelector` trait defines a method that determines whether a selector should be applied to a query based on the remaining candidates and the current result.

2. What is the purpose of the `SelectConditionally` case class?
- The `SelectConditionally` case class is a selector that runs another selector only if the `IncludeSelector` resolves to true, otherwise it returns the remaining candidates and the current result.

3. What is the purpose of the `paramGated` and `paramNotGated` methods?
- The `paramGated` and `paramNotGated` methods are factory methods that create `SelectConditionally` instances based on whether a certain parameter is enabled or not. The former creates a `SelectConditionally` instance that runs a selector only if the parameter is enabled, while the latter creates a `SelectConditionally` instance that runs a selector only if the parameter is disabled.
