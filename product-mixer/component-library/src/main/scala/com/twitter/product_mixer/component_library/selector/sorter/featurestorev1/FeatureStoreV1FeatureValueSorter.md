The `FeatureStoreV1FeatureValueSorter` object provides methods for sorting candidates based on a Feature Store v1 feature value. It is a version of the `FeatureValueSorter` class that is specific to the Feature Store v1. 

The object contains four methods: `ascending`, `descending`, `ascending` with a default value, and `descending` with a default value. All of these methods take a Feature Store v1 feature as input and return a `SorterProvider`. The `SorterProvider` is used to sort candidates based on the feature value. 

The `ascending` method sorts candidates in ascending order based on the Feature Store v1 feature value. If the feature value is missing or failed, the method uses an inferred default value based on the type of the feature value. For numeric values, the default value is the minimum value (e.g. Long.MinValue, Double.MinValue). The `ascending` method with a default value sorts candidates in ascending order based on the Feature Store v1 feature value and uses the provided default value if the feature value is missing or failed. 

The `descending` method sorts candidates in descending order based on the Feature Store v1 feature value. If the feature value is missing or failed, the method uses an inferred default value based on the type of the feature value. For numeric values, the default value is the maximum value (e.g. Long.MaxValue, Double.MaxValue). The `descending` method with a default value sorts candidates in descending order based on the Feature Store v1 feature value and uses the provided default value if the feature value is missing or failed. 

This object is used in the larger project to sort candidates based on Feature Store v1 feature values. For example, if the project is recommending products to users, the `FeatureStoreV1FeatureValueSorter` object can be used to sort the products based on their features (e.g. price, rating, popularity) to provide the most relevant recommendations to the user. 

Example usage:

```
val feature: FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeature[PipelineQuery, Product, _ <: EntityId, Double] = ???
val sorterProvider: SorterProvider = FeatureStoreV1FeatureValueSorter.ascending(feature)
val sortedProducts: Seq[Product] = products.sortBy(sorterProvider.sorter)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code provides sorting functionality for a feature store v1 version of a product mixer component library selector. It likely fits into a larger project related to product mixing and selection.

2. What types of features can be sorted using this code?
- This code can sort Feature Store v1 features with an Ordering context bound.

3. What is the purpose of the `typeTag` parameter in the `ascending` and `descending` methods?
- The `typeTag` parameter allows for inferring a default value from the FeatureValue type, which is used if the feature failed or is missing.
