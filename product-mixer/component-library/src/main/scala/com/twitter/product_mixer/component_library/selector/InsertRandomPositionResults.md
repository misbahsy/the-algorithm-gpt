The `InsertRandomPositionResults` object and `InsertRandomPositionResults` class are part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.selector` package. The purpose of this code is to insert candidates from the `remainingCandidates` side into a random position between the specified indices (inclusive). The `InsertRandomPositionResults` class is a selector that takes a `pipelineScope`, `remainingCandidateOrder`, `startIndex`, `endIndex`, and `random` as parameters. It returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the remaining candidates and the merged result.

The `InsertRandomPositionResults` object contains a private method called `randomIndices` that returns an iterator containing random indices between `startIndex` and `endIndex` + `n`, where `n` is the number of times `next` has been called on the iterator without duplication. The method keeps track of the available indices and ensures fairness, which duplicate indices could otherwise skew.

The `InsertRandomPositionResults` class has two possible values for `remainingCandidateOrder`: `UnstableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates` and `StableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates`. If `UnstableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates` is used, the candidates from the `remainingCandidates` side will be inserted in a random order into the `result`. If `StableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates` is used, the candidates from the `remainingCandidates` side will be inserted in their original order into the `result`.

The `InsertRandomPositionResults` class applies the `randomIndices` method to the `result` to get a random index iterator. The iterator is then used to insert the candidates from the `remainingCandidates` side into the `result` at the random indices. The `mergedResult` is returned as the result.

This code is used in the larger project to randomly insert candidates into a result. It can be used to add variety to the results and improve the user experience. For example, if a user is searching for a product, the results can be randomized to show different products at the top of the list each time the user searches. This can help the user discover new products and keep the search results fresh.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InsertRandomPositionResults` object and its `randomIndices` method?
- The `InsertRandomPositionResults` object provides a way to insert candidates into a result in a random position between specified indices. The `randomIndices` method generates an iterator of random indices to use for insertion.

2. What is the difference between `UnstableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates` and `StableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates`?
- `UnstableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates` means that candidates from the `remainingCandidates` side will be inserted in a random order into the `result`, while `StableOrderingOfInsertedCandidates` means that candidates will be inserted in their original order into the `result`.

3. What is the purpose of the `InsertRandomPositionResults` class and how does it use the `InsertRandomPositionResults` object?
- The `InsertRandomPositionResults` class is a selector that uses the `InsertRandomPositionResults` object to insert candidates into a result in a random position between specified indices. It takes in a pipeline scope, candidate order, start and end indices, and a random number generator as parameters, and returns a `SelectorResult` containing the remaining candidates and the merged result.
