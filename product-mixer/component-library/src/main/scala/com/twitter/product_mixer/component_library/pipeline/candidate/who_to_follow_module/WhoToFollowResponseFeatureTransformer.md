This code defines a feature transformer for the Who To Follow module of the Twitter product mixer. The purpose of this module is to recommend Twitter users to follow based on various features such as ad impressions, social text, and machine learning prediction scores. 

The code imports several libraries and defines five feature objects: AdImpressionFeature, HermitContextTypeFeature, SocialTextFeature, TrackingTokenFeature, and ScoreFeature. These features are used to represent the various attributes of a recommended user that will be used to generate the recommendation. 

The main object in this code is the WhoToFollowResponseFeatureTransformer, which is a candidate feature transformer for the RecommendedUser class. This transformer takes a RecommendedUser object as input and returns a FeatureMap object that contains the values of the various features for that user. 

The transform method of the transformer takes a RecommendedUser object as input and uses the FeatureMapBuilder to create a FeatureMap object. The FeatureMap object contains the values of the various features for the input user. For example, the AdImpressionFeature is set to the value of the adImpression field of the input user, the HermitContextTypeFeature is set to the value of the contextType field of the reason field of the input user, and so on. 

This transformer is used in the larger Who To Follow module of the Twitter product mixer to generate recommendations for Twitter users to follow. The various features defined in this code are used to represent the attributes of the recommended users, and the transformer is used to convert the RecommendedUser objects into FeatureMap objects that can be used by the recommendation engine. 

Example usage:

```
val user = t.RecommendedUser(adImpression = Some(ad.AdImpression()), 
                              reason = Some(h.Reason(contextType = Some(h.ContextType())), 
                              socialText = Some("Follow me!"), 
                              trackingToken = Some("12345"), 
                              mlPredictionScore = Some(0.8))
val featureMap = WhoToFollowResponseFeatureTransformer.transform(user)
```

In this example, a RecommendedUser object is created with some values for the various fields. The transform method of the WhoToFollowResponseFeatureTransformer is then called with this object as input, which returns a FeatureMap object containing the values of the various features for this user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a feature transformer for the WhoToFollow module of the Twitter product mixer. It transforms a recommended user into a feature map that includes information such as ad impressions, social text, and prediction scores.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
- This code depends on several Thrift-generated Scala libraries for ad serving, Hermit context types, and people discovery APIs. These libraries are imported and used to extract relevant information from the recommended user input.

3. How is the output of this code used in the larger context of the WhoToFollow module?
- The output of this code is a feature map that is used as input to other components of the WhoToFollow module, such as the candidate generator and the candidate scorer. The features extracted by this transformer are used to inform the ranking and selection of recommended users for display to Twitter users.
