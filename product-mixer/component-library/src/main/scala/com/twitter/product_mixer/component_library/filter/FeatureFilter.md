The `FeatureFilter` object in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.filter` package provides functionality to build a filter that keeps or removes candidates based on the presence and value of a provided Boolean feature. 

The `fromFeature` method is overloaded and provides two ways to build a filter. The first method takes a `Feature` object and uses its name as the `FilterIdentifier` to build a filter. The second method takes a `FilterIdentifier` and a `Feature` object and builds a filter using the provided identifier. Both methods return a `Filter` object that can be used to filter candidates in a pipeline.

The `Filter` object returned by the `fromFeature` method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects as input. The `PipelineQuery` is not used in this implementation. The `CandidateWithFeatures` object contains a candidate and its associated features. The filter uses the provided `Feature` object to determine whether a candidate should be kept or removed. If the feature is present and true, the candidate is kept. Otherwise, it is removed. The filter returns a `FilterResult` object that contains two sequences of candidates: `kept` and `removed`.

This code can be used in the larger project to build filters that keep or remove candidates based on the presence and value of a Boolean feature. For example, if there is a feature that indicates whether a candidate is available, a filter can be built to keep only the available candidates. This can be useful in various applications such as recommendation systems, search engines, and ad targeting. 

Here is an example of how to use the `fromFeature` method to build a filter that keeps candidates with an `isAvailable` feature set to true:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.filter.FeatureFilter
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.UniversalNoun
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.FilterIdentifier
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery

case class Product(isAvailable: Boolean)

val isAvailableFeature = Feature[Product, Boolean]("isAvailable", _.isAvailable)

val filter = FeatureFilter.fromFeature(
  FilterIdentifier("AvailableProducts"),
  feature = isAvailableFeature
)

val candidates = Seq(
  UniversalNoun(Product(true)),
  UniversalNoun(Product(false)),
  UniversalNoun(Product(true))
)

val query = PipelineQuery()

val result = filter(query, candidates)

println(result.kept) // prints: List(Product(true), Product(true))
println(result.removed) // prints: List(Product(false))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Scala object called `FeatureFilter` that contains two methods for building a filter based on a provided feature.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several classes and traits from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core` and `com.twitter.stitch` packages.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects as input, and returns a `Stitch` object containing a `FilterResult` object with two sequences of `Candidate` objects: `kept` and `removed`.
