This code defines the TweetCandidate model, which is used to represent a tweet in the larger project. The model is a subclass of UniversalNoun, which is a common interface for all candidate models in the project. The TweetCandidate model is marked as final, meaning it cannot be extended by other classes. 

The model has a single field, id, which is a Long representing the tweet ID. The equals() and hashCode() methods are overridden to provide a high-performance implementation that takes advantage of referential equality and cached hashcode equality short circuits. The hashCode is cached as a val to prevent recomputation on each hashCode() invocation. 

The code also defines two Feature objects, TweetAuthorIdFeature and IsPinnedFeature, which are used to extract additional features from the tweet candidate. TweetAuthorIdFeature is used to extract the author user ID of the tweet, while IsPinnedFeature is used to determine whether the tweet should be pinned when marshalled to URT. 

Overall, this code provides a canonical model for representing tweets in the larger project, with additional features that can be extracted using the defined Feature objects. 

Example usage:

```
val tweet = TweetCandidate(1234567890L)
val authorId = TweetAuthorIdFeature.extract(tweet)
val isPinned = IsPinnedFeature.extract(tweet)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseTweetCandidate` trait and how is it used?
- The `BaseTweetCandidate` trait is used as a base model for all tweet candidates and provides a `Long` id. It is extended by the `TweetCandidate` class.
2. What is the purpose of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in the `TweetCandidate` class?
- The `equals` method is used to check if two `TweetCandidate` objects are equal, while the `hashCode` method is used to generate a hash code for the object. The implementation of these methods is optimized for performance.
3. What are the `TweetAuthorIdFeature` and `IsPinnedFeature` objects used for?
- `TweetAuthorIdFeature` is a feature that provides the author user ID of a tweet candidate, while `IsPinnedFeature` is a feature that indicates whether a tweet should be pinned when marshalled to URT. These features can be added to a candidate's feature map.
