The code defines two cursor models, `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor` and `UnorderedExcludeIdsCursor`, that can be used for cursoring over an unordered candidate source. The purpose of these cursors is to allow for pagination of large datasets by returning a cursor that can be used to fetch the next set of results. 

The `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor` model is used when the candidate source is unbounded (unlimited page size) and an impression store is used to catch up on events that may have been missed. The cursor contains a list of IDs to exclude from the candidate list, which is limited to a max size via a circular buffer implementation. This cursor is typically used for bounded (limited page size) products or unbounded products in conjunction with an impression store.

The `UnorderedExcludeIdsCursor` model is used when the candidate source is bounded and does not require an impression store. This cursor also contains a list of IDs to exclude from the candidate list.

Both cursor models extend their respective pipeline cursor classes, `UrtPipelineCursor` and `PipelineCursor`, which provide additional functionality for cursoring over candidate sources.

Overall, these cursor models provide a way to efficiently paginate through large datasets by excluding previously fetched results and returning a cursor that can be used to fetch the next set of results. They are an important component of the larger project's data processing pipeline. 

Example usage:

```
val cursor = UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor(0, Seq(1, 2, 3))
val results = fetchData(cursor)
val nextCursor = results.nextCursor
val nextResults = fetchData(nextCursor)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor and how is it different from other cursor models?
   
   The UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor is a cursor model used for cursoring over an unordered candidate source. It differs from other cursor models in that it includes an excludedIds list that can be used to exclude certain elements from the candidate list.

2. How is the excludedIds list limited in size and what is the purpose of this limitation?
   
   The excludedIds list is limited in size via a circular buffer implementation, which is unioned with the impression store IDs when filtering. This is done to prevent the excludedIds list from growing indefinitely due to payload size constraints.

3. What is the purpose of the UnorderedExcludeIdsCursor and how does it differ from the UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor?
   
   The UnorderedExcludeIdsCursor is a cursor model used for cursoring over an unordered candidate source, similar to the UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor. However, it does not include an initialSortIndex parameter and is not a URT cursor model.
