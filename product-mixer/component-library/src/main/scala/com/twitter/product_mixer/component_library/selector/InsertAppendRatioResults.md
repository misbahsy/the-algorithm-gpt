The `InsertAppendRatioResults` class is a selector that randomly selects candidates from a set of pipelines and adds them to a result set based on the ratio assigned to each bucket. The class takes in a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s, a `Bucketer`, a map of `Bucket`s to `Param[Double]` ratios, and a `Random` object. 

When the `apply` method is called, the remaining candidates are grouped by whether they are from a selected pipeline or not and whether they belong to a bucket in the ratio map. The candidates that do not belong to a selected pipeline are added to the `otherCandidates` list, while the candidates that do not belong to a bucket in the ratio map are added to the `notABucketInThePattern` list. 

The remaining candidates are then iterated over until all remaining candidates are for a single bucket. The selector randomly selects a bucket to take a candidate from based on the ratio assigned to each bucket. The selector keeps track of the sum of all ratios so that it can look only at random values between 0 and that sum. The selector then adds the selected candidate to the `newResult` list. If there are no more candidates in the selected bucket, the ratio assigned to that bucket is removed from the ratio map, and the sum of all ratios is updated accordingly. 

Once there is only one source remaining, the selector inserts the remaining candidates in bulk. The selector then returns a `SelectorResult` object containing the `otherCandidates`, `result`, and `remainingCandidates`.

This selector can be used in the larger project to randomly select candidates from a set of pipelines and add them to a result set based on the ratio assigned to each bucket. For example, if there are two pipelines, A and B, and the ratio assigned to A is 0.8 and the ratio assigned to B is 0.2, then candidates will randomly be added to the results with an 80% chance of any candidate being from A and a 20% chance of any candidate being from B. The selector ensures that all candidates from all `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s provided will end up in the result.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it work?
- This code is a selector component for selecting candidates and adding them according to the ratio assigned for each bucket. It randomly adds candidates to the results with a chance proportional to the ratio assigned to each bucket. If there are no more candidates from a given bucket, it is skipped. The end result is all candidates from all candidate pipelines provided will end up in the result.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `query` of type `Query`, a sequence of `remainingCandidates` of type `Seq[CandidateWithDetails]`, and a sequence of `result` of type `Seq[CandidateWithDetails]`. It returns a `SelectorResult` object containing the remaining candidates and the new result.

3. What is the purpose of the `findBucketToTakeFrom` method?
- The `findBucketToTakeFrom` method iterates through the `bucketRatiosIterator` until it finds the bucket that corresponds with the current `randomValue`. It returns the corresponding bucket. This method is used to randomly select a bucket based on the ratio assigned to each bucket.
