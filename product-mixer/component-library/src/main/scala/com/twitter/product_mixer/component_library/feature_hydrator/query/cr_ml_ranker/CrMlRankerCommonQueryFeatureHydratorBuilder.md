The code defines a class called `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydratorBuilder` that builds a query hydrator for the Common Features of a given Query from CR ML Ranker. The purpose of this class is to later use this query hydrator to call CR ML Ranker for scoring using the desired `RankingConfigBuilder` for building the ranking configuration. 

The class is annotated with `@Singleton` and is injected with an instance of `t.CrMLRanker.MethodPerEndpoint` which is used to build the query hydrator. The `build` method takes a `RankingConfigBuilder` as input and returns an instance of `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydrator` which is the query hydrator built using the `crMlRanker` instance and the `rankingConfigSelector`.

This code is likely a part of a larger project that involves using CR ML Ranker to score queries. The `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydratorBuilder` class is responsible for building the query hydrator that is used to retrieve Common Features for a given Query from CR ML Ranker. The `RankingConfigBuilder` is used to build the ranking configuration that is used to score the query using CR ML Ranker. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:

```scala
val crMlRanker: t.CrMLRanker.MethodPerEndpoint = // initialize CR ML Ranker instance
val rankingConfigBuilder: RankingConfigBuilder = // initialize RankingConfigBuilder instance

val queryFeatureHydratorBuilder = new CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydratorBuilder(crMlRanker)
val queryFeatureHydrator = queryFeatureHydratorBuilder.build(rankingConfigBuilder)

// use queryFeatureHydrator to retrieve Common Features for a given Query and score it using CR ML Ranker
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code builds a query hydrator that hydrates Common Features for a given Query from CR ML Ranker to be later used to call CR ML Ranker for scoring using the desired RankingConfigBuilder for building the ranking config.

2. What is the role of the `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydratorBuilder` class?
- The `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydratorBuilder` class is responsible for building a `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydrator` object that can hydrate Common Features for a given Query from CR ML Ranker.

3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor that will be used by the dependency injection framework to create an instance of the class.
