The code defines a model class called `ShowAlertCandidate` that extends the `UniversalNoun` class. This model is used to represent a candidate for a show alert. The `ShowAlertCandidate` class has two fields: `id` and `userIds`. The `id` field is a string that represents the unique identifier for the candidate, while the `userIds` field is a sequence of long integers that represents the user IDs associated with the candidate.

The `ShowAlertCandidate` class has an `equals` method that is used to compare two instances of the class for equality. The method first checks if the two instances are the same object, then checks if their hash codes are equal, and finally checks if their `id` and `userIds` fields are equal. The `ShowAlertCandidate` class also has a `hashCode` method that is used to compute the hash code of an instance of the class. The hash code is computed using the `id` and `userIds` fields.

The `ShowAlertCandidate` class has two notes that provide additional information about the class. The first note explains that any additional fields should be added as a `Feature` on the candidate's `FeatureMap`. The second note explains that the class should always remain `final` and that the `equals` method must be updated if the `final` modifier is removed.

The `ShowAlertCandidate` class has a companion object that defines a factory method called `apply`. The `apply` method is used to create a new instance of the `ShowAlertCandidate` class with the given `id` and `userIds`.

Overall, the `ShowAlertCandidate` class is a simple model class that represents a candidate for a show alert. It provides methods for comparing instances of the class for equality and computing the hash code of an instance of the class. The class is designed to be immutable and should always remain `final`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShowAlertCandidate` class?
- The `ShowAlertCandidate` class is a model for a canonical candidate with additional fields that can be added as a feature on the candidate's feature map.

2. Why is the `equals` method implemented in a specific way?
- The `equals` method is implemented in a high-performance way that leverages referential equality short circuit, cached hashcode equality short circuit, and field values that are only checked if the hashCodes are equal to handle the unlikely case of a hashCode collision.

3. Why is the `hashCode` cached as a val?
- The `hashCode` is cached as a val to prevent the need to recompute the hashCode on each hashCode() invocation, which is the behavior of the Scala compiler case class-generated hashCode(). This is safe if all of the fields used to construct the hashCode are immutable.
