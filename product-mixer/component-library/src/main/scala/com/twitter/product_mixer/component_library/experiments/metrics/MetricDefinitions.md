The code defines classes and objects for creating and managing metrics in a larger project. Metrics are used to measure and track various aspects of the project's performance. 

The `MetricDefinition` trait is the base class for all metric definitions. It defines two methods: `toCsvField` and `metricDefinitionType`. The `toCsvField` method returns a sequence of strings that represent the metric definition in CSV format. The `metricDefinitionType` method returns a string that identifies the type of metric definition. 

There are four classes that extend the `MetricDefinition` trait: `NamedPatternMetricDefinition`, `StrainerMetricDefinition`, `LambdaMetricDefinition`, and `BucketRatioMetricDefinition`. 

The `NamedPatternMetricDefinition` class represents a metric that matches a regular expression pattern. It takes a sequence of strings as input, which represents the regex pattern for the metric. 

The `StrainerMetricDefinition` class represents a metric that filters client events. It takes a string as input, which represents the filter expression. 

The `LambdaMetricDefinition` class represents a metric that maps client events to a double value using a Scala function. It takes a string as input, which represents the Scala function. 

The `BucketRatioMetricDefinition` class represents a metric that calculates the ratio of two metrics. It takes two strings as input, which represent the numerator and denominator metrics. 

The `Metric` case class represents a metric with a globally unique name and a metric definition. It has a companion object that defines a `fromLine` method, which creates a new `Metric` object from a semicolon-separated line string. The line string must have at least two parts separated by semicolon, where the first part is the metric expression, the second part is the metric name, and the third part (optional) is the metric definition type. The `fromLine` method returns a `Metric` object that has the specified name and metric definition. 

Overall, this code provides a framework for defining and managing metrics in a larger project. It allows developers to create different types of metrics and track their performance using a globally unique name. Here is an example of how to create a `Metric` object:

```
val metric = Metric("metric_name", NamedPatternMetricDefinition(Seq("regex_pattern")))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the MetricDefinition object and its SingleQuote and DoubleQuote values?
- The MetricDefinition object contains constants for single and double quotes. These are used to replace single quotes in the StrainerMetricDefinition and LambdaMetricDefinition classes to avoid CSV formatting issues.

2. What is the purpose of the Metric class and its fromLine method?
- The Metric class represents a named metric with a specific definition. The fromLine method is used to parse a semicolon-separated line string and create a new Metric object from it.

3. What types of metric definitions are supported by this code?
- This code supports four types of metric definitions: NamedPatternMetricDefinition, StrainerMetricDefinition, LambdaMetricDefinition, and BucketRatioMetricDefinition.
