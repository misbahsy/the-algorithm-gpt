The code defines a Scala case class called `DropAllCandidates` that extends the `Selector` trait. The purpose of this class is to drop all candidates on the `remainingCandidates` side that are in the `pipelineScope`. The `pipelineScope` is an instance of the `CandidateScope` class, which is defined in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common` package. The `CandidateScope` class represents the scope of a pipeline, which is a set of candidates that are eligible for selection by the pipeline.

The `DropAllCandidates` class takes an optional `pipelineScope` parameter in its constructor, which defaults to `AllPipelines`. The `AllPipelines` object is an instance of the `CandidateScope` class that represents all pipelines. This means that if no `pipelineScope` is specified, all candidates will be dropped.

The `apply` method of the `DropAllCandidates` class takes three parameters: a `PipelineQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the result of the selection process so far. The method first partitions the `remainingCandidates` into two sequences: `inScope` and `outOfScope`. The `inScope` sequence contains all candidates that are in the `pipelineScope`, while the `outOfScope` sequence contains all candidates that are not in the `pipelineScope`. The method then returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the `outOfScope` sequence as the new `remainingCandidates` and the original `result` sequence.

This class can be used in the larger project as a simple filter to drop candidates based only on the `CandidateScope`. It can also be used as a placeholder when templating out a new pipeline. For example, if a new pipeline is being created and no candidates have been selected yet, the `DropAllCandidates` class can be used to drop all candidates until the pipeline is fully defined. 

Example usage:

```
val pipelineScope = CandidateScope(Seq("pipeline1", "pipeline2"))
val remainingCandidates = Seq(
  CandidateWithDetails("candidate1", Map("pipeline" -> "pipeline1")),
  CandidateWithDetails("candidate2", Map("pipeline" -> "pipeline2")),
  CandidateWithDetails("candidate3", Map("pipeline" -> "pipeline3"))
)
val result = Seq.empty[CandidateWithDetails]

val dropAllCandidates = DropAllCandidates(pipelineScope)
val selectorResult = dropAllCandidates.apply(PipelineQuery(), remainingCandidates, result)

println(selectorResult.remainingCandidates)
// Output: Seq(CandidateWithDetails("candidate3", Map("pipeline" -> "pipeline3")))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DropAllCandidates` class?
   - The `DropAllCandidates` class drops all candidates on the `remainingCandidates` side which are in the `pipelineScope`.
2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?
   - The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` for `remainingCandidates`, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` for `result`. It returns a `SelectorResult` object.
3. What is the `pipelineScope` parameter and how is it used?
   - The `pipelineScope` parameter is an instance of the `CandidateScope` class and is used to partition the `remainingCandidates` into those that are in the scope and those that are out of scope. The candidates that are out of scope are returned as part of the `SelectorResult`.
