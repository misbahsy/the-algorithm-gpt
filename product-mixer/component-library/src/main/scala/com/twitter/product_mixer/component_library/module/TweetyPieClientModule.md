The TweetyPieClientModule is a module that provides a client implementation for the TweetyPie Thrift and Stitch service. It is designed to be used as a dependency in a larger project that requires communication with the TweetyPie service. 

The module uses the ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule and MtlsClient classes to create a client for the TweetService. The providesTweetypieStitchClient method creates a new instance of the TweetyPie class using the TweetService.MethodPerEndpoint object. This client can then be used to make requests to the TweetyPie service.

The clientId method is used to set the client ID for the TweetyPie client. It uses the ServiceIdentifier instance to get the service and environment names and combines them to create a unique client ID.

The configureMethodBuilder method is used to configure the MethodBuilder object used by the client. It sets the timeout per request to 200 milliseconds, the total timeout to 400 milliseconds, and the idempotent percentage to 1 percent. These values are meant to be reasonable defaults and can be adjusted for specific use cases.

The sessionAcquisitionTimeout method sets the timeout for acquiring a session to 500 milliseconds.

Overall, the TweetyPieClientModule provides a convenient way to create a client for the TweetyPie service with reasonable default settings. It can be used as a dependency in a larger project that requires communication with the TweetyPie service. 

Example usage:

```scala
val injector = Injector()
val client = injector.instance[TweetyPie]
val response = client.getTweet(1234)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code provides an implementation with reasonable defaults for an idempotent TweetyPie Thrift and Stitch client. It configures the timeouts and client ID for the client.

2. What is the significance of the MtlsClient trait being extended in this code?
- The MtlsClient trait being extended in this code indicates that this client module is intended to be used with mutual TLS authentication.

3. Can the timeouts and settings in this module be further tuned for specific use cases?
- Yes, the timeouts and settings in this module can be further tuned for specific use cases. The code notes that the timeouts are meant to represent a reasonable starting point only and recommends creating a local copy for further tuning.
