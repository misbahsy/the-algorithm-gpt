The `FinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxyModule` is a module that provides a Finagle HTTP client with egress proxy support using credentials. This module is used in the larger project to enable communication between services through a proxy server. 

The module is implemented as a Scala object and uses the TwitterModule trait from the Twitter Inject library. It imports several classes and modules from the Finagle and Twitter libraries, including Http, ProxyCredentials, StatsReceiver, and Duration. 

The module provides a single method, `providesFinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy`, which is annotated with `@Provides`, `@Singleton`, and `@Named(FinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy)`. This method takes several parameters, including flags for the Twitter egress proxy host and port, the remote proxy host and port, and various timeouts. It also takes a `ProxyCredentials` object and a `StatsReceiver`. 

The method constructs an `HttpHostPort` object for the Twitter and remote proxy host and port, respectively. It then calls the `buildFinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy` method from the `FinagleHttpClientWithProxyBuilder` class, passing in the various parameters. This method returns a `Http.Client` object, which is then returned by the `providesFinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy` method. 

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to create a Finagle HTTP client with egress proxy support using credentials. It abstracts away the details of constructing the client and allows developers to easily configure the client with various timeouts and proxy settings. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.finagle.http.Request
import com.twitter.finagle.http.Response
import com.twitter.finagle.http.Status
import com.twitter.finagle.Http
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.module.http.FinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxyModule

val client = FinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxyModule.providesFinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy(
  proxyTwitterHost = "proxy.twitter.com",
  proxyTwitterPort = 8080,
  proxyRemoteHost = "remote.proxy.com",
  proxyRemotePort = 8080,
  requestTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(10),
  connectTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(5),
  acquisitionTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(5),
  isServiceLocal = false,
  proxyCredentials = ProxyCredentials("username", "password"),
  statsReceiver = NullStatsReceiver
)

val request = Request("/example")
val response: Future[Response] = client(request)
response.onSuccess { resp: Response =>
  if (resp.status == Status.Ok) {
    println("Request succeeded!")
  } else {
    println(s"Request failed with status ${resp.status}")
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a Finagle HTTP client with Egress Proxy support using Credentials.

2. What are the configurable parameters for this HTTP client?
- The configurable parameters for this HTTP client include proxyTwitterHost, proxyTwitterPort, proxyRemoteHost, proxyRemotePort, requestTimeout, connectTimeout, acquisitionTimeout, isServiceLocal, proxyCredentials, and statsReceiver.

3. What is the recommended approach for further tuning the settings of this HTTP client?
- The recommended approach for further tuning the settings of this HTTP client is to either override the flags or create a local copy of the module.
