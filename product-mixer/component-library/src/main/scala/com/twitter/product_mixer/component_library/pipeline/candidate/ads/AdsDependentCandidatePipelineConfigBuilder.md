The `AdsDependentCandidatePipelineConfigBuilder` class is responsible for building a configuration object for a candidate pipeline that is dependent on ads. The configuration object is an instance of the `AdsDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class, which is used to create a pipeline that generates candidate items for ads.

The `build` method takes in several parameters, including a `CandidateSource` object that provides candidate items for the pipeline, an `AdsDisplayLocationBuilder` object that determines where the ads will be displayed, and various other optional parameters such as gates, filters, and alerts.

The method then creates an instance of the `AdsDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class using the provided parameters and returns it. This configuration object can then be used to create a pipeline that generates candidate items for ads.

For example, the following code creates a `CandidateSource` object and an `AdsDisplayLocationBuilder` object, and then uses them to build a configuration object for an ads-dependent candidate pipeline:

```
val adsCandidateSource = new CandidateSource[AdRequestParams, AdImpression]()
val adsDisplayLocationBuilder = new AdsDisplayLocationBuilder[AdsQuery]()
val config = new AdsDependentCandidatePipelineConfigBuilder().build(
  adsCandidateSource = adsCandidateSource,
  adsDisplayLocationBuilder = adsDisplayLocationBuilder
)
```

This configuration object can then be used to create a pipeline that generates candidate items for ads.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a builder class for creating a pipeline configuration for generating ads candidates based on a given query. It solves the problem of generating relevant ads candidates for a given query.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including AdImpression and AdRequestParams from the com.twitter.adserver.thriftscala package, as well as various classes from the com.twitter.product_mixer package. These dependencies are used to define the inputs and outputs of the pipeline, as well as to provide functionality for filtering, hydrating, and decorating the ads candidates.

3. What customization options are available when using this code?
- This code provides several customization options when building a pipeline configuration, including the ability to specify the candidate source, identifier, display location builder, gate, filter, feature hydrator, decorator, alert, and more. These options allow developers to tailor the pipeline to their specific needs and requirements.
