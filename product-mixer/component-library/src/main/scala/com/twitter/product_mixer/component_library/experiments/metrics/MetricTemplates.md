The `MetricTemplates` object provides functionality for interpolating templates with placeholders. The purpose of this code is to allow for the creation of dynamic metrics with values that are not known until runtime. The `interpolate` method takes an input template string and a map of placeholder values and returns a sequence of strings with the placeholders replaced by their corresponding values. 

The placeholders in the input template string are denoted by `${placeholder}` or `${placeholder[index]}` where `placeholder` is the name of the placeholder and `index` is an optional index for the placeholder value. The `getMatchedPlaceholders` method extracts the matched placeholders from the input template string and returns a sequence of `MatchedPlaceholder` objects that contain the outer key (i.e., the placeholder name) and the inner key (i.e., the index, if present). 

The `interpolate` method then groups the matched placeholders by their outer key and retrieves the corresponding placeholder values from the input map. It then generates all possible combinations of placeholder values using the `crossProduct` method and replaces the placeholders in the input template string with their corresponding values. The resulting sequence of strings is returned as the output of the `interpolate` method.

The `getFieldValue` and `caseAccessors` methods use reflection to get the value of a field in an object and to get a mapping of field names to symbols, respectively. These methods are used internally by the `interpolate` method to retrieve the values of the placeholders from the input map.

Overall, this code provides a useful utility for creating dynamic metrics with values that are not known until runtime. An example usage of this code might be to create a metric that tracks the number of times a particular event occurs, where the event name is a placeholder in the metric template and the event count is the corresponding placeholder value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MetricTemplates` object?
- The `MetricTemplates` object contains methods for interpolating input templates with placeholders and generating template keys for matched placeholders.

2. What is the difference between `PlaceholderPattern` and `IndexedPlaceholderPattern`?
- `PlaceholderPattern` matches placeholders of the form `${placeholder}`, while `IndexedPlaceholderPattern` matches placeholders of the form `${placeholder[index]}` where `index` is a numeric value.

3. What is the purpose of the `caseAccessors` method?
- The `caseAccessors` method uses reflection to get a mapping of field names to symbols for a given case class instance.
