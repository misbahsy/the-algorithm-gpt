This code defines a class called `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydrator` that implements the `QueryFeatureHydrator` interface. The purpose of this class is to hydrate a `PipelineQuery` object with features required for the `CrMLRanker` algorithm. 

The `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydrator` class takes in two parameters: a `CrMLRanker.MethodPerEndpoint` object and a `RankingConfigBuilder` object. The former is used to call the `getCommonFeatures` method of the `CrMLRanker` service, while the latter is used to select the appropriate ranking configuration for the given query. 

The `hydrate` method of the `CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydrator` class takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object. It first uses the `RankingConfigBuilder` to select the appropriate ranking configuration for the given query. It then calls the `getCommonFeatures` method of the `CrMLRanker` service to retrieve the common features required for the algorithm. Finally, it builds a `FeatureMap` object that maps the `CrMlRankerCommonFeatures` and `CrMlRankerRankingConfig` features to their respective values and returns it as a `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object.

This class is likely used as part of a larger system that implements the `CrMLRanker` algorithm. It is responsible for hydrating a `PipelineQuery` object with the features required for the algorithm to function properly. The `CrMlRankerCommonFeatures` and `CrMlRankerRankingConfig` features are likely used by other components of the system to perform the actual ranking of items. 

Example usage:

```
val crMlRanker: t.CrMLRanker.MethodPerEndpoint = // initialize CrMLRanker service
val rankingConfigSelector: RankingConfigBuilder = // initialize RankingConfigBuilder

val hydrator = new CrMlRankerCommonQueryFeatureHydrator(crMlRanker, rankingConfigSelector)

val query: PipelineQuery = // initialize PipelineQuery object

val featureMap: FeatureMap = hydrator.hydrate(query).get // get the FeatureMap object

val commonFeatures: t.CommonFeatures = featureMap.get(CrMlRankerCommonFeatures).asInstanceOf[t.CommonFeatures]
val rankingConfig: t.RankingConfig = featureMap.get(CrMlRankerRankingConfig).asInstanceOf[t.RankingConfig]

// use commonFeatures and rankingConfig to perform ranking of items
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a feature hydrator for a machine learning ranking algorithm called CrMLRanker from Twitter. It defines two features and a class that hydrates these features for a given query using a ranking configuration.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several Twitter libraries, including `com.twitter.cr_ml_ranker`, `com.twitter.product_mixer`, `com.twitter.stitch`, and `thriftscala`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `hydrate` method?
- The `hydrate` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object as input and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object as output. The `FeatureMap` contains the two features defined in the `features` set, `CrMlRankerCommonFeatures` and `CrMlRankerRankingConfig`, which are populated with data from the `crMlRanker` and `rankingConfigSelector` objects.
