This code defines a model for an ArticleCandidate, which is a type of UniversalNoun with an integer ID. The ArticleCandidate is a final class that extends the BaseArticleCandidate trait. The purpose of this class is to provide a high-performance implementation of the equals and hashCode methods, which are used for object comparison and hashing. 

The equals method is implemented to check for referential equality first, followed by a check for equal hashCodes and equal ID values. The hashCode method is implemented as a cached val, which is instantiated once on object construction and prevents the need to recompute the hashCode on each hashCode() invocation. 

The ArticleCandidate model is designed to be used in the larger project as a canonical model for article candidates. Any additional fields should be added as a Feature on the candidate's FeatureMap. If the features come from the candidate source itself, then CandidatePipelineConfig.featuresFromCandidateSourceTransformers can be used to extract features from the candidate source response. 

The ArticleCandidate model is created using the apply method of the companion object, which takes an integer ID as a parameter and returns a new instance of the ArticleCandidate class. 

Overall, this code provides a high-performance implementation of the equals and hashCode methods for the ArticleCandidate model, which is used as a canonical model for article candidates in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseArticleCandidate` trait?
- The `BaseArticleCandidate` trait extends `UniversalNoun[Int]` and likely defines common functionality or properties that are shared by all article candidates.

2. What is the significance of the `final` modifier on the `ArticleCandidate` class?
- The `final` modifier on the `ArticleCandidate` class ensures that it cannot be subclassed. This is important because the `equals()` method implementation relies on referential equality and cached hashcode equality short circuits, which would not work correctly if there were subclasses with different fields.

3. What is the purpose of caching the `hashCode` value as a `val` in the `ArticleCandidate` class?
- Caching the `hashCode` value as a `val` in the `ArticleCandidate` class prevents the need to recompute the `hashCode` on each `hashCode()` invocation, which can improve performance. However, this is only safe if all of the fields used to construct the `hashCode` are immutable and have stable `hashCode` implementations.
