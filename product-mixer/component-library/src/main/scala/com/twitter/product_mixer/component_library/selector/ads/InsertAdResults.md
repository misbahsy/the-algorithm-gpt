The `InsertAdResults` class is responsible for injecting a sequence of AdCandidates into a sequence of non-ad candidates. This is achieved by running a set of adjusters on each SurfaceArea or DisplayLocation, which are set in the pipeline. The adjusters are used to inject ads and reposition them in the sequence of other candidates in the result. The original sequence of non-promoted entries is retained, and the ads are inserted in the sequence using the `goldfinch` library based on the insertion position hydrated in AdsCandidate by Adserver/Admixer.

The `InsertAdResults` class is a Selector that takes a `PipelineQuery with AdsQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the result. It returns a `SelectorResult` object containing the updated remaining candidates and the merged results.

The `InsertAdResults` class uses the `GoldfinchAdsInjector` class to inject ads into the result. The `GoldfinchAdsInjector` class takes a `PipelineQuery with AdsQuery` object, a sequence of non-promoted entries, a sequence of promoted entries, and an `AdsInjectorAdditionalRequestParams` object. It returns an `AdsInjectorOutput` object containing the merged entries and the unused entries.

The `InsertAdResults` class also defines a `GoldfinchResults` case class that is used to flatten the `AdsInjectorOutput` object back into a single sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects.

To use the `InsertAdResults` class, a surface area like `search_tweets(surface_area)` can call `InsertAdResults(surfaceArea = "TweetSearch", candidatePipeline = adsCandidatePipeline.identifier, ProductMixerAdsInjector = productMixerAdsInjector)`, where the pipeline config can call `productMixerAdsInjector.forSurfaceArea("TweetSearch")` to get an `AdsInjector` object.

In summary, the `InsertAdResults` class is a Selector that injects a sequence of AdCandidates into a sequence of non-ad candidates using the `GoldfinchAdsInjector` class. It is used to adjust the sequence of entries in a timeline to include ads and reposition them based on their insertion position.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a selector component for injecting ads into a sequence of non-ad candidates. It is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves serving ads on Twitter's platform.

2. What is the role of the Goldfinch library in this code?
- The Goldfinch library is used to insert ads into the sequence of non-ad candidates based on the insertion position of the ads, which is hydrated in AdsCandidate by Adserver/Admixer.

3. How can this selector be called and what parameters does it require?
- This selector can be called by any surface area like `search_tweets(surface_area)` using `InsertAdResults(surfaceArea = "TweetSearch", candidatePipeline = adsCandidatePipeline.identifier, ProductMixerAdsInjector = productMixerAdsInjector)`. It requires a surface area name, a GoldfinchAdsInjector object, and a candidate pipeline identifier as parameters.
