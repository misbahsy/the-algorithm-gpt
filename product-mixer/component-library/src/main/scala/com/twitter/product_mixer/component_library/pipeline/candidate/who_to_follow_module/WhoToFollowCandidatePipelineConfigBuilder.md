The code defines a class called `WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineConfigBuilder` that builds a configuration for a candidate pipeline used in the Twitter product mixer. The configuration is used to generate a list of user candidates for the "Who to Follow" module. 

The class takes in a `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` object as a parameter, which is used to retrieve user candidates. The `build` method of the class takes in various parameters such as `moduleDisplayTypeBuilder`, `identifier`, `enabledDeciderParam`, `supportedClientParam`, `alerts`, `gates`, `filters`, `feedbackActionInfoBuilder`, `displayLocationParam`, `supportedLayoutsParam`, `layoutVersionParam`, and `excludedUserIdsFeature`. These parameters are used to configure the pipeline and generate the list of user candidates.

The `WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineConfig` object generated by the `build` method contains information such as the pipeline identifier, the display location of the module, the supported layouts, and the excluded user IDs. The `moduleDisplayTypeBuilder` parameter is used to specify the display type of the module, and the `whoToFollowCandidateSource` parameter is used to retrieve user candidates from the `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` object.

Overall, this code is an important part of the "Who to Follow" module in the Twitter product mixer. It generates a configuration for a candidate pipeline that retrieves user candidates from a `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` object and uses various parameters to configure the pipeline and generate the list of user candidates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that builds a configuration for a candidate pipeline called WhoToFollow. It takes in various parameters such as a module display type builder, an identifier, and a candidate source, and returns a WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineConfig object.

2. What other classes or components does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and components from the com.twitter.product_mixer and com.twitter.timelines packages, such as PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource, Feature, Alert, Gate, Filter, and Param.

3. Are there any optional parameters that can be passed into the build method, and what are their default values?
- Yes, there are several optional parameters that can be passed into the build method, such as enabledDeciderParam, supportedClientParam, alerts, gates, filters, feedbackActionInfoBuilder, displayLocationParam, supportedLayoutsParam, layoutVersionParam, and excludedUserIdsFeature. Their default values are None, None, an empty sequence, an empty sequence, an empty sequence, None, a StaticParam with a specific value, a StaticParam with a specific sequence of values, a StaticParam with a specific integer value, and None, respectively.
