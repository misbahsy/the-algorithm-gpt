The `ParamGatedScorer` class is a scorer component that can be turned on and off based on a boolean parameter. It takes in two type parameters, `Query` and `Result`, which represent the domain model for the query or request and the type of the candidates, respectively. 

The class has two properties: `enabledParam` and `scorer`. `enabledParam` is the boolean parameter that determines whether the scorer is enabled or not. `scorer` is the underlying scorer that is run when `enabledParam` is true. 

The class implements the `Scorer` trait and the `Conditionally` trait. The `Scorer` trait defines a method `apply` that takes in a query and a sequence of candidates and returns a `Stitch` of feature maps. The `Conditionally` trait defines a method `onlyIf` that takes in a query and returns a boolean indicating whether the scorer should be applied to the query. 

The `ParamGatedScorer` class overrides the `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, and `onlyIf` methods of the `Scorer` trait. The `identifier` method returns a `ScorerIdentifier` that is the concatenation of the `IdentifierPrefix` and the name of the underlying scorer's identifier. The `alerts` and `features` methods return the alerts and features of the underlying scorer. The `onlyIf` method returns a boolean indicating whether the scorer should be applied to the query based on the `enabledParam` parameter. 

The `ParamGatedScorer` object defines a constant `IdentifierPrefix` that is used to construct the identifier of the `ParamGatedScorer`. 

This component can be used in a larger project to selectively apply a scorer based on a boolean parameter. For example, if there are two scorers that can be applied to a query, but one is more expensive than the other, the `ParamGatedScorer` can be used to only apply the expensive scorer when a certain parameter is true. 

Example usage:

```
val expensiveScorer: Scorer[Query, Result] = ???
val cheapScorer: Scorer[Query, Result] = ???
val enableExpensiveScorer: Param[Boolean] = ???

val gatedScorer = ParamGatedScorer(enableExpensiveScorer, expensiveScorer)
val pipeline = Pipeline(Seq(gatedScorer, cheapScorer))

val query: Query = ???
val candidates: Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[Result]] = ???
val featureMaps: Seq[FeatureMap] = pipeline(query, candidates).get
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a `ParamGatedScorer` class that is a type of `Scorer` used in a pipeline for a query or request. It is used to conditionally run an underlying scorer based on a boolean parameter. It is part of the `component_library` package in the larger `product_mixer` project for Twitter.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on? 
- This code depends on several other classes and packages including `Feature`, `FeatureMap`, `Alert`, `Scorer`, `CandidateWithFeatures`, `Conditionally`, `UniversalNoun`, `ScorerIdentifier`, `PipelineQuery`, `Stitch`, and `Param`. These are all imported at the beginning of the file.

3. How is the `ParamGatedScorer` class implemented and what methods does it override? 
- The `ParamGatedScorer` class is implemented as a case class that takes in a boolean parameter and an underlying scorer. It overrides several methods from the `Scorer` and `Conditionally` traits including `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, `onlyIf`, and `apply`. These methods are used to set the identifier prefix, alerts, features, and conditional logic for the scorer.
