This code defines several classes and traits related to query suggestions in typeahead. The `BaseQuerySuggestionCandidate` trait is a sealed trait that represents a query suggestion in typeahead. It extends the `UniversalNoun` trait, which is a trait that represents a universal noun in the product mixer component library. The `QuerySuggestionCandidate`, `TypeaheadQueryCandidate`, `TypeaheadEventCandidate`, and `TweetAnnotationQueryCandidate` classes are all implementations of the `BaseQuerySuggestionCandidate` trait. 

The `QuerySuggestionCandidate` class represents a canonical query suggestion candidate model. It has an `id` field of type `String` and a `metadata` field of type `Option[TypeaheadMetadata]`. The `TypeaheadQueryCandidate` class represents a canonical typeahead query candidate model. It has an `id` field of type `String` and a `score` field of type `Option[Double]`. The `TypeaheadEventCandidate` class represents a typeahead event candidate model. It has an `id` field of type `Long` and a `metadata` field of type `Option[TypeaheadMetadata]`. The `TweetAnnotationQueryCandidate` class represents a canonical tweet annotation query candidate model. It has an `id` field of type `String` and a `score` field of type `Option[Double]`.

All of these classes have an `equals` method that provides a high performance implementation of the equals method. They also have a `hashCode` method that leverages domain-specific constraints to safely construct and cache the hashCode as a val. 

Overall, this code provides a set of classes and traits that can be used to represent different types of query suggestion candidates in typeahead. These classes and traits can be used in the larger project to represent and manipulate query suggestion candidates. For example, they could be used in a typeahead service to generate and return query suggestions to users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseQuerySuggestionCandidate` trait and how is it used?
- The `BaseQuerySuggestionCandidate` trait represents a query suggestion in typeahead and is used as a base trait for other candidate models such as `QuerySuggestionCandidate`, `TypeaheadQueryCandidate`, `TypeaheadEventCandidate`, and `TweetAnnotationQueryCandidate`.

2. What is the significance of the `final` modifier on the `QuerySuggestionCandidate`, `TypeaheadQueryCandidate`, `TypeaheadEventCandidate`, and `TweetAnnotationQueryCandidate` classes?
- The `final` modifier ensures that these classes cannot be extended or subclassed. If the `final` modifier is removed, the `equals()` implementation must be updated to handle class inheritor equality.

3. What is the purpose of the `metadata` field in the `QuerySuggestionCandidate`, `TypeaheadEventCandidate`, and `TypeaheadQueryCandidate` classes?
- The `metadata` field is an optional field that contains additional metadata about the candidate. It is used to store information such as the type of suggestion or the source of the suggestion.
