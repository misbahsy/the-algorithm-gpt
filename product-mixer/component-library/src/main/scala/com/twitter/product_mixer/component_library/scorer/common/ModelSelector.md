This code defines a trait and two classes that are used for selecting which ML model to use in a pipeline query. The trait, called `ModelSelector`, takes a generic type parameter `Query` that must extend `PipelineQuery`. It defines a single abstract method `apply` that takes a `Query` object and returns an optional `String` representing the chosen model ID or name.

The first class, `ParamModelSelector`, is a concrete implementation of `ModelSelector` that selects a model based on a `Param` object. The `Param` object is a configuration parameter that is passed in as a constructor argument. The `apply` method of this class returns the value of the `Param` object from the `Query` object's `params` map.

The second class, `StaticModelSelector`, is another concrete implementation of `ModelSelector` that always selects the same model name. This class takes a `String` representing the model name as a constructor argument. The `apply` method of this class always returns the same model name.

These classes are likely used in a larger project that involves running ML models on pipeline queries. The `ModelSelector` trait allows for different strategies for selecting which model to use, depending on the needs of the pipeline. The `ParamModelSelector` class allows for dynamic selection of a model based on a configuration parameter, while the `StaticModelSelector` class allows for a fixed model to be used. 

Here is an example of how these classes might be used in a pipeline query:

```
val query = PipelineQuery(params = Map("model" -> "my_model"))
val modelSelector = ParamModelSelector(Param[String]("model"))
val modelName = modelSelector(query).getOrElse("default_model")
// use the selected model name to run the ML model on the query
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines traits and classes for selecting which ML model to use when calling an underlying ML Model Service.

2. What is the difference between ModelSelector and ParamModelSelector?
   - ModelSelector is a trait that defines a method for selecting a model ID/name, while ParamModelSelector is a class that implements ModelSelector and selects a model based on a ConfigAPI Param object.

3. Can StaticModelSelector be used with any type of PipelineQuery?
   - No, StaticModelSelector can only be used with PipelineQuery and not any subtype of it, as it explicitly extends ModelSelector[PipelineQuery].
