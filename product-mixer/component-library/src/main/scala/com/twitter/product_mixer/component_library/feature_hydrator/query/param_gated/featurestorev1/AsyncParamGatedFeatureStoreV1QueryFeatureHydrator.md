The `AsyncParamGatedFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` class is a query feature hydrator that hydrates asynchronously for features to be used before a specified pipeline step. It is conditionally based on a `Param` that can turn the hydrator on and off. 

This class extends the `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` class, which is responsible for hydrating features for a given query. It also implements the `Conditionally` and `AsyncHydrator` traits. The `Conditionally` trait provides a method to check if the hydrator should be applied to a given query, while the `AsyncHydrator` trait allows for asynchronous feature hydration.

The `AsyncParamGatedFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` class takes three parameters: `enabledParam`, `hydrateBefore`, and `queryFeatureHydrator`. The `enabledParam` parameter is a `Param` that determines whether the hydrator should be applied to a given query. The `hydrateBefore` parameter is a `PipelineStepIdentifier` that specifies the pipeline step before which the features should be hydrated. The `queryFeatureHydrator` parameter is the underlying `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` to run when `enabledParam` is true.

The class overrides several methods from the `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` class, including `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, and `clientBuilder`. It also overrides the `onlyIf` method from the `Conditionally` trait to check if the hydrator should be applied to a given query. Finally, it overrides the `hydrate` method from the `AsyncHydrator` trait to hydrate the features asynchronously.

Overall, this class provides a way to conditionally hydrate features asynchronously for a given query, based on a specified pipeline step and a `Param` that can turn the hydrator on and off. It can be used as part of a larger project to provide feature hydration for machine learning models or other data processing tasks. 

Example usage:

```
val hydrator = AsyncParamGatedFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator(
  enabledParam = Param("enabled", true),
  hydrateBefore = PipelineStepIdentifier("myStep"),
  queryFeatureHydrator = myFeatureHydrator
)

val query = MyPipelineQuery(...)
val featureMap: Future[FeatureMap] = hydrator.hydrate(query).runAsync
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a Scala class that represents an asynchronous feature hydrator for a specific type of query. It is part of the feature hydrator component library for the larger project.

2. What other classes or components does this code interact with? 
- This code interacts with several other classes and components, including EntityId, FeatureMap, Alert, AsyncHydrator, FeatureStoreV1DynamicClientBuilder, and FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator.

3. What is the significance of the "enabledParam" parameter and how does it affect the behavior of this class? 
- The "enabledParam" parameter is used to turn the feature hydrator on and off based on a boolean value. When it is true, the underlying FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator is run, and when it is false, no features are hydrated.
