This code defines two classes, `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator`, which are used to hydrate features asynchronously for a given query or request. Both classes take in a `PipelineStepIdentifier` parameter to ensure that the features are hydrated before a certain step in the pipeline. 

`AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` extends `QueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncHydrator`, and takes in a `QueryFeatureHydrator` parameter. It overrides the `hydrate` method to hydrate the features asynchronously using the `Stitch` library. It also overrides the `identifier`, `alerts`, and `features` properties to add the "Async" prefix to the identifier and to inherit the alerts and features from the underlying `QueryFeatureHydrator`.

`AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` extends `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncHydrator`, and takes in a `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` parameter. It overrides the `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, and `clientBuilder` properties to add the "Async" prefix to the identifier and to inherit the alerts, features, and client builder from the underlying `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator`.

The `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` classes are used to hydrate features asynchronously in a larger project. They can be instantiated using the `apply` method, which takes in a `PipelineStepIdentifier` and a `QueryFeatureHydrator` or `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` parameter. 

For example, to create an `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` for a given `PipelineStepIdentifier` and `QueryFeatureHydrator`, we can call the `apply` method as follows:

```
val hydrator = AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator(
  PipelineStepIdentifier("some_step"),
  queryFeatureHydrator
)
```

Similarly, to create an `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator`, we can call the `apply` method as follows:

```
val hydrator = AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator(
  PipelineStepIdentifier("some_step"),
  featureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator
)
```

Overall, these classes provide a way to hydrate features asynchronously in a larger pipeline, which can improve performance and reduce latency.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AsyncHydrator` trait and how is it used in this code?
   - The `AsyncHydrator` trait is used to indicate that a feature hydrator can hydrate features asynchronously. It is mixed in with the `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` classes to enable asynchronous feature hydration.
2. What is the difference between `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator`?
   - `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` is a class that asynchronously hydrates features using a `QueryFeatureHydrator`, while `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator` is a class that asynchronously hydrates features using a `FeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator`. The latter is specifically designed for feature store hydrators and is exempt from validations at runtime.
3. What is the purpose of the `hydrateBefore` parameter in both `AsyncQueryFeatureHydrator` and `AsyncFeatureStoreV1QueryFeatureHydrator`?
   - The `hydrateBefore` parameter is used to specify the pipeline step before which the features should be hydrated. This ensures that the features are available for use in subsequent pipeline steps.
