The code defines a module for building a Finatra HTTP client with egress proxy support and credentials for a host. The module provides a method that returns an instance of the Finatra HTTP client. The client is built using the `buildFinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy` and `buildFinagleHttpServiceWithProxy` methods from the `FinagleHttpClientWithProxyBuilder` class. The `buildFinagleHttpClientWithCredentialProxy` method builds a Finagle HTTP client with egress proxy support and credentials for a host. The `buildFinagleHttpServiceWithProxy` method builds a Finagle HTTP service with proxy support for a host. The `HttpClient` class is used to create an instance of the Finatra HTTP client. The `HttpClient` class takes the hostname of the Twitter egress proxy, the Finagle HTTP service with proxy support, and an object mapper used by the built-in JSON response parsing as parameters. 

The purpose of this module is to provide a convenient way to build a Finatra HTTP client with egress proxy support and credentials for a host. The client can be used to make HTTP requests to a remote server through a proxy server. The module provides default values for the timeouts and other settings, but these can be overridden by passing in different values for the flags. The module can be used in the larger project to make HTTP requests to remote servers through a proxy server with credentials. 

Example usage:

```scala
class MyService extends HttpServer {

  override def configureHttp(router: HttpRouter): Unit = {
    val httpClient = injector.instance[HttpClient](names.named(FinatraHttpClientWithCredentialProxyModule.FinatraHttpClientWithCredentialProxy))
    router.add(new MyController(httpClient))
  }
  
  ...
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a module for building a Finatra HTTP client with Egress Proxy support with Credentials for a host.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several libraries such as com.twitter.finagle.http.ProxyCredentials, com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.finatra.httpclient.HttpClient, and com.twitter.util.jackson.ScalaObjectMapper.

3. How can the timeouts be further tuned?
- The timeouts configured in this module are meant to be a reasonable starting point only. To further tuning the settings, either override the flags or create a local copy of the module.
