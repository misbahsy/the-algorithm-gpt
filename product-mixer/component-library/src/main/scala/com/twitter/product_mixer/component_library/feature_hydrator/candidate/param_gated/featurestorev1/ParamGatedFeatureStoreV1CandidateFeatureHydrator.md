The `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` is a class that extends the `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` and adds a conditional gating mechanism based on a `Param`. The purpose of this class is to enable or disable the underlying `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` based on the value of the `enabledParam`. 

The `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Candidate`. `Query` is the domain model for the query or request, and `Candidate` is the type of the candidates. The `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` has two constructor parameters: `enabledParam` and `candidateFeatureHydrator`. `enabledParam` is the `Param` that controls whether the `candidateFeatureHydrator` is enabled or disabled. `candidateFeatureHydrator` is the underlying `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` that is run when `enabledParam` is true.

The `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` overrides several methods from the `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` class. The `identifier` method returns a new `FeatureHydratorIdentifier` with the prefix "ParamGated" added to the name of the underlying `candidateFeatureHydrator`. The `alerts` method returns the alerts from the underlying `candidateFeatureHydrator`. The `features` method returns the features from the underlying `candidateFeatureHydrator`. The `clientBuilder` method returns the client builder from the underlying `candidateFeatureHydrator`.

The `onlyIf` method is the gating mechanism that determines whether the underlying `candidateFeatureHydrator` should be run. It takes a `Query` parameter and returns a boolean. The boolean value is determined by calling the `and` method of the `Conditionally` trait with the `query`, `candidateFeatureHydrator`, and `query.params(enabledParam)` as parameters. The `and` method returns true if the `candidateFeatureHydrator` is enabled and the `query` satisfies the gating condition.

The `apply` method takes a `Query` parameter and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects. It returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of `FeatureMap` objects. The `apply` method calls the `apply` method of the underlying `candidateFeatureHydrator` with the `query` and `candidates` parameters.

The `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` object contains a constant `IdentifierPrefix` that is used to create the `identifier` for the `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator`. 

Overall, the `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` provides a way to conditionally enable or disable a `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` based on a `Param`. This can be useful in situations where certain features should only be enabled under certain conditions. For example, a feature that is computationally expensive may only be enabled when the system has enough resources to handle the computation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a case class `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` that extends `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` and adds a condition based on a `Param` to turn it on and off. It is part of the `feature_hydrator` component library for the larger project.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `query` of type `Query` and a sequence of `candidates` of type `Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]]`. It returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `FeatureMap`.

3. What is the purpose of the `IdentifierPrefix` object?
- The `IdentifierPrefix` object is a string that is used to prefix the name of the `identifier` of the `ParamGatedFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator`. It is set to "ParamGated".
