The code defines a filter component for a pipeline that processes ads candidates. Specifically, it filters out non-promoted tweets from a list of ads candidates. The filter takes in a query and a sequence of candidates with features, and applies an underlying filter to a subset of the candidates that are AdsTweetCandidates. The resulting filter output is then used to remove non-promoted tweets from the original list of candidates.

The PromotedTweetsOnlyFilter class is defined as a case class that takes in an underlying filter of type Filter[Query, AdsTweetCandidate]. It extends the Filter[Query, AdsCandidate] trait, which means it can be used as a filter component in a pipeline that processes AdsCandidates.

The apply method of the PromotedTweetsOnlyFilter takes in a query and a sequence of candidates with features. It first filters out the AdsTweetCandidates from the sequence of candidates with features, and applies the underlying filter to this subset of candidates. The resulting filter output is then used to remove non-promoted tweets from the original list of candidates. The removed and kept candidates are returned as a FilterResult[AdsCandidate].

This filter component can be used in a larger pipeline that processes ads candidates to ensure that only promoted tweets are included in the final output. For example, the pipeline may include components that extract features from the ads candidates, rank the candidates based on their relevance to the query, and select the top candidates for display. The PromotedTweetsOnlyFilter can be used as a pre-processing step to ensure that only promoted tweets are considered for ranking and selection.

Example usage:

```
val pipeline = Pipeline[Query, AdsCandidate](
  PromotedTweetsOnlyFilter(underlyingFilter),
  FeatureExtractor(),
  Ranker(),
  Selector()
)

val query = Query(...)
val candidates = Seq(...)
val result = pipeline.run(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a filter component for a pipeline in the candidate ads section of the product mixer component library. It takes in a query and a sequence of candidate ads with features, filters out non-promoted tweet candidates, and returns a filter result of kept and removed ads.

2. What is the underlyingFilter parameter and how is it used in the apply method? 
- The underlyingFilter parameter is a Filter object that takes in a PipelineQuery and a sequence of AdsTweetCandidate objects. It is used in the apply method to filter out non-promoted tweet candidates from the sequence of candidate ads with features.

3. What is the purpose of the Stitch library in this code? 
- The Stitch library is used to handle asynchronous operations in the apply method. It takes in a FilterResult object and returns a Stitch object that can be used to handle the result of the filter operation asynchronously.
