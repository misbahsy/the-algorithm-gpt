The `QualityFactorGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` is a Scala object that contains a case class with a constructor that creates a new instance of a `CandidateFeatureHydrator`. This class is used to hydrate features for a given query or request. The `QualityFactorGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` is designed to work with a `PipelineQuery` that has a `HasQualityFactorStatus` trait. 

The `QualityFactorGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` takes in three parameters: `pipelineIdentifier`, `qualityFactorInclusiveThreshold`, and `candidateFeatureHydrator`. The `pipelineIdentifier` is the identifier of the pipeline that is associated with the observed quality factor. The `qualityFactorInclusiveThreshold` is the inclusive threshold of the quality factor that results in the underlying hydrator being turned off if the value is below it. The `candidateFeatureHydrator` is the underlying `CandidateFeatureHydrator` to run when the quality factor value is above the given inclusive threshold.

The `QualityFactorGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` is a subclass of `CandidateFeatureHydrator` and `Conditionally`. It overrides the `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, `onlyIf`, and `apply` methods. The `identifier` method returns a new `FeatureHydratorIdentifier` with the name of the underlying hydrator appended with the prefix "QfGated". The `alerts` method returns the alerts of the underlying hydrator. The `features` method returns the features of the underlying hydrator. 

The `onlyIf` method is used to determine whether the underlying hydrator should be run based on the quality factor value. It takes in a `Query` and returns a boolean. The `onlyIf` method uses the `Conditionally.and` method to check if the quality factor value is greater than or equal to the `qualityFactorInclusiveThreshold`. If it is, then the underlying hydrator is run. If it is not, then the underlying hydrator is not run.

The `apply` method is used to apply the underlying hydrator to the query, candidate, and existing features. It takes in a `Query`, `Result`, and `FeatureMap` and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]`. The `apply` method calls the `apply` method of the underlying hydrator and passes in the query, candidate, and existing features.

Overall, the `QualityFactorGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` is a useful tool for controlling when a `CandidateFeatureHydrator` should be run based on the quality factor value. It allows for more efficient use of resources by only running the hydrator when it is needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a candidate feature hydrator that is conditionally based on a quality factor threshold. It is part of the component library for feature hydrators in the larger project.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a query, a candidate, and an existing feature map, and returns a `Stitch` of the updated feature map.

3. How is the `onlyIf` method used to determine whether the underlying hydrator should be turned off?
- The `onlyIf` method checks if the quality factor value for the given pipeline identifier is greater than or equal to the inclusive threshold. If it is, then the underlying hydrator is turned on, otherwise it is turned off.
