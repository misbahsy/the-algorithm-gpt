The `AdsInjector` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for injecting ads into different surface areas of the application. It is a singleton class that takes in a `StatsReceiver`, a `localConfigRepoPath` and a `isServiceLocal` flag as constructor arguments. 

The `AdsInjector` class has a method called `forSurfaceArea` that takes in a `SurfaceAreaName` and returns a `GoldfinchAdsInjector`. The `GoldfinchAdsInjector` is responsible for injecting ads into the specified surface area. The `forSurfaceArea` method creates a new `scopedStatsReceiver` by scoping the `statsReceiver` with the surface area name. It then creates a `nonAdsAdaptor` and an `adsAdaptor` using the `ProductMixerNonPromotedEntriesAdaptor` and `ProductMixerPromotedEntriesAdaptor` classes respectively. The `nonAdsAdaptor` is responsible for handling non-promoted entries and the `adsAdaptor` is responsible for handling promoted entries. 

The `AdsInjector` class also creates a `featureSwitchFactory` using either a `LocalDevelopmentFeatureSwitchResultsFactory` or a `DefaultFeatureSwitchResultsFactory` depending on the value of the `isServiceLocal` flag. The `featureSwitchFactory` is responsible for determining which ads to show based on the feature switches. 

Finally, the `AdsInjector` class creates a new `AdsInjectorBuilder` using the `requestAdapter`, `nonPromotedEntriesAdaptor`, `promotedEntriesAdaptor`, `adjusters`, `featureSwitchFactory`, `statsReceiver`, and `logger`. The `AdsInjectorBuilder` is responsible for building the `GoldfinchAdsInjector` that will be returned by the `forSurfaceArea` method.

Example usage:
```scala
val adsInjector = new AdsInjector(statsReceiver, localConfigRepoPath, isServiceLocal)
val surfaceAreaName = SurfaceAreaName("example_surface_area")
val adsInjectorForSurfaceArea = adsInjector.forSurfaceArea(surfaceAreaName)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is an implementation of an AdsInjector class that provides a GoldfinchAdsInjector for a given surface area. It uses various adaptors and converters to build the injector and adjusters to adjust the injection surface area.
   
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on various classes from com.twitter and com.google.inject packages, including StatsReceiver, AdsInjectionRequestContextConverter, PromotedEntriesAdaptor, NonPromotedEntriesAdaptor, and PipelineQuery, among others.

3. What is the role of the @Singleton annotation in this code?
   - The @Singleton annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the AdsInjector class should be created and shared across the application. This is useful for ensuring that the same instance is used consistently and can help with performance and memory usage.
