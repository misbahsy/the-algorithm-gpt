[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/component-library/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/component_library/model/candidate/UserCandidate.scala)

The code defines a model for a user candidate in a product mixer component library. The `UserCandidate` class extends a `BaseUserCandidate` trait which extends a `UniversalNoun` trait. The `UserCandidate` class is marked as `final` and takes a `Long` id as a parameter in its constructor. It overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods for efficient comparison and caching of hash codes. The `UserCandidate` object provides a factory method to create instances of the `UserCandidate` class.

The purpose of this code is to provide a canonical model for a user candidate that can be used in the larger product mixer component library. The `UserCandidate` class can be used to represent a user candidate in various contexts, such as in a recommendation system or in a search engine. The `IsMarkUnreadFeature` object provides a feature to indicate whether a rendered user candidate should be marked unread in URT (User Response Time).

Example usage:

```scala
val userCandidate = UserCandidate(12345)
val isMarkUnread = IsMarkUnreadFeature(userCandidate)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseUserCandidate` trait and why is it annotated with `@JsonTypeName`?
   
   The `BaseUserCandidate` trait is a base model for user candidates and is annotated with `@JsonTypeName` to identify it as a renderable entity to Turntable. 

2. What is the purpose of the `UserCandidate` class and why is it `final`?

   The `UserCandidate` class is a canonical model for user candidates and is `final` to ensure that the `equals()` implementation can handle class inheritor equality.

3. What is the purpose of the `IsMarkUnreadFeature` object and where is it used?

   The `IsMarkUnreadFeature` object is a feature that indicates whether a rendered user candidate should be marked unread in URT. It is used in `UserCandidateUrtItemBuilder` when decorating the candidate.
