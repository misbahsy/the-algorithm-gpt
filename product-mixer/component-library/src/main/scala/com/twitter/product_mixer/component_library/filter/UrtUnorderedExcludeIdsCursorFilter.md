The code defines a filter component for a product mixing system. The purpose of this filter is to exclude certain candidates from the list of products that are being mixed. The filter takes in a query and a list of candidates, and returns a filtered list of candidates. 

The filter is specifically designed to work with a cursor called `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor`, which is used to exclude certain candidates from the list. The cursor is a part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model.cursor` package. 

The filter is implemented as a case class called `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursorFilter`. It extends the `Filter` trait, which is a part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.filter` package. The `Filter` trait defines a common interface for all filters in the product mixing system. 

The `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursorFilter` class has two type parameters: `Candidate` and `Query`. `Candidate` is a type parameter that represents the type of the candidates that are being filtered. `Query` is a type parameter that represents the type of the query that is being filtered. The `Query` type parameter is constrained to be a subtype of `PipelineQuery` and to mix in the `HasPipelineCursor[UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor]` trait. 

The `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursorFilter` class has an `apply` method that takes in a query and a list of candidates, and returns a filtered list of candidates. The method uses the `excludedIds` field of the cursor to exclude certain candidates from the list. The method returns a `Stitch` value that contains the filtered list of candidates. 

Overall, this filter component is an important part of the product mixing system. It allows users to exclude certain candidates from the list of products that are being mixed, which can be useful in a variety of scenarios. For example, a user might want to exclude certain products that are out of stock or that are not relevant to their needs. The filter is easy to use and can be integrated into the larger product mixing system with minimal effort. 

Example usage:

```
val query = new PipelineQuery with HasPipelineCursor[UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor] {
  override val pipelineCursor: Option[UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor] = Some(new UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor {
    override val excludedIds: Seq[Long] = Seq(1, 2, 3)
  })
}

val candidates = Seq(
  CandidateWithFeatures(Candidate(1), Seq.empty),
  CandidateWithFeatures(Candidate(2), Seq.empty),
  CandidateWithFeatures(Candidate(3), Seq.empty),
  CandidateWithFeatures(Candidate(4), Seq.empty),
  CandidateWithFeatures(Candidate(5), Seq.empty)
)

val filter = UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursorFilter[Candidate, PipelineQuery with HasPipelineCursor[UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor]]()

val filteredCandidates = filter.apply(query, candidates).get.kept

// filteredCandidates should be Seq(Candidate(4), Candidate(5))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a filter component for a product mixer system that takes in a query and a sequence of candidates, and returns a filtered result based on excluded IDs in the query.

2. What are the input and output types of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `Query` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]` objects, and returns a `Stitch` object that wraps a `FilterResult[Candidate]` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor` class?
- The `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor` class is a model class that represents a cursor with excluded IDs for a pipeline query. It is used as a type parameter for the `Query` type in the `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursorFilter` class.
