This code defines a configuration class for a dependent candidate pipeline in the "Who to Follow" module of Twitter's product mixer component library. The purpose of this pipeline is to generate a list of recommended users for a given query. 

The class extends the `DependentCandidatePipelineConfig` class and takes in several parameters, including an identifier for the pipeline, a candidate source (`whoToFollowCandidateSource`), filters to apply to the pipeline, and a decorator to modify the output. 

The `candidateSource` parameter is set to the `whoToFollowCandidateSource` passed in, which is an instance of the `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` class. This class is responsible for retrieving candidate users from Twitter's people discovery API. 

The `queryTransformer` parameter is set to an instance of the `WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer` class, which transforms the input query into a `GetModuleRequest` object that can be used to retrieve recommended users from the candidate source. 

The `featuresFromCandidateSourceTransformers` parameter is set to an instance of the `WhoToFollowResponseFeatureTransformer` class, which extracts features from the response returned by the candidate source. 

The `resultTransformer` parameter is set to a function that takes a `RecommendedUser` object (returned by the candidate source) and returns a `UserCandidate` object. 

Finally, the `decorator` parameter is set to an instance of the `WhoToFollowCandidateDecorator` class, which decorates the output of the pipeline with additional information such as display type and feedback action info. 

Overall, this configuration class defines the components and transformations necessary to generate a list of recommended users for a given query in the "Who to Follow" module. It can be used as part of a larger system to provide personalized recommendations to Twitter users. 

Example usage:

```
val pipelineConfig = new WhoToFollowDependentCandidatePipelineConfig(
  identifier = CandidatePipelineIdentifier("who_to_follow"),
  enabledDeciderParam = Some(DeciderParam(true)),
  supportedClientParam = Some(FSParam(true)),
  alerts = Seq.empty,
  gates = Seq.empty,
  whoToFollowCandidateSource = new PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource(),
  filters = Seq.empty,
  moduleDisplayTypeBuilder = new BaseModuleDisplayTypeBuilder(),
  feedbackActionInfoBuilder = None,
  displayLocationParam = Param("sidebar"),
  supportedLayoutsParam = Param(Seq("list", "grid")),
  layoutVersionParam = Param(2),
  excludedUserIdsFeature = None
)

val pipeline = pipelineConfig.build()
val query = PipelineQuery("sports")
val results = pipeline.run(query)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration class for a dependent candidate pipeline in the Who To Follow module of Twitter's product mixer component library. It sets up various components such as candidate source, filters, transformers, and decorators to generate user candidates for the module.
2. What are some of the dependencies used in this code?
   - This code uses dependencies such as com.twitter.peoplediscovery.api, com.twitter.product_mixer.core, com.twitter.timelines.configapi, and com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.candidate_source.people_discovery to implement various components of the pipeline.
3. What is the role of the WhoToFollowCandidateDecorator in this code?
   - The WhoToFollowCandidateDecorator is an optional component that decorates the generated user candidates with additional metadata such as display type and feedback action information. It is used to enhance the user experience of the Who To Follow module.
