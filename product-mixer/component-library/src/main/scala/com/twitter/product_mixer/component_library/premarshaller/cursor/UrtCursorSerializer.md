The `UrtCursorSerializer` object is responsible for serializing and deserializing all supported URT cursors. It provides methods for serializing a cursor object into a string and deserializing a cursor string into a cursor object. The supported cursor types include `UrtOrderedCursor`, `UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor`, `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor`, `UrtPassThroughCursor`, and `UrtPlaceholderCursor`.

The `serializeCursor` method takes a `UrtPipelineCursor` object and returns a string representation of the cursor. It uses pattern matching to determine the type of the cursor and serialize it accordingly. For example, if the cursor is an `UrtOrderedCursor`, it creates a Thrift object of type `ProductMixerRequestCursor.UrtOrderedCursor` and serializes it using `CursorThriftSerializer`. The resulting string is returned.

The `deserialize*Cursor` methods take a cursor string and attempt to deserialize it into the corresponding cursor object. They use pattern matching to determine the type of the cursor and deserialize it accordingly. For example, if the cursor string represents an `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor`, it deserializes the string using `CursorThriftSerializer` and creates an `UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor` object with the deserialized data.

The `deserializeUrtCursor` method is a helper method that takes a cursor string, a partial function that maps a Thrift cursor object to a cursor object, and attempts to deserialize the cursor string into a cursor object using the partial function. If the partial function does not match the Thrift cursor object, it falls back to treating the cursor as an `UrtPlaceholderCursor`.

Overall, the `UrtCursorSerializer` object provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize URT cursors in the larger project. It is used by other components that need to work with URT cursors, such as the `CursorComponent` and the `CursorManager`. For example, the `CursorComponent` uses `UrtCursorSerializer` to serialize and deserialize cursors when communicating with the `CursorManager`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code handles serialization and deserialization for all supported URT cursors.

2. What are the different types of URT cursors supported by this code?
- The different types of URT cursors supported by this code are UrtOrderedCursor, UrtUnorderedExcludeIdsCursor, UrtUnorderedBloomFilterCursor, UrtPassThroughCursor, and UrtPlaceholderCursor.

3. What is the role of the CursorTypeMarshaller in this code?
- The CursorTypeMarshaller is used to convert between the cursor type enum in the Thrift definition and the corresponding Scala case class.
