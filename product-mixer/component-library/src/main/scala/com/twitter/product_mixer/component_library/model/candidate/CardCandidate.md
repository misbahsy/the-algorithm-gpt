This code defines a class called `CardCandidate` that extends the `UniversalNoun` class. The purpose of this class is to represent a candidate for a card in a product mixer. The `CardCandidate` class has a single constructor that takes an `id` parameter and sets it as an instance variable. The `id` parameter is a `String` that uniquely identifies the candidate.

The `CardCandidate` class overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods inherited from the `UniversalNoun` class. The `equals` method is implemented to compare two `CardCandidate` objects based on their `id` values. The `hashCode` method is implemented to compute a hash code for a `CardCandidate` object based on its `id` value. The `hashCode` value is cached as a `val` to improve performance.

The `CardCandidate` class has a companion object that defines a factory method called `apply`. The `apply` method takes an `id` parameter and returns a new `CardCandidate` object with the given `id`.

The code also includes some documentation that provides guidance on how to extend the `CardCandidate` class. It suggests that any additional fields should be added as a `Feature` on the candidate's `FeatureMap`. It also notes that the `CardCandidate` class should always remain `final` and that the `equals` implementation must be updated if the `final` modifier is removed.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient implementation of a candidate for a card in a product mixer. It can be used as a building block for more complex components in the larger project. For example, it could be used as part of a recommendation engine that suggests cards to users based on their preferences and behavior.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the CardCandidate class?
- The CardCandidate class is a model for a candidate and should always be preferred over other variants.

2. What is the purpose of the equals() method in the CardCandidate class?
- The equals() method is a high-performance implementation that checks for referential equality short circuit, cached hashcode equality short circuit, and field values equality.

3. Why is caching the hashCode in the CardCandidate class safe?
- Caching the hashCode is safe because all of the fields used to construct the hashCode are immutable, including the inability to mutate the object reference and the field object instance itself.
