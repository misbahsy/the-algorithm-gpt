The code defines a selector component for a product mixing pipeline. The purpose of this selector is to append all candidates missing a specific feature to the results pool and keep the rest in the remaining candidates. This is useful for backfill scoring candidates without a score from a previous scorer. 

The `InsertAppendWithoutFeatureResults` class takes two parameters: `pipelineScope` and `missingFeature`. `pipelineScope` is the pipeline scope to check, and `missingFeature` is the missing feature to check for. The class extends the `Selector` trait, which defines a method `apply` that takes three parameters: `query`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result`. 

The `apply` method partitions the `remainingCandidates` into two groups: `candidatesWithMissingFeature` and `candidatesWithFeature`. The `candidatesWithMissingFeature` group contains candidates that are missing the `missingFeature` feature, while the `candidatesWithFeature` group contains candidates that have the `missingFeature` feature. The method then appends the `candidatesWithMissingFeature` to the `result` pool and returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result` pools.

This selector can be used in a larger product mixing pipeline to ensure that all candidates are scored, even if they are missing a specific feature. For example, if a previous scorer did not score candidates that are missing a certain feature, this selector can be used to append those candidates to the results pool and ensure that they are scored by a subsequent scorer. 

Here is an example of how this selector can be used in a product mixing pipeline:

```
val pipelineScope = CandidateScope(Seq("feature1", "feature2"))
val missingFeature = Feature[String, String]("feature3")
val selector = InsertAppendWithoutFeatureResults(pipelineScope, missingFeature)

val query = PipelineQuery(Seq("query1", "query2"))
val remainingCandidates = Seq(
  CandidateWithDetails(Seq("feature1", "feature2"), Map("feature3" -> "value1")),
  CandidateWithDetails(Seq("feature1", "feature2"), Map("feature3" -> "value2")),
  CandidateWithDetails(Seq("feature1", "feature2"), Map("feature4" -> "value3"))
)
val result = Seq(
  CandidateWithDetails(Seq("feature1", "feature2"), Map("feature3" -> "value3"))
)

val selectorResult = selector.apply(query, remainingCandidates, result)
```

In this example, the `pipelineScope` contains two features: "feature1" and "feature2". The `missingFeature` is "feature3". The `remainingCandidates` contains three candidates, one of which is missing "feature3". The `result` contains one candidate that already has "feature3". The `selector` is then applied to the `query`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result` to obtain a `selectorResult` that contains the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result` pools.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a selector that appends candidates missing a specific feature to the results pool and keeps the rest in the remaining candidates. It is used in the product mixer component library for backfill scoring candidates without a score from a previous scorer.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing current results. It outputs a `SelectorResult` object containing the updated remaining candidates and results.

3. What is the purpose of the `missingFeature` parameter in the `InsertAppendWithoutFeatureResults` case class?
- The `missingFeature` parameter specifies the feature that is missing from candidates that should be appended to the results pool.
