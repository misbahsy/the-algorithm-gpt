The code defines a Scala object and a case class that are used to select candidates from one or more candidate pipelines and append them to the end of a result. The object is called `InsertAppendResults` and it has two `apply` methods that create instances of the case class. The case class is also called `InsertAppendResults` and it extends a `Selector` trait. The `Selector` trait has an `apply` method that takes a query, a sequence of remaining candidates, and a sequence of results, and returns a `SelectorResult`. 

The `InsertAppendResults` case class takes a type parameter `Query` that must be a subtype of `PipelineQuery`. It also takes a `pipelineScope` parameter of type `CandidateScope`. The `apply` method of the `InsertAppendResults` object creates an instance of the case class by passing a `SpecificPipeline` or a `SpecificPipelines` object that wraps one or more `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s. 

The purpose of the `InsertAppendResults` selector is to select all candidates from one or more candidate pipelines and append them to the end of the result. If multiple candidate pipelines are specified, their candidates will be added to the result in the order in which they appear in the candidate pool. This ordering often reflects the order in which the candidate pipelines were listed in the mixer/recommendations pipeline, unless an `UpdateSortCandidates` selector was run prior to running this selector which could change this ordering. 

If inserting results from multiple candidate pipelines, it is more performant to include all (or a subset) of the candidate pipelines in a single `InsertAppendResults`, as opposed to calling `InsertAppendResults` individually for each candidate pipeline because each selector does an O(n) pass on the candidate pool. 

Here is an example of how to use the `InsertAppendResults` selector:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.selector.InsertAppendResults
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.CandidatePipelineIdentifier
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery

val candidatePipeline1 = CandidatePipelineIdentifier("pipeline1")
val candidatePipeline2 = CandidatePipelineIdentifier("pipeline2")

val insertAppendResults = InsertAppendResults(Set(candidatePipeline1, candidatePipeline2))

val query = PipelineQuery()

val remainingCandidates = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)

val result = Seq(candidate4, candidate5)

val selectorResult = insertAppendResults(query, remainingCandidates, result)

val updatedRemainingCandidates = selectorResult.remainingCandidates

val updatedResult = selectorResult.result
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InsertAppendResults` object and how is it used?
   
   The `InsertAppendResults` object is used to select all candidates from one or more candidate pipelines and append them to the end of the result. It can be used by calling its `apply` method with a `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` or a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s to create an instance of `InsertAppendResults`, which can then be used as a `Selector` to modify a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects.

2. What is the `pipelineScope` property of the `InsertAppendResults` class and how is it used?
   
   The `pipelineScope` property of the `InsertAppendResults` class is a `CandidateScope` object that represents the set of candidate pipelines that the selector should operate on. It is used to partition the `remainingCandidates` sequence into two parts: `selectedCandidates`, which are the candidates from the specified pipelines, and `otherCandidates`, which are the candidates that were not selected.

3. What is the performance implication of calling `InsertAppendResults` multiple times with different `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s versus calling it once with a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s?
   
   If `InsertAppendResults` is called multiple times with different `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`s, each call will do an O(n) pass on the candidate pool, which can be slow if there are many candidates. It is more performant to include all (or a subset) of the candidate pipelines in a single `InsertAppendResults`, as each selector instance only needs to do one pass on the candidate pool.
