The `BaseDeepbirdV2Scorer` class is a Scala abstract class that defines the base functionality for a scorer component in the Deepbird system at Twitter. The purpose of this class is to provide a template for creating a scorer that can be used to score a set of candidates against a query. 

The class takes four type parameters: `Query`, `Candidate`, `QueryFeatures`, and `CandidateFeatures`. These parameters are used to define the types of the query, candidate, and their respective features. The class also takes an identifier for the scorer, a model selector, and sets of query, candidate, and result features. 

The class extends the `Scorer` trait, which defines the `apply` method that takes a query and a sequence of candidates and returns a sequence of feature maps. The `apply` method in this class first converts the candidate feature maps to Java data records and then to Scala data records. It then creates a `BatchPredictionRequest` object with the candidate data records and the query data record, if available. The `modelSelector` is used to select the appropriate model for the query. The `getBatchPredictions` method is called to get the batch predictions for the candidates using the selected model. The `buildResults` method is called to build the results from the predictions and the candidate feature maps. 

The `getBatchPredictions` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It takes a `BatchPredictionRequest` object and a `TModelSelector` object and returns a `Future` of a `BatchPredictionResponse` object. 

The `queryDataRecordConverter`, `candidateDataRecordConverter`, and `resultDataRecordExtractor` objects are used to convert the query, candidate, and result feature maps to and from data records. 

Overall, this class provides a base implementation for a scorer component in the Deepbird system at Twitter. Subclasses can extend this class to implement specific scoring functionality for their use case. 

Example usage:

```scala
class MyScorer extends BaseDeepbirdV2Scorer[MyQuery, MyCandidate, MyQueryFeatures, MyCandidateFeatures, MyResultFeatures](
  ScorerIdentifier("my_scorer"),
  ModelSelector[MyQuery](...),
  FeaturesScope[MyQueryFeatures](...),
  FeaturesScope[MyCandidateFeatures](...),
  Set[MyResultFeatures](...)
) {
  override def getBatchPredictions(
    request: BatchPredictionRequest,
    modelSelector: TModelSelector
  ): Future[BatchPredictionResponse] = {
    // implementation
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines an abstract class for a Deepbird V2 Scorer that extends the Scorer class. It provides methods for applying a model to a query and a set of candidates, and for getting batch predictions. It is used to score candidates based on a query and a set of features.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes a query and a sequence of candidates with features as inputs, and returns a Stitch of a sequence of FeatureMaps as output. The FeatureMaps represent the results of applying the model to the candidates.

3. What is the purpose of the `buildResults` method?
- The `buildResults` method takes a sequence of candidates with features and a sequence of DataRecords as inputs, and returns a sequence of FeatureMaps as output. It is used to extract the result features from the DataRecords and build FeatureMaps from them. It also checks that the size of the DataRecords matches the size of the candidates and throws an exception if they don't match.
