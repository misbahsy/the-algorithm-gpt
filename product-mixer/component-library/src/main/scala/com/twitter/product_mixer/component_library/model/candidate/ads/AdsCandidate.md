The code defines a model for an AdsCandidate, which represents a piece of promoted content. The AdsCandidate is a sealed trait that extends UniversalNoun and has a reference to the adImpression, which is a common thrift structure used by the Ads team to represent an ad. The AdsTweetCandidate is a final class that extends AdsCandidate and BaseTweetCandidate. It has an id and an adImpression, and it overrides the equals and hashCode methods for high performance. The AdsTweetCandidate also has a companion object that provides an apply method to create a new instance of the class.

This code is part of a larger project that involves serving ads on Twitter. The AdsCandidate model is used to represent promoted content, and the AdsTweetCandidate is a specific implementation of the AdsCandidate that represents promoted tweets. The adImpression field is a reference to the common thrift structure used by the Ads team to represent an ad, and it is consumed by the Goldfinch ads-injection library. The AdsTweetCandidate is a final class, which means that it cannot be extended, and its equals and hashCode methods are optimized for high performance. The companion object provides an apply method to create a new instance of the AdsTweetCandidate class. Overall, this code provides a model for representing promoted tweets in the larger Twitter ads project. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.adserver.{thriftscala => adsthrift}
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model.candidate.ads.AdsTweetCandidate

val adImpression = new adsthrift.AdImpression()
val adsTweetCandidate = AdsTweetCandidate(12345L, adImpression)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AdsCandidate` trait and how is it used in the code?
- The `AdsCandidate` trait represents a piece of promoted content and stores a reference to the `AdImpression` thrift structure used by the Ads team. It is used as a base trait for the `AdsTweetCandidate` class.

2. What is the significance of the `final` modifier on the `AdsTweetCandidate` class and why is it important to maintain it?
- The `final` modifier on the `AdsTweetCandidate` class ensures that it cannot be subclassed, which is important for the implementation of the `equals` method. If the `final` modifier is removed, the `equals` method must be updated to handle class inheritor equality.

3. What is the purpose of the `hashCode` method in the `AdsTweetCandidate` class and why is it cached as a val?
- The `hashCode` method in the `AdsTweetCandidate` class is used to compute a hash code for the object, which is used in hash-based data structures like hash maps. It is cached as a val to prevent the need to recompute the hash code on each `hashCode()` invocation, which can be expensive.
