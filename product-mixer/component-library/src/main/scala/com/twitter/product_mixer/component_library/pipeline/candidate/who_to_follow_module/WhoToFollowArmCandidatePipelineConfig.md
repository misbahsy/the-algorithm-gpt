This code defines a configuration object for a candidate pipeline module called "WhoToFollowArm" in the larger project. The purpose of this module is to generate a list of recommended Twitter accounts for a user to follow based on various criteria such as their interests, activity, and social connections. 

The configuration object contains two constants: MinCandidatesSize and MaxCandidatesSize, which define the minimum and maximum number of recommended accounts that can be generated by the module. These values can be adjusted as needed to optimize the performance and user experience of the module. 

The object also contains an identifier for the candidate pipeline module, which is used to uniquely identify and reference it within the larger project. This identifier is of type CandidatePipelineIdentifier, which is a custom data type defined in another part of the project. 

Overall, this code serves as a foundational component for the WhoToFollowArm candidate pipeline module, providing key configuration parameters and identification information. Other parts of the project can reference this object to access and utilize these parameters in generating and presenting recommended Twitter accounts to users. 

Example usage:
```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.pipeline.candidate.who_to_follow_module.WhoToFollowArmCandidatePipelineConfig

val minSize = WhoToFollowArmCandidatePipelineConfig.MinCandidatesSize
val maxSize = WhoToFollowArmCandidatePipelineConfig.MaxCandidatesSize
val pipelineId = WhoToFollowArmCandidatePipelineConfig.identifier

// Use the configuration parameters and identifier in generating recommended accounts
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines configuration parameters for the WhoToFollowArm candidate pipeline module in the product mixer component library of the larger project. 

2. What are the minimum and maximum sizes for the number of candidates in this pipeline? 
- The minimum size is 3 and the maximum size is 20. 

3. What is the significance of the CandidatePipelineIdentifier and how is it used? 
- The CandidatePipelineIdentifier is a unique identifier for the WhoToFollowArm candidate pipeline module, which is used to distinguish it from other candidate pipelines in the system.
