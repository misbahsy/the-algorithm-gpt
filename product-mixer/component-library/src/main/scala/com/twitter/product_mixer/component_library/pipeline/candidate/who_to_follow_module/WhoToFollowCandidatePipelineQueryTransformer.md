The code defines a transformer for a candidate pipeline query in the Who To Follow module of the Twitter product mixer component library. The transformer takes in a PipelineQuery object and returns a GetModuleRequest object from the PeopleDiscovery API. 

The WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer object defines some constants for the display location, supported layouts, and layout version. These values are used in the transform method to create the GetModuleRequest object. 

The WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer case class takes in four parameters: displayLocationParam, supportedLayoutsParam, layoutVersionParam, and excludedUserIdsFeature. The displayLocationParam and supportedLayoutsParam are parameters for the display location and supported layouts of the module. The layoutVersionParam is a parameter for the version of the layout. The excludedUserIdsFeature is an optional feature that excludes certain user IDs from the results. 

The transform method takes in a PipelineQuery object and returns a GetModuleRequest object. The PipelineQuery object contains information about the user, device, and context of the request. The transform method uses this information to create a ClientContext object for the PeopleDiscovery API. The display location, supported layouts, and layout version are set using the parameters passed into the case class. The excluded user IDs are set using the excludedUserIdsFeature if it is present. The includePromoted parameter is set to true to include promoted users in the results. 

Overall, this code is used to transform a PipelineQuery object into a GetModuleRequest object for the Who To Follow module of the Twitter product mixer component library. It is likely used in a larger system that handles recommendations for users on the Twitter platform. 

Example usage:
```
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val transformer = WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer(...)
val request = transformer.transform(query)
// use request to make API call to PeopleDiscovery API
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a transformer for a candidate pipeline query in the "Who to Follow" module of Twitter's product mixer component library. It transforms the input query into a `GetModuleRequest` object that can be used to retrieve a list of suggested users to follow.

2. What are the parameters of the `WhoToFollowCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer` case class?
- The case class takes in four parameters: `displayLocationParam`, `supportedLayoutsParam`, `layoutVersionParam`, and `excludedUserIdsFeature`. The first three are `Param` objects that specify the display location, supported layouts, and layout version of the query, respectively. The last parameter is an optional `Feature` object that represents a list of user IDs to exclude from the suggested users.

3. What is the significance of the `transform` method in this code?
- The `transform` method takes in an input query and returns a `GetModuleRequest` object that is used to retrieve a list of suggested users to follow. It uses the input query's parameters and features to populate the fields of the `GetModuleRequest` object, and sets the `includePromoted` field to `true`.
