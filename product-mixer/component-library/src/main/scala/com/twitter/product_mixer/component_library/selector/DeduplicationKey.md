The code provided is a Scala package containing two traits and two objects related to deduplication of candidates in a product mixer. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to detect duplicates in a list of candidates by defining a deduplication key. 

The `DeduplicationKey` trait is a generic trait that defines a method `apply` which takes an `ItemCandidateWithDetails` object and returns a key of type `Key`. This trait is used to define different deduplication keys for different use cases. 

The `IdAndClassDuplicationKey` object is an implementation of the `DeduplicationKey` trait that uses the candidate's id and class to determine duplicates. This approach is appropriate when the candidate sources return the same class of candidates. 

The `IdDuplicationKey` object is another implementation of the `DeduplicationKey` trait that uses only the candidate's id to determine duplicates. This approach is appropriate when the candidate sources return different sub-classes of the same candidate class. 

These deduplication keys can be used in the larger project to remove duplicates from a list of candidates before they are mixed. For example, the `IdAndClassDuplicationKey` can be used to remove duplicates when the candidate sources return the same class of candidates. The `IdDuplicationKey` can be used to remove duplicates when the candidate sources return different sub-classes of the same candidate class. 

Here is an example of how the `IdAndClassDuplicationKey` can be used to remove duplicates from a list of candidates:

```
val candidates: List[ItemCandidateWithDetails] = // list of candidates
val deduplicationKey = IdAndClassDuplicationKey
val deduplicatedCandidates = candidates.groupBy(deduplicationKey.apply).map(_._2.head)
```

In this example, the `candidates` list is deduplicated using the `IdAndClassDuplicationKey`. The `groupBy` method groups the candidates by their deduplication key, and the `map` method selects the first candidate from each group, effectively removing duplicates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DeduplicationKey` trait?
- The `DeduplicationKey` trait is used to define a method that generates a key for identifying duplicates in a list of `ItemCandidateWithDetails`.

2. What is the difference between `IdAndClassDuplicationKey` and `IdDuplicationKey`?
- `IdAndClassDuplicationKey` generates a key based on both the candidate's id and class, while `IdDuplicationKey` generates a key based only on the candidate's id. `IdDuplicationKey` is recommended for deduplicating across different candidate types.

3. What is the purpose of the `UniversalNoun` class?
- The `UniversalNoun` class is a common base class for all candidate types in the `com.twitter.product_mixer` package. It is used to ensure that all candidate types have certain common properties and methods.
