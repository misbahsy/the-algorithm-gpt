The `DropRequestedMaxResults` class is a selector component that limits the number of results returned by a pipeline query to the minimum of the requested maximum results and the server maximum results. 

The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects that have already been selected by previous selectors. It first retrieves the requested maximum results from the `PipelineQuery` object, using a default value if it is not set. It also retrieves the server maximum results from the `PipelineQuery` object. If either of these values is not greater than zero, an assertion error is thrown. 

The method then calculates the applied maximum results as the minimum of the requested maximum results and the server maximum results. It uses the `DropSelector` object to take the first `appliedMaxResults` items from the `result` sequence and returns a new `SelectorResult` object with the remaining candidates and the updated result sequence. 

This component can be used in a larger pipeline system to limit the number of results returned by a query to ensure that the system does not overload or exceed its capacity. For example, if a user requests a large number of results, this component can ensure that only a reasonable number of results are returned to the user. 

Here is an example of how this component can be used in a pipeline system:

```
val dropMaxResults = DropRequestedMaxResults(defaultRequestedMaxResultsParam, serverMaxResultsParam)
val pipeline = Pipeline(Seq(dropMaxResults, otherSelector1, otherSelector2))
val query = PipelineQuery(params = Map(serverMaxResultsParam -> 10))
val results = pipeline.run(query, candidates)
``` 

In this example, a `DropRequestedMaxResults` object is created with the appropriate parameters. It is then added to a pipeline along with other selectors. A `PipelineQuery` object is created with a parameter specifying the server maximum results. The pipeline is then run with the query and a sequence of candidate objects, and the resulting sequence of selected candidates is returned. The `DropRequestedMaxResults` component will ensure that the number of selected candidates is limited to the minimum of the requested maximum results and the server maximum results.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a selector called `DropRequestedMaxResults` that limits the number of results returned by a pipeline query to the minimum of the requested max results and the server max results parameters.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails`, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing the current result. It outputs a `SelectorResult` object containing the remaining candidates and the updated result.

3. What is the purpose of the `assert` statements in the `apply` method?
- The `assert` statements ensure that the requested max results and server max results parameters are greater than zero. If either of these parameters is not greater than zero, an exception will be thrown.
