The `FinagleHttpClientModule` object in the `http` package of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.module` package provides a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. The module uses the `TwitterModule` trait from the `com.twitter.inject` package to define the configuration flags for the HTTP client request timeout, transport connect timeout, and session acquisition timeout. The default values for these flags are 200 milliseconds, 500 milliseconds, and 500 milliseconds, respectively. 

The `providesFinagleHttpClient` method is annotated with `@Provides`, `@Singleton`, and `@Named(FinagleHttpClientModule)` to indicate that it provides a singleton instance of the Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. The method takes the following parameters:

- `requestTimeout`: the HTTP client request timeout
- `connectTimeout`: the HTTP client transport connect timeout
- `acquisitionTimeout`: the HTTP client session acquisition timeout
- `serviceIdentifier`: the service ID used to S2S Auth
- `statsReceiver`: the stats receiver

The method returns a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS that is built using the `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` method from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.http_client.FinagleHttpClientBuilder` object. The method passes the configuration flags and other parameters to the `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` method to create the HTTP client.

This module can be used in the larger project to provide a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS to other components that require it. For example, a service that needs to make HTTP requests to another service can use this module to obtain a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. The service can then use the HTTP client to make requests to the other service securely. 

Here is an example of how this module can be used in a service:

```scala
import com.twitter.finagle.Http
import com.twitter.finagle.mtls.authentication.ServiceIdentifier
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver
import javax.inject.Inject
import javax.inject.Named

class MyService @Inject() (
  @Named(FinagleHttpClientModule) httpClient: Http.Client,
  serviceIdentifier: ServiceIdentifier,
  statsReceiver: StatsReceiver
) {
  // Use the httpClient to make requests to another service
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS.

2. What are the default values for the timeouts?
- The default values for the request timeout, connect timeout, and session acquisition timeout are 200 milliseconds, 500 milliseconds, and 500 milliseconds, respectively.

3. Can the timeouts be customized?
- Yes, the timeouts can be customized by either overriding the flags or creating a local copy of the module.
