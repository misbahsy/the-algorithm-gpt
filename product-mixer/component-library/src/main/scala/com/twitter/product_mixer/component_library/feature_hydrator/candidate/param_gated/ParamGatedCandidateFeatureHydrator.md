The `ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` is a Scala class that extends the `CandidateFeatureHydrator` trait and is used to conditionally apply a feature hydrator based on a boolean parameter. The purpose of this class is to gate the execution of a feature hydrator based on the value of a parameter. 

The class takes two type parameters, `Query` and `Result`, which represent the domain model for the query or request and the type of the candidates, respectively. It also takes two constructor parameters: `enabledParam`, which is the parameter that controls whether the feature hydrator is enabled or not, and `candidateFeatureHydrator`, which is the underlying feature hydrator to run when `enabledParam` is true.

The class overrides several methods from the `CandidateFeatureHydrator` trait, including `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, and `apply`. The `identifier` method returns a unique identifier for the feature hydrator, while the `alerts` method returns a sequence of alerts associated with the feature hydrator. The `features` method returns a set of features associated with the feature hydrator. Finally, the `apply` method applies the feature hydrator to a given query, candidate, and existing feature map.

The `onlyIf` method is the key method in this class. It takes a query as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the feature hydrator should be applied or not. This method uses the `Conditionally.and` method to combine the query with the candidate feature hydrator and the boolean value of the `enabledParam` parameter. If the `enabledParam` parameter is true, the feature hydrator is applied, otherwise it is not.

The `ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` class is useful in situations where a feature hydrator should only be applied conditionally based on a parameter value. For example, if a feature hydrator is computationally expensive, it may be desirable to only apply it when a certain parameter is set to true. This class provides a simple way to gate the execution of a feature hydrator based on a parameter value. 

Example usage:

```scala
val param = Param[Boolean]("myParam", true)
val featureHydrator = MyFeatureHydrator()
val gatedFeatureHydrator = ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator(param, featureHydrator)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a `ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` class that extends `CandidateFeatureHydrator` and is conditionally based on a `Param`. It is likely used to selectively enable or disable a feature hydrator based on a parameter value. It is part of the `feature_hydrator` component library in the larger project.

2. What are the input and output types for the `ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` class? 
- The input types are a `PipelineQuery` and a `UniversalNoun` of any type, and the output type is a `Stitch` of `FeatureMap`.

3. What is the purpose of the `IdentifierPrefix` object in the `ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator` companion object? 
- The `IdentifierPrefix` object is a string value that is used to prefix the name of the underlying `CandidateFeatureHydrator` identifier when creating the identifier for the `ParamGatedCandidateFeatureHydrator`. This is likely done to differentiate it from other feature hydrators and make it easier to identify in logs or other output.
