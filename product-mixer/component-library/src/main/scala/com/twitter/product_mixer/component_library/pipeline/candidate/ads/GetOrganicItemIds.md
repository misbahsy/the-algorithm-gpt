The code provided defines three classes that are used to retrieve organic item candidates from a set of previous candidates. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to filter out organic item candidates from a larger set of candidates based on specified pipelines.

The first class, `GetOrganicItemIds`, is a trait that defines a method `apply` which takes a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects and returns an optional sequence of `Long` values. This trait is used as a base for the other two classes.

The second class, `PipelineScopedOrganicItemIds`, is a case class that takes a `CandidateScope` object as a parameter and extends the `GetOrganicItemIds` trait. The `apply` method of this class filters the `previousCandidates` sequence based on whether the `pipelines` object contains the candidate's scope. If the candidate's scope is contained in the `pipelines` object, the candidate's `candidateIdLong` is added to the resulting sequence. If no candidates are found, `None` is returned.

The third class, `EmptyOrganicItemIds`, is an object that extends the `GetOrganicItemIds` trait. The `apply` method of this class always returns `None`, effectively returning an empty sequence of organic item candidates.

This code can be used in a larger project to retrieve organic item candidates from a set of previous candidates based on specified pipelines. For example, if a project has a set of candidates and wants to retrieve only organic item candidates that belong to a certain pipeline, they can use the `PipelineScopedOrganicItemIds` class to filter the candidates. If there are no organic item candidates, they can use the `EmptyOrganicItemIds` class to return an empty sequence. Overall, this code provides a flexible way to retrieve organic item candidates based on specified pipelines.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetOrganicItemIds` trait?
- The `GetOrganicItemIds` trait defines a method for getting organic item candidates from a sequence of previous candidates.

2. What is the difference between `PipelineScopedOrganicItemIds` and `EmptyOrganicItemIds`?
- `PipelineScopedOrganicItemIds` returns a sequence of organic item IDs from previous candidates that match a specified set of pipelines, while `EmptyOrganicItemIds` returns an empty sequence.

3. What is the input type for the `apply` method in each of the classes?
- The input type for the `apply` method in each of the classes is a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails`.
