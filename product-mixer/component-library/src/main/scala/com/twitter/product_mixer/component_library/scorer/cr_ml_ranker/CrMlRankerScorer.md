The `CrMlRankerScorer` class is a scorer component that scores tweets using the Content Recommender ML Light Ranker. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to score tweets based on their relevance to a user's query. It takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects, and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]` object. 

The `CrMlRankerScorer` class uses the `CrMlRankerScoreStitchClient` to get the score for each candidate tweet. The score is calculated using the `getScore` method of the `CrMlRankerScoreStitchClient` class. The `getScore` method takes in the user ID, candidate tweet, ranking configuration, and common features as parameters, and returns a `Stitch[CrMlRankerScore]` object. 

The `CrMlRankerScorer` class uses the `Stitch.collect` method to collect the scores for all the candidate tweets. It then maps the scores to a `FeatureMap` object using the `FeatureMapBuilder` class. The `CrMlRankerScore` object is used to store the score for each candidate tweet.

This class can be used in the larger project to score tweets based on their relevance to a user's query. For example, it can be used in a search engine to rank tweets based on their relevance to a user's search query. 

Example usage:

```
val scorer = new CrMlRankerScorer(crMlRanker)
val query = new PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(new CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate](tweetCandidate, featureMap))
val scores = scorer.apply(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a scorer class that scores tweets using the Content Recommender ML Light Ranker.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `CrMlRankerCommonFeatures`, `CrMlRankerRankingConfig`, `TweetCandidate`, `Feature`, `FeatureMap`, `Scorer`, `CandidateWithFeatures`, `ScorerIdentifier`, `PipelineQuery`, and `Stitch`.

3. How does the `apply` method work?
- The `apply` method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` as input, and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`. It extracts the `CrMlRankerRankingConfig` and `CrMlRankerCommonFeatures` from the query's feature map, and uses them to get scores for each candidate using the `crMlRanker` object. It then builds a `FeatureMap` for each score and returns a sequence of them wrapped in a `Stitch`.
