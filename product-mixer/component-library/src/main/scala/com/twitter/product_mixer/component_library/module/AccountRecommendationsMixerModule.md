The `AccountRecommendationsMixerModule` is a module that provides a default implementation for a Thrift client that communicates with the Account Recommendations Mixer service. This module is designed to be used in a larger project that requires communication with the Account Recommendations Mixer service.

The module is implemented as a Scala object that extends the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` and `MtlsClient` traits. The `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` trait provides a convenient way to create a Thrift client using the Finagle library, while the `MtlsClient` trait provides support for mutual TLS authentication.

The module provides two flags that can be used to configure the timeouts for the client: `AccountRecommendationsMixerTimeoutPerRequest` and `AccountRecommendationsMixerTimeoutTotal`. These flags have default values of 800 milliseconds and 1200 milliseconds, respectively. The `configureMethodBuilder` method is overridden to set the timeouts for the client using the values of these flags.

The `idempotent` method is called on the `MethodBuilder` object to indicate that the client is idempotent. This means that if the client sends the same request multiple times, the server will only process the request once. The `idempotent` method takes a percentage as an argument, which represents the probability that the server will return the same response for the same request.

The `label` and `dest` properties are set to "account-recs-mixer" and "/s/account-recs-mixer/account-recs-mixer:thrift", respectively. These properties are used by Finagle to identify the service that the client is communicating with.

Overall, the `AccountRecommendationsMixerModule` provides a convenient way to create a Thrift client that communicates with the Account Recommendations Mixer service. The module provides reasonable defaults for timeouts and other settings, but these can be customized if necessary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is an implementation of an idempotent Account Recommendations Mixer Thrift client with default timeouts and settings. It configures per request and total timeouts and sets a label and destination for the client.

2. What are the default timeout values for this implementation?
- The default timeout values are 800 milliseconds for per request and 1200 milliseconds for total.

3. Can the timeout values be customized for a specific use case?
- Yes, the timeout values can be further tuned for a specific use case by creating a local copy of this module for the service. The default values are only meant to be a reasonable starting point.
