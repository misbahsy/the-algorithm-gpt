The code defines a trait called `ModelFeatureExtractor` that is used to extract features from outputted tensors in order to score candidates. The trait takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Result`. The `Query` type parameter is a subtype of `PipelineQuery`, which is a class used in the larger project to represent a query being processed by a pipeline. The `Result` type parameter represents the type of value being returned by the extractor.

The `ModelFeatureExtractor` trait has a single method called `apply` that takes two arguments: a `Query` object and a sequence of `InferOutputTensor` objects. The `InferOutputTensor` class is defined in an external package called `inference.GrpcService` and represents a tensor outputted by a machine learning model.

The purpose of the `apply` method is to extract features from the tensor output and return a sequence of `Result` objects. The implementation of the method is left to the user, who can pass in an anonymous function to define the extraction logic.

This trait is likely used in the larger project to define how a Scorer component should extract features from the output of a machine learning model in order to score candidates. The `ModelFeatureExtractor` trait provides a flexible way for users to define their own feature extraction logic, allowing for customization and experimentation with different approaches.

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.scorer.cortex.ModelFeatureExtractor
import inference.GrpcService.ModelInferResponse.InferOutputTensor
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery

// Define a custom feature extractor for a specific type of query
class MyFeatureExtractor extends ModelFeatureExtractor[MyQuery, Double] {
  def apply(query: MyQuery, tensorOutput: Seq[InferOutputTensor]): Seq[Double] = {
    // Extract features from tensor output and return a sequence of Doubles
    // ...
  }
}

// Use the custom feature extractor in a Scorer component
val myScorer = new Scorer[MyQuery, Double](new MyFeatureExtractor)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a trait for a model feature extractor used in the Scorer component of the Cortex library within the Product Mixer project at Twitter.

2. What is the significance of the `[-Query <: PipelineQuery, Result]` syntax in the trait definition?
- This syntax defines type parameters for the trait, where `Query` must be a subtype of `PipelineQuery` and `Result` is the type of the value being returned by the extractor.

3. How does the `apply` method use the `tensorOutput` parameter to generate the `Seq[Result]` output?
- The `apply` method takes in a `Query` object and a sequence of `InferOutputTensor` objects, and uses them to generate a sequence of `Result` objects. The specific implementation of this method will depend on the use case for the model feature extractor.
