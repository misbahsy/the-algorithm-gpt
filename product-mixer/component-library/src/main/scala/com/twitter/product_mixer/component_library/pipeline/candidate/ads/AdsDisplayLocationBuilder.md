This code defines a trait and a case class that are used to build an ads display location for a given query. The trait, `AdsDisplayLocationBuilder`, takes a type parameter `Query` that must be a subtype of `PipelineQuery` and `AdsQuery`. It defines a single abstract method, `apply`, that takes a query of type `Query` and returns an `ads.DisplayLocation` object.

The case class, `StaticAdsDisplayLocationBuilder`, extends `AdsDisplayLocationBuilder` and takes a single argument, a `displayLocation` of type `ads.DisplayLocation`. It implements the `apply` method by simply returning the `displayLocation` argument.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves serving ads to users based on their queries. The `AdsDisplayLocationBuilder` trait allows for different implementations of how to build an ads display location based on a given query. The `StaticAdsDisplayLocationBuilder` case class provides a simple implementation that always returns the same display location, which may be useful for testing or for cases where the display location is fixed.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
val query = MyAdsQuery(...) // create an instance of a custom ads query
val builder = StaticAdsDisplayLocationBuilder(ads.DisplayLocation("my_location"))
val displayLocation = builder(query) // returns the same display location for any query
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is defining a trait and a case class for building display locations for ads in a pipeline. It likely fits into a larger system for serving ads on Twitter.
2. What is the significance of the `[-Query <: PipelineQuery with AdsQuery]` syntax in the trait definition?
- This syntax is defining a type parameter `Query` that must be a subtype of `PipelineQuery` and `AdsQuery`. This ensures that any implementation of the trait will work with queries that have both pipeline and ads-related properties.
3. How is the `StaticAdsDisplayLocationBuilder` case class different from other implementations of the `AdsDisplayLocationBuilder` trait?
- The `StaticAdsDisplayLocationBuilder` case class takes a pre-defined `ads.DisplayLocation` as a parameter and always returns that same location, regardless of the input query. Other implementations of the trait may calculate the display location based on properties of the input query.
