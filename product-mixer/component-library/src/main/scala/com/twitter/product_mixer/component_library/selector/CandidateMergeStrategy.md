The code defines a set of classes and traits that are used to merge duplicate candidates in a product mixer system. The product mixer system is used to combine different types of content (e.g. tweets, images, videos) into a single feed. When merging candidates, the system needs to decide which candidate to keep and how to combine the features of the duplicate candidates.

The `CandidateMergeStrategy` trait defines a custom behavior for resolving duplication. It has a single method `apply` that takes two `ItemCandidateWithDetails` objects (the existing candidate and the new candidate) and returns a single `ItemCandidateWithDetails` object. The `PickFirstCandidateMerger` object is a simple implementation of `CandidateMergeStrategy` that keeps whichever candidate was encountered first. The `CombineFeatureMapsCandidateMerger` object is a more complex implementation that keeps the candidate encountered first but combines all candidate feature maps. The `PickPinnedCandidateMerger` object is another implementation that keeps the pinnable candidate. It prioritizes the candidate with `IsPinnedFeature` because it contains additional information needed for the positioning of a pinned entry on a timeline.

The `ItemCandidateWithDetails` class represents a candidate with additional details such as features and source position. The `features` field is a map of feature names to feature values. The `FeatureMapBuilder` class is used to build feature maps. The `CandidateSources`, `CandidatePipelines`, and `CandidateSourcePosition` objects are feature names that are used to identify the source, pipeline, and position of a candidate.

These classes and traits are used in the larger product mixer system to merge duplicate candidates. The system can use one of the predefined merge strategies or define a custom merge strategy by implementing the `CandidateMergeStrategy` trait. For example, the system can use the `PickFirstCandidateMerger` strategy to keep the first encountered candidate or the `PickPinnedCandidateMerger` strategy to prioritize pinnable candidates. The `CombineFeatureMapsCandidateMerger` strategy can be used to combine feature maps of duplicate candidates. 

Example usage of `PickFirstCandidateMerger`:
```
val existingCandidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(...)
val newCandidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(...)
val mergedCandidate = PickFirstCandidateMerger(existingCandidate, newCandidate)
```

Example usage of `CombineFeatureMapsCandidateMerger`:
```
val existingCandidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(features = Map(CandidateSources -> Set("source1")))
val newCandidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(features = Map(CandidateSources -> Set("source2"), CandidatePipelines -> Set("pipeline1")))
val mergedCandidate = CombineFeatureMapsCandidateMerger(existingCandidate, newCandidate)
// mergedCandidate.features = Map(CandidateSources -> Set("source1", "source2"), CandidatePipelines -> Set("pipeline1"))
```

Example usage of `PickPinnedCandidateMerger`:
```
val existingCandidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(new BaseTweetCandidate(...), features = Map(IsPinnedFeature -> true))
val newCandidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(new BaseTweetCandidate(...))
val mergedCandidate = PickPinnedCandidateMerger(existingCandidate, newCandidate)
// mergedCandidate is existingCandidate because it has IsPinnedFeature
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CandidateMergeStrategy` trait and its implementations?
   
   The `CandidateMergeStrategy` trait and its implementations define how to resolve duplicate candidates in a product mixer. They provide custom behavior for resolving duplication based on different criteria, such as keeping the first candidate, combining feature maps, or prioritizing pinnable candidates.

2. What are `CandidateSources`, `CandidatePipelines`, and `CandidateSourcePosition`?
   
   `CandidateSources`, `CandidatePipelines`, and `CandidateSourcePosition` are feature keys used to store information about the sources, pipelines, and positions of candidates in a product mixer. They are used in the `CombineFeatureMapsCandidateMerger` implementation to merge the feature maps of two candidates.

3. What is the purpose of the `PickPinnedCandidateMerger` implementation?
   
   The `PickPinnedCandidateMerger` implementation is used to prioritize pinnable candidates when resolving duplicate candidates in a product mixer. It keeps the candidate with the `IsPinnedFeature` set to `true`, which contains additional information needed for the positioning of a pinned entry on a timeline.
