The InterestsDiscoveryServiceModule is a Scala object that provides a Thrift client for the InterestsDiscoveryService. This module is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The InterestsDiscoveryService is a service that allows users to discover interests based on their activity on Twitter. The InterestsDiscoveryServiceModule provides a client for this service that can be used to make requests to the service. 

The module extends the ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule, which is a module that provides a Thrift client for a given service. The InterestsDiscoveryServiceModule specifies the service and method per endpoint for the InterestsDiscoveryService. 

The module also extends the MtlsClient trait, which is a trait that provides support for mutual TLS authentication. This allows the client to authenticate with the server using certificates. 

The InterestsDiscoveryServiceModule provides a method for configuring the MethodBuilder used to create the Thrift client. The method sets the timeout per request to 500 milliseconds and the total timeout to 1000 milliseconds. It also sets the idempotent percentage to 5 percent. 

The module also provides a sessionAcquisitionTimeout method that sets the timeout for acquiring a session to 500 milliseconds. 

Overall, the InterestsDiscoveryServiceModule provides a client for the InterestsDiscoveryService that can be used to make requests to the service. The module also provides support for mutual TLS authentication and allows for configuration of the MethodBuilder used to create the Thrift client. 

Example usage:

```scala
val client = InterestsDiscoveryServiceModule.client
val response = client.getInterests(userId)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a Thrift client that connects to an InterestsDiscoveryService. It configures the method builder with timeouts and idempotency settings.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several libraries, including com.twitter.interests_discovery.thriftscala, com.twitter.finagle.thriftmux, and com.twitter.inject.

3. What is the significance of the MtlsClient trait being extended?
- The MtlsClient trait is used to enable mutual TLS authentication for the Thrift client. This ensures that both the client and server are authenticated and encrypted for secure communication.
