The `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` is a Scala class that extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class and adds a conditional gating mechanism based on a `Param`. The purpose of this class is to enable or disable the underlying `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` based on the value of a `Param`. 

The `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Result`. `Query` represents the domain model for the query or request, while `Result` represents the type of the candidates. The class takes two constructor parameters: `enabledParam` and `bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`. `enabledParam` is the `Param` that controls whether the `bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` is enabled or disabled. `bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` is the underlying `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` that is run when `enabledParam` is true.

The class overrides several methods from the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class, including `identifier`, `alerts`, `features`, and `apply`. The `identifier` method returns a `FeatureHydratorIdentifier` that is based on the name of the underlying `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`. The `alerts` method returns a sequence of alerts from the underlying `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`. The `features` method returns a set of features from the underlying `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`. The `apply` method takes a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[FeatureMap]` that represents the features for each candidate.

The `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class also implements the `Conditionally` trait, which provides the `onlyIf` method. The `onlyIf` method takes a `Query` and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the `bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` should be run based on the value of the `enabledParam`. The `onlyIf` method uses the `Conditionally.and` method to combine the `Query` with the `bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` and the `enabledParam`.

The `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class is used in the larger project to enable or disable the underlying `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` based on the value of a `Param`. This allows for more fine-grained control over the features that are generated for each candidate. For example, if a certain feature is causing performance issues, it can be disabled by setting the `enabledParam` to false. Conversely, if a new feature is added that is not yet fully tested, it can be disabled by default until it is fully tested and verified. 

Example usage:

```
val bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator = new MyBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator()
val enabledParam = new Param[Boolean]("my_feature_enabled", true)
val paramGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator = ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator(enabledParam, bulkCandidateFeatureHydrator)
val query = new MyQuery()
val candidates = Seq(new MyCandidateWithFeatures())
val features = paramGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator(query, candidates).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a class called `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` that extends `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` and is conditionally enabled based on a `Param`. It is part of the `feature_hydrator` component library in the larger project.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class? 
- The `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class takes in a `Param[Boolean]` and a `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator[Query, Result]` and outputs a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`.

3. What is the purpose of the `IdentifierPrefix` object in the `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` companion object? 
- The `IdentifierPrefix` object is a string that is used to prefix the name of the `ParamGatedBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` identifier.
