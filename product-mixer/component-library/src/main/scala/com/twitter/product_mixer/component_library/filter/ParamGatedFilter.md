The `ParamGatedFilter` is a Scala class that extends the `Filter` class and is used to conditionally filter a list of candidates based on a specified parameter. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to turn a filter on and off based on a boolean parameter. This is useful when you want to apply a filter only when a certain condition is met.

The `ParamGatedFilter` takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Candidate`. `Query` is the domain model for the query or request, while `Candidate` is the type of the candidates. The class has two properties: `enabledParam` and `filter`. `enabledParam` is the parameter that determines whether the filter is enabled or not. `filter` is the underlying filter that is applied when `enabledParam` is true.

The `ParamGatedFilter` class has two methods: `onlyIf` and `apply`. The `onlyIf` method takes a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]` and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the filter should be applied or not. The method uses the `Conditionally.and` method to combine the input, the filter, and the value of the `enabledParam` parameter to determine whether the filter should be applied. The `apply` method takes a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]` and applies the underlying filter to the candidates.

The `ParamGatedFilter` class is used in the larger project to conditionally filter a list of candidates based on a specified parameter. For example, if you have a list of candidates and you want to filter them based on a boolean parameter, you can use the `ParamGatedFilter` class to conditionally apply a filter to the candidates. Here is an example of how to use the `ParamGatedFilter` class:

```scala
val candidates: Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]] = ???
val query: Query = ???
val enabledParam: Param[Boolean] = ???
val filter: Filter[Query, Candidate] = ???

val paramGatedFilter = ParamGatedFilter(enabledParam, filter)
val filteredCandidates = paramGatedFilter.apply(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a filter component for a product mixing pipeline that is conditionally enabled based on a specified parameter. It is part of the larger project for product mixing on Twitter.

2. What are the input and output types for the `ParamGatedFilter` class?
- The input types are a domain model for the query or request (`Query`) and a type of candidates (`Candidate`). The output type is a `FilterResult` for the candidate type.

3. What is the significance of the `IdentifierPrefix` value in the `ParamGatedFilter` object?
- The `IdentifierPrefix` value is used to generate the identifier for the filter component. It is prefixed to the name of the underlying filter's identifier to create a unique identifier for the `ParamGatedFilter`.
