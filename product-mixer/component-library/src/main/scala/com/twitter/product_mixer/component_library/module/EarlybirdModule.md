The `EarlybirdModule` object is a module for creating a ThriftMux client for the Earlybird service. The Earlybird service is a search service that allows users to search for tweets based on certain criteria. The purpose of this module is to provide a way for other components in the larger project to interact with the Earlybird service.

The module extends the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` class, which provides a way to create a ThriftMux client using a method builder. The `MtlsClient` trait is also mixed in, which adds support for mutual TLS authentication.

The module defines two flags, `EarlybirdTimeoutPerRequest` and `EarlybirdTimeoutTotal`, which control the timeout values for requests to the Earlybird service. These flags have default values of 200 milliseconds and 400 milliseconds, respectively. These values can be overridden by passing in different values when creating an instance of the module.

The `dest` and `label` values are also defined, which specify the destination and label for the ThriftMux client. The destination is set to `/s/earlybird-root-superroot/root-superroot`, which is the endpoint for the Earlybird service. The label is set to "earlybird".

The `configureMethodBuilder` method is overridden to configure the method builder used to create the ThriftMux client. The method builder is configured with the timeout values specified by the `EarlybirdTimeoutPerRequest` and `EarlybirdTimeoutTotal` flags. The `idempotent` method is also called with a value of 5 percent, which indicates that the method is idempotent with a probability of 5 percent.

The `configureThriftMuxClient` method is also overridden to configure the ThriftMux client. The client is configured to use the `TCompactProtocol` protocol factory.

Finally, the `sessionAcquisitionTimeout` method is overridden to set the session acquisition timeout to 1 second.

Overall, this module provides a way for other components in the larger project to create a ThriftMux client for the Earlybird service with configurable timeout values and support for mutual TLS authentication. Here is an example of how this module might be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.inject.Injector
import com.twitter.inject.app.App
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.module.EarlybirdModule
import com.twitter.search.earlybird.thriftscala.EarlybirdService

object MyApplication extends App {
  override val modules = Seq(EarlybirdModule)

  val injector: Injector = createInjector()

  val client: EarlybirdService.MethodPerEndpoint =
    injector.instance[EarlybirdService.MethodPerEndpoint]

  val result = client.searchTweets("my query")
  println(result)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a ThriftMux client that connects to an Earlybird service. It sets timeout values and protocol factory for the client.

2. What are the default timeout values for Earlybird requests?
- The default timeout per request is 200 milliseconds and the default total timeout is 400 milliseconds.

3. What is the significance of the `idempotent` method call in the `configureMethodBuilder` method?
- The `idempotent` method call sets the percentage of requests that can be retried in case of a failure. In this case, it is set to 5 percent.
