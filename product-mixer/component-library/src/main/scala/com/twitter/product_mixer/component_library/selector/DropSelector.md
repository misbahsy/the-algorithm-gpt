The `DropSelector` object provides two methods for filtering and deduplicating a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects. The first method, `dropDuplicates`, takes a sequence of candidates and removes any duplicates based on a key generated by the `duplicationKey` function. If two candidates have the same key, the `mergeStrategy` function is used to determine which candidate to keep. By default, the first candidate is kept. The method only operates on `ItemCandidateWithDetails` objects that are not `CursorCandidate` or `ModuleCandidateWithDetails`. The resulting sequence of candidates is returned.

The second method, `takeUntil`, takes a sequence of candidates and returns a subset of the candidates up to a maximum number of non-cursor candidates specified by the `max` parameter. The method only includes candidates that are in the provided `pipelineScope` and are not `CursorCandidate`. The resulting sequence of candidates is returned.

These methods are likely used in the larger project to filter and deduplicate candidates before they are presented to the user. For example, the `dropDuplicates` method may be used to remove duplicate candidates that were generated by different pipelines. The `takeUntil` method may be used to limit the number of candidates presented to the user to a manageable number. 

Example usage of `dropDuplicates`:
```
val candidates: Seq[ItemCandidateWithDetails] = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)
val deduplicatedCandidates = DropSelector.dropDuplicates(
  pipelineScope = CandidateScope(Seq(pipeline1, pipeline2)),
  candidates = candidates,
  duplicationKey = (candidate: ItemCandidateWithDetails) => candidate.candidate.id,
  mergeStrategy = (original: ItemCandidateWithDetails, duplicate: ItemCandidateWithDetails) => original
)
```

Example usage of `takeUntil`:
```
val candidates: Seq[ItemCandidateWithDetails] = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)
val maxCandidates = 10
val pipelineScope = CandidateScope(Seq(pipeline1, pipeline2))
val filteredCandidates = DropSelector.takeUntil(maxCandidates, candidates, pipelineScope)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DropSelector` object?
- The `DropSelector` object is used to identify and merge duplicates in a sequence of candidates using key extraction and merger functions.

2. What types of candidates are ignored by the `dropDuplicates` method?
- The `dropDuplicates` method ignores `CursorCandidate` and `ModuleCandidateWithDetails` types of candidates.

3. What does the `takeUntil` method do?
- The `takeUntil` method takes a maximum number of non-cursor candidates from a sequence of candidates, where only candidates in the provided pipeline scope are counted towards the maximum.
