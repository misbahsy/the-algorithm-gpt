The code defines a model class called `FundingSourceCandidate` that represents a funding instrument from the Ad Management perspective. This class extends the `UniversalNoun` class and has two fields: `id` and `adAccountId`. The `id` field is of type `Long` and represents the unique identifier of the funding instrument, while the `adAccountId` field is also of type `Long` and represents the identifier of the Ad Account associated with the funding instrument.

The class has an `equals` method that compares two `FundingSourceCandidate` objects for equality. The method first checks if the two objects are the same instance, then checks if their hash codes are equal, and finally checks if their `id` and `adAccountId` fields are equal. The class also has a `hashCode` method that computes a hash code for the object based on its `id` and `adAccountId` fields.

The code also includes a companion object for the `FundingSourceCandidate` class that defines an `apply` method. This method takes two arguments, `id` and `adAccountId`, and returns a new instance of the `FundingSourceCandidate` class with those values.

The purpose of this code is to provide a canonical model for representing funding instruments from the Ad Management perspective. The `FundingSourceCandidate` class can be used throughout the project to represent funding instruments and to compare them for equality. The `apply` method in the companion object provides a convenient way to create new instances of the class. The `equals` and `hashCode` methods ensure that instances of the class can be compared and hashed correctly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a FundingSourceCandidate model for Ad Management, which describes a "Funding Instrument". It solves the problem of representing and managing funding sources for ads.

2. What are the constraints for caching the hashCode and why is it important?
- The constraints for caching the hashCode are that all fields used to construct the hashCode must be immutable, including the object reference and instance. It is important to cache the hashCode to prevent the need to recompute it on each hashCode() invocation.

3. What is the significance of the final modifier on the FundingSourceCandidate class and why must the equals() implementation be updated if it is removed?
- The final modifier on the FundingSourceCandidate class means that it cannot be inherited by other classes. If the final modifier is removed, the equals() implementation must be updated to handle class inheritor equality, as the current implementation only works for the final class.
