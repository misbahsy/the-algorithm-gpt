This code defines two classes, `DMConvoCandidate` and `DMConvoSearchCandidate`, which are both implementations of the `BaseDMConvoCandidate` trait. These classes represent candidates for a direct message conversation on Twitter. 

The `DMConvoCandidate` class is the canonical model and should be preferred over other variants. It takes in an `id` of type `String` and an optional `lastReadableEventId` of type `Long`. The `DMConvoSearchCandidate` class is similar, but is intended for use in search contexts. 

Both classes override the `canEqual` method to check if an object is an instance of the same class, and the `equals` method to compare the `id` and `lastReadableEventId` fields. They also override the `hashCode` method to cache the hash code as a val, which is instantiated once on object construction. 

The code also includes notes on how to add additional fields to the candidates using the `Feature` class and how to extract features from the candidate source response using the `CandidateFeatureHydrator` and `CandidatePipelineConfig` classes. 

Overall, this code provides a standardized model for direct message conversation candidates on Twitter, with a focus on performance and consistency. It can be used in various parts of the larger project, such as candidate selection and feature extraction. 

Example usage:
```
val convoCandidate = DMConvoCandidate("12345", Some(67890))
val searchCandidate = DMConvoSearchCandidate("67890", None)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseDMConvoCandidate` trait?
- The `BaseDMConvoCandidate` trait extends `UniversalNoun[String]` and defines a method for retrieving the last readable event ID. It is likely used as a base trait for other candidate models.

2. What is the difference between `DMConvoCandidate` and `DMConvoSearchCandidate`?
- Both `DMConvoCandidate` and `DMConvoSearchCandidate` are candidate models, but they likely serve different purposes. The code suggests that `DMConvoCandidate` is the canonical model and should be preferred over other variants.

3. Why is the `hashCode` value cached as a `val`?
- The `hashCode` value is cached as a `val` to prevent the need to recompute it on each `hashCode()` invocation. This is because the Scala compiler-generated `hashCode()` method cannot make assumptions about field object mutability and `hashCode` implementations.
