The `UndecoratedUrtDomainMarshaller` class is a decorator that generates URT (Unified Rich Timeline) entries from only candidate IDs. This is useful for fast prototyping, as it does not require any ItemPresentations or ModulePresentations from candidate pipeline decorators. 

The class extends `DomainMarshaller` and `UrtBuilder`, and takes in a `PipelineQuery` type parameter. It also has several optional parameters, including `instructionBuilders`, `cursorBuilders`, `cursorUpdaters`, `metadataBuilder`, `sortIndexStep`, and `identifier`. 

The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails`, and returns a `Timeline`. It maps over the `CandidateWithDetails` sequence and creates an `ArticleItem`, `AudioSpaceItem`, `TopicItem`, `TweetItem`, `TwitterListItem`, or `UserItem` depending on the type of candidate. If the candidate has a presentation or module presentation, an exception is thrown. 

Overall, this class is a useful tool for generating URT entries quickly and easily during the prototyping phase of a project. It can be used in conjunction with other decorators and pipeline components to create a more robust URT system. 

Example usage:

```
val marshaller = UndecoratedUrtDomainMarshaller()
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(ArticleCandidate(...), TweetCandidate(...))
val timeline = marshaller(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a decorator that generates URT entries from candidate IDs for fast prototyping. It is used as a DomainMarshaller in the project's pipeline for generating timelines.

2. What are the different types of candidates that this code handles?
- This code handles ArticleCandidate, AudioSpaceCandidate, TopicCandidate, TweetCandidate, TwitterListCandidate, and UserCandidate.

3. What exceptions can be thrown by this code and why?
- This code can throw UnsupportedCandidateDomainMarshallerException if it encounters a candidate that it does not support. It can also throw UnsupportedPresentationDomainMarshallerException if it encounters a candidate with a presentation that it does not support, and UnsupportedModuleDomainMarshallerException if it encounters a module presentation that it does not support. These exceptions are thrown to indicate that the code cannot handle certain types of candidates or presentations.
