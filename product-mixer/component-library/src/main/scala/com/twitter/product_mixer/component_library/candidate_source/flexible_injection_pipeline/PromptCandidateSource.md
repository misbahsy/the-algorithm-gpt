The `PromptCandidateSource` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It is responsible for returning a list of prompts to insert into a user's timeline from go/flip, which is the prompting platform for Twitter. This class extends the `CandidateSource` class and takes in a `TaskService` object as a parameter. The `TaskService` object is used to make a call to the `getInjections` method, which returns a list of injections. The `PromptCandidateSource` class then maps over the list of injections and creates a list of `IntermediatePrompt` objects. 

The `IntermediatePrompt` case class is used to help with the "explosion" of tile carousel tiles due to `TimelineModule` not being an extension of `TimelineItem`. It takes in an `injection` object, which is an instance of the `Injection` class from the `injectionsthrift` package. It also takes in an `offsetInModule` and a `carouselTile` object, which are both optional. The `offsetInModule` object is used to keep track of the index of the tile in the carousel, while the `carouselTile` object is used to store the tile itself.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to retrieve a list of prompts to insert into a user's timeline. This can be used in the larger project to improve user engagement by providing relevant and timely prompts to users. The `PromptCandidateSource` class can be used by other components in the project to retrieve a list of prompts and display them to the user. For example, a `TimelineModule` component could use the `PromptCandidateSource` class to retrieve a list of prompts and display them in the user's timeline. 

Example usage:

```
val taskService = new servicethrift.TaskService.MethodPerEndpoint(...)
val promptCandidateSource = new PromptCandidateSource(taskService)
val request = new servicethrift.GetInjectionsRequest(...)
val prompts = promptCandidateSource(request).get
// do something with the list of prompts
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a candidate source for prompts to insert into a user's timeline from the prompting platform for Twitter.
2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies such as `com.twitter.inject.Logging`, `com.twitter.onboarding.injections`, `com.twitter.onboarding.task.service`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.candidate_source.CandidateSource`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.CandidateSourceIdentifier`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, `javax.inject.Inject`, and `javax.inject.Singleton`.
3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `servicethrift.GetInjectionsRequest` and returns a `Stitch[Seq[IntermediatePrompt]]`. The `IntermediatePrompt` is a case class that contains an `injection` of type `injectionsthrift.Injection`, an optional `offsetInModule` of type `Int`, and an optional `carouselTile` of type `injectionsthrift.Tile`.
