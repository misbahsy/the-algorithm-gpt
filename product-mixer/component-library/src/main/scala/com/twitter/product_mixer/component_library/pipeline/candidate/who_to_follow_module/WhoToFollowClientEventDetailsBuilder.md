The code defines a Scala object and a case class that are used to build client event details for the Who To Follow module of Twitter's product mixer component library. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to serialize and deserialize tracking tokens and controller data for the Who To Follow module, which is used to suggest users for a given Twitter user to follow. 

The `WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder` object defines several utility methods for serializing and deserializing tracking tokens and controller data. It also defines an implicit serializer for converting `ControllerData` objects to and from byte arrays, and a serializer for converting `ControllerData` objects to and from Base64-encoded strings. 

The `WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder` case class extends the `BaseClientEventDetailsBuilder` class, which is used to build client event details for various modules in the product mixer component library. The `WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder` case class takes a `trackingTokenFeature` parameter of type `Feature[_, Option[String]]`, which is used to extract the tracking token from a given `UserCandidate` object. 

The `apply` method of the `WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder` case class takes a `query` parameter of type `Query`, a `candidate` parameter of type `UserCandidate`, and a `candidateFeatures` parameter of type `FeatureMap`. It uses the `trackingTokenFeature` parameter to extract the tracking token from the `candidateFeatures` map, and then uses the `deserializeTrackingToken` and `serializeControllerData` methods of the `WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder` object to deserialize the tracking token and serialize the controller data. It then constructs a `ClientEventDetails` object with the appropriate injection type, controller data, and source data, and returns it as an `Option`. 

Overall, this code provides a way to build client event details for the Who To Follow module of Twitter's product mixer component library, by serializing and deserializing tracking tokens and controller data. It can be used in conjunction with other modules in the product mixer component library to provide personalized recommendations to Twitter users. 

Example usage:

```
val trackingTokenFeature = new Feature[String, Option[String]]("trackingToken", _.trackingToken)

val query = new PipelineQuery()

val candidate = new UserCandidate()

val candidateFeatures = new FeatureMap()

candidateFeatures.put(trackingTokenFeature, Some("trackingToken"))

val builder = WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder(trackingTokenFeature)

val clientEventDetails = builder(query, candidate, candidateFeatures)

println(clientEventDetails)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala object and case class that define a client event details builder for the Who To Follow module of Twitter's product mixer component library pipeline. It serializes and deserializes tracking tokens and controller data for user candidates.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including com.twitter.bijection, com.twitter.hermit.internal.thriftscala, com.twitter.product_mixer, com.twitter.servo.cache, com.twitter.suggests.controller_data.thriftscala, and org.apache.thrift.protocol.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply method in the WhoToFollowClientEventDetailsBuilder case class?
- The apply method takes in a PipelineQuery, a UserCandidate, and a FeatureMap and returns an Option[ClientEventDetails]. The method serializes and deserializes tracking tokens and controller data for the user candidate and returns a ClientEventDetails object with various details about the user candidate.
