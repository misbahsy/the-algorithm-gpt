The `ListVisibilityFilter` class is a filter component that is used to filter out Twitter lists that a viewer is not authorized to have access to. This filter queries the `core.List.strato` column on Strato, which performs an authorization check and only returns lists that the viewer is authorized to access. 

The `ListVisibilityFilter` class takes in a `CoreOnListClientColumn` object as a parameter, which is used to query the `core.List.strato` column. The `apply` method of this class takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]` objects. The `CandidateWithFeatures` object is a wrapper around a `Candidate` object that contains additional features. In this case, the `Candidate` object is a `TwitterListCandidate`, which represents a Twitter list.

The `apply` method first extracts all the `TwitterListCandidate` objects from the `candidates` sequence. It then uses the `Stitch` library to asynchronously fetch the list of allowed list IDs from the `core.List.strato` column. Once the list of allowed list IDs is fetched, the `apply` method filters out the `TwitterListCandidate` objects whose IDs are not in the list of allowed list IDs. The `apply` method returns a `FilterResult` object that contains two sequences of `Candidate` objects: `kept` and `excluded`. The `kept` sequence contains the `TwitterListCandidate` objects whose IDs are in the list of allowed list IDs, while the `excluded` sequence contains the rest of the `Candidate` objects.

This filter component can be used in a larger pipeline to filter out Twitter lists that a viewer is not authorized to access. For example, it can be used in a pipeline that recommends Twitter lists to a viewer based on their interests. The `ListVisibilityFilter` component can be used to ensure that only the recommended lists that the viewer is authorized to access are shown to them. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.filter.list_visibility.ListVisibilityFilter

val listsColumn: CoreOnListClientColumn = ???
val pipelineQuery: PipelineQuery = ???
val candidates: Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[TwitterListCandidate]] = ???

val listVisibilityFilter = new ListVisibilityFilter(listsColumn)
val filterResult = listVisibilityFilter(pipelineQuery, candidates).get
val keptLists: Seq[TwitterListCandidate] = filterResult.kept
val excludedCandidates: Seq[Candidate] = filterResult.excluded
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a filter called `ListVisibilityFilter` that queries a column on Strato and filters out any Twitter lists that the viewer is not authorized to have access to.

2. What input does this code take and what output does it produce?
    
    This code takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[Candidate]` as input, and produces a `FilterResult[Candidate]` as output.

3. What other components or libraries does this code depend on?
    
    This code depends on several other components and libraries, including `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core`, `com.twitter.socialgraph.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.stitch`, and `com.twitter.strato`.
