The code defines a configurable scorer that calls any Deepbird Prediction Service thrift. The scorer takes in a unique identifier, a prediction thrift service, a model selector, query features, candidate features, and result features. The scorer is designed to score candidates based on the query and candidate features passed to the Deepbird model. 

The `DeepbirdV2PredictionServerScorer` class is a case class that takes in five type parameters: `Query`, `Candidate`, `QueryFeatures`, `CandidateFeatures`, and `ResultFeatures`. These parameters define the types of the pipeline query, candidates to score, query level features consumed by the scorer, candidate level features consumed by the scorer, and candidate level features returned by the scorer, respectively. 

The `getBatchPredictions` method takes in a `BatchPredictionRequest` and a `ModelSelector` and returns a `Future` of `BatchPredictionResponse`. This method calls the `batchPredictFromModel` method of the prediction service with the given request and model selector. 

This scorer can be used in the larger project to score candidates based on query and candidate features. The scorer can be configured with different prediction services, model selectors, and feature scopes to suit different use cases. For example, the scorer can be used to score tweets based on user profiles and tweet content. 

Example usage:

```scala
val scorer = DeepbirdV2PredictionServerScorer(
  identifier = ScorerIdentifier("my_scorer"),
  predictionService = myPredictionService,
  modelSelector = myModelSelector,
  queryFeatures = myQueryFeatures,
  candidateFeatures = myCandidateFeatures,
  resultFeatures = myResultFeatures
)

val query = MyQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(MyCandidate(...), MyCandidate(...), ...)
val scores = scorer.score(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a configurable scorer that calls any Deepbird Prediction Service thrift.

2. What are the input and output types of this scorer?
- The input types are Query, Candidate, QueryFeatures, CandidateFeatures, and ResultFeatures, which are all subclasses of BaseDataRecordFeature. The output type is a Set of ResultFeatures.

3. What is the role of the ModelSelector parameter?
- The ModelSelector parameter is used to decide which model to select for scoring. It can be represented as an anonymous function or as a Model ID Selector.
