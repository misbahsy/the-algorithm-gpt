This code defines two cursor models, `UrtOrderedCursor` and `OrderedCursor`, that can be used for cursoring over an ordered candidate source. 

The `UrtOrderedCursor` model extends `UrtPipelineCursor` and takes in four parameters: `initialSortIndex`, `id`, `cursorType`, and `gapBoundaryId`. `initialSortIndex` is a Long that represents the initial sort index, `id` is an optional Long that represents the ID of the element (typically the top element for a top cursor or the bottom element for a bottom cursor) in an ordered candidate list, `cursorType` is an optional `UrtCursorType` that represents the type of cursor being used, and `gapBoundaryId` is an optional Long that represents the ID of the gap boundary element (which is the opposite bound of the gap to be filled with the cursor) in gap cursors. 

The `OrderedCursor` model extends `PipelineCursor` and takes in three parameters: `id`, `cursorType`, and `gapBoundaryId`. `id` is an optional Long that represents the ID of the element in an ordered candidate list, `cursorType` is an optional `CursorType` that represents the type of cursor being used, and `gapBoundaryId` is an optional Long that represents the ID of the gap boundary element in gap cursors. 

These cursor models can be used in the larger project to facilitate cursoring over ordered candidate sources. For example, if the project involves displaying a list of tweets in chronological order, these cursor models can be used to keep track of the user's position in the list and allow them to navigate forward and backward through the list. The `UrtOrderedCursor` model may be used in cases where the cursoring is being done in the context of a URT (Unified Response Time) pipeline, while the `OrderedCursor` model may be used in other contexts. 

Example usage:

```
val cursor = UrtOrderedCursor(0, Some(12345), Some(UrtCursorType.Top))
val nextCursor = cursor.copy(initialSortIndex = 10, id = Some(67890))
```

In this example, a new `UrtOrderedCursor` is created with an initial sort index of 0, an ID of 12345, and a cursor type of Top. The `copy` method is then used to create a new cursor with an initial sort index of 10 and an ID of 67890.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines two cursor models, `UrtOrderedCursor` and `OrderedCursor`, that can be used for cursoring over an ordered candidate source. It is part of the `component_library` module of the larger `product_mixer` project.

2. What is the difference between `UrtOrderedCursor` and `OrderedCursor`?
- `UrtOrderedCursor` extends `UrtPipelineCursor` and uses `UrtCursorType`, while `OrderedCursor` extends `PipelineCursor` and uses `CursorType`. The former is likely specific to a certain use case within the project, while the latter is more general.

3. What is the significance of the `gapBoundaryId` parameter in both cursor models?
- `gapBoundaryId` represents the ID of the gap boundary element, which is used in gap cursors to determine the opposite bound of the gap to be filled with the cursor. It is an optional parameter that may or may not be used depending on the specific cursoring scenario.
