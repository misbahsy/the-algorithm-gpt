The `CrMLRankerModule` class is a module for creating a Thrift client for the `CrMLRanker` service. This module extends the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` class, which provides a convenient way to create a Thrift client using the Finagle Thriftmux protocol. 

The `CrMLRanker` service is a machine learning ranker service that is used to rank items based on various features. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to create a client for this service that can be used to score items. 

The `CrMLRankerModule` class takes two parameters: `totalTimeout` and `batchSize`. `totalTimeout` is the maximum amount of time that the client will wait for a response from the server before timing out. `batchSize` is the maximum number of items that can be scored in a single request. 

The `CrMLRankerModule` class provides a `providesStitchClient` method that creates a `CrMlRankerScoreStitchClient` object. This object is used to score items using the `CrMLRanker` service. The `CrMlRankerScoreStitchClient` takes a `CrMLRanker.MethodPerEndpoint` object as a parameter, which is the Thrift client for the `CrMLRanker` service. The `maxBatchSize` parameter is set to the `batchSize` parameter passed to the `CrMLRankerModule` constructor. 

Overall, this module provides a way to create a client for the `CrMLRanker` service that can be used to score items. The `totalTimeout` and `batchSize` parameters can be adjusted to control the behavior of the client. The `CrMlRankerScoreStitchClient` object created by this module can be used to score items using the `CrMLRanker` service. 

Example usage:

```scala
val crMlRankerModule = CrMLRankerModule(totalTimeout = 200.milliseconds, batchSize = 100)
val injector = Injector(crMlRankerModule)
val crMlRankerClient = injector.instance[CrMlRankerScoreStitchClient]

// Score a single item
val item = Map("feature1" -> 0.5, "feature2" -> 0.3, "feature3" -> 0.2)
val score = crMlRankerClient.scoreItem(item)

// Score multiple items
val items = Seq(
  Map("feature1" -> 0.5, "feature2" -> 0.3, "feature3" -> 0.2),
  Map("feature1" -> 0.2, "feature2" -> 0.3, "feature3" -> 0.5),
  Map("feature1" -> 0.1, "feature2" -> 0.8, "feature3" -> 0.1)
)
val scores = crMlRankerClient.scoreItems(items)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a component library that provides a Thrift client for a machine learning ranker service. It sets up a client for the service and provides a stitch client for scoring.

2. What is the significance of the `totalTimeout` and `batchSize` parameters?
- The `totalTimeout` parameter sets the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a response from the server before timing out. The `batchSize` parameter sets the maximum number of requests that can be sent to the server at once.

3. What is the purpose of the `MtlsClient` trait and how does it relate to the rest of the code?
- The `MtlsClient` trait is used to enable mutual TLS authentication for the Thrift client. It is mixed in with the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` to provide secure communication between the client and server.
