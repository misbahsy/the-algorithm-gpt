The `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` class is a candidate source for the Twitter product mixer. It is responsible for retrieving recommended users from the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` and converting them into `UserCandidate` objects that can be used by the product mixer. 

The `apply` method takes a `GetModuleRequest` object as input and returns a `Stitch` object that wraps a `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object. The `GetModuleRequest` object is used to retrieve a module from the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` using the `getModules` method. The response is then processed to extract the recommended users and their associated features. 

The `layoutToCandidatesWithSourceFeatures` method is used to convert the layout of the module into a `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object. It takes the recommended users, header, display options, and show more options as input and creates a `FeatureMap` object that maps the features to their corresponding values. The `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object is then created using the recommended users and the `FeatureMap`.

The `WhoToFollowModuleHeaderFeature`, `WhoToFollowModuleDisplayOptionsFeature`, and `WhoToFollowModuleShowMoreFeature` objects are features that are used to extract the header, display options, and show more options from the module layout. These features are defined as `Feature` objects that take a `UserCandidate` object as input and return the corresponding feature value.

Overall, the `PeopleDiscoveryCandidateSource` class is an important component of the Twitter product mixer that is responsible for retrieving recommended users from the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` and converting them into `UserCandidate` objects that can be used by the product mixer.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a candidate source component for a people discovery feature. It retrieves user recommendations from a Thrift service and maps them to candidate objects with extracted features.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including Thrift API classes, feature and pipeline classes from the product mixer core, and the Stitch library for making asynchronous calls. These dependencies are used to define the candidate source component and extract features from the retrieved user recommendations.

3. What are the expected inputs and outputs of this code?
- The expected input is a `GetModuleRequest` object from the ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService, which contains parameters for retrieving user recommendations. The output is a `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object, which contains a list of recommended users and their extracted features.
