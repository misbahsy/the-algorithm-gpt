The code defines two classes, `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` and its companion object. The `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class is a selector that inserts each candidate in the `CandidateScope` at the index relative to the original candidate in the `result` at that index using the provided `CandidatePositionInResults` instance. If the current results are shorter length than the computed position, then the candidate will be appended to the results. When the `CandidatePositionInResults` returns a `None`, that candidate is not added to the result. Negative position values are treated as 0 (front of the results).

The `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class extends the `Selector` trait and overrides its `apply` method. The `apply` method takes a `Query` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects as input and returns a `SelectorResult` object. The `apply` method maps each candidate in the `remainingCandidates` sequence to a tuple of its position and the candidate itself. If the candidate is not in the `CandidateScope`, its position is `None`. The method then partitions the tuples into two sequences: one containing the tuples with a non-empty position and the other containing the tuples with an empty position. The method then extracts the candidates from the tuples with a non-empty position and merges them into the `result` sequence using the `DynamicPositionSelector.mergeByIndexIntoResult` method. The method returns a `SelectorResult` object with the `otherRemainingCandidates` sequence and the merged result sequence.

The companion object defines two `apply` methods that create an instance of the `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class. The first method takes a `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` object and a `CandidatePositionInResults` object as input and returns an instance of the `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class. The second method takes a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` objects and a `CandidatePositionInResults` object as input and returns an instance of the `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class.

The `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class is used in the larger project to insert candidates into a result sequence at a dynamic position based on the original position of the candidate in the sequence. The `CandidatePositionInResults` object provides the logic for computing the dynamic position of the candidate. The `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class is used in conjunction with other selectors to create a pipeline of selectors that transform a sequence of candidates into a final result sequence.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class?
- The `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class is a selector that inserts each candidate in the `CandidateScope` at the index relative to the original candidate in the `result` at that index using the provided `CandidatePositionInResults` instance.

2. What is the difference between the two `apply` methods in the `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` object?
- The first `apply` method takes a single `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` while the second `apply` method takes a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`. Both methods take a `CandidatePositionInResults` instance.

3. What is the purpose of the `pipelineScope` parameter in the `InsertPerCandidateDynamicPositionResults` class?
- The `pipelineScope` parameter is a `CandidateScope` that specifies the scope of candidates that can be inserted into the result. Candidates outside of this scope will not be inserted.
