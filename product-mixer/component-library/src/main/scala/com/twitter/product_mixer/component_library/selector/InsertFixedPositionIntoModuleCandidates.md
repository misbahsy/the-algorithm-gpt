The `InsertFixedPositionIntoModuleCandidates` class is a selector that inserts candidates from one pipeline into a specific module of another pipeline at a fixed position. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to modify the contents of a pipeline by inserting candidates from another pipeline into a specific module at a specific position. 

The class takes three parameters: `candidatePipeline`, `targetModuleCandidatePipeline`, and `positionParam`. `candidatePipeline` is the pipeline from which candidates will be inserted, `targetModuleCandidatePipeline` is the pipeline containing the module into which candidates will be inserted, and `positionParam` is the position at which the candidates will be inserted. 

The `apply` method is the main method of the class. It takes a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the results. It returns a `SelectorResult` object containing the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result`.

The method first retrieves the module to update and the items to insert into the module using the `InsertIntoModule` helper class. It then checks if the position is valid and updates the module with the new candidates. If the module does not exist or the items to insert are empty, the method returns the original `remainingCandidates`. Otherwise, it updates the module with the new candidates and returns the updated `remainingCandidates`.

This code can be used in the larger project to modify the contents of a pipeline by inserting candidates from another pipeline into a specific module at a specific position. For example, if a pipeline contains a module for displaying ads and another pipeline contains new ad candidates, this code can be used to insert the new ad candidates into the ad module at a specific position. 

Example usage:

```
val insertSelector = InsertFixedPositionIntoModuleCandidates(
  candidatePipeline = CandidatePipelineIdentifier("newAdsPipeline"),
  targetModuleCandidatePipeline = CandidatePipelineIdentifier("displayAdsPipeline"),
  positionParam = Param(2)
)

val query = PipelineQuery(params = Map(insertSelector.positionParam -> 2))
val remainingCandidates = Seq(...)
val result = Seq(...)

val selectorResult = insertSelector(query, remainingCandidates, result)
val updatedRemainingCandidates = selectorResult.remainingCandidates
val updatedResult = selectorResult.result
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a case class `InsertFixedPositionIntoModuleCandidates` that inserts all candidates from a given `candidatePipeline` at a fixed position into a module from a given `targetModuleCandidatePipeline`. 

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing the current result. It returns a `SelectorResult` object containing the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result`.

3. What is the purpose of the `pipelineScope` variable?
- The `pipelineScope` variable is of type `CandidateScope` and is used to specify the pipelines that this selector applies to. In this case, it specifies that the selector applies to the `candidatePipeline` and `targetModuleCandidatePipeline` pipelines.
