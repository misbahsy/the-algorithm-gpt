The `CallbackMarshaller` class is a part of the functional component of the `product_mixer` core in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. This class is responsible for marshalling the `Callback` object into a `urt.Callback` object. 

The `Callback` object is a model object that contains information about the endpoint of a callback. The `urt.Callback` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same information in a format that can be used by other components of the project.

The `apply` method of the `CallbackMarshaller` class takes a `Callback` object as input and returns a `urt.Callback` object. The `urt.Callback` object is created by setting the `endpoint` field of the `urt.Callback` object to the `endpoint` field of the input `Callback` object.

This class can be used in the larger project to convert `Callback` objects into `urt.Callback` objects. This can be useful when passing information between different components of the project that require the information in the `urt.Callback` format. 

Example usage:

```
val callback = Callback("https://example.com/callback")
val marshaller = CallbackMarshaller()
val urtCallback = marshaller(callback)
// urtCallback.endpoint == "https://example.com/callback"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a callback object used in the response of a product mixer application. It converts the callback object into a thriftscala Callback object.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the Callback class from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata package and the thriftscala Callback class from the com.twitter.timelines.render package.

3. Why is the CallbackMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of the CallbackMarshaller class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected by a dependency injection framework.
