This code defines a sealed trait called `RosettaColor` and several case objects that extend it. Each case object represents a specific color that can be used in the larger project. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized set of colors that can be used throughout the project. By defining a sealed trait and case objects, the project can ensure that only valid colors are used and that they are consistent across different parts of the codebase. 

For example, if a component in the project needs to display text in a specific color, it can use one of the `TextBlackRosettaColor` or `TextBlueRosettaColor` case objects. Similarly, if a button needs to be styled with a specific shade of green, it can use one of the `DeepGreenRosettaColor`, `MediumGreenRosettaColor`, `LightGreenRosettaColor`, `FadedGreenRosettaColor` case objects. 

By using these standardized colors, the project can ensure that the user interface is consistent and visually appealing. Additionally, if the project needs to be rebranded or restyled in the future, it can easily update the colors in one place (this file) and have those changes propagate throughout the codebase. 

Example usage:
```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.color._

val buttonColor = MediumGreenRosettaColor
val textColor = TextBlackRosettaColor
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code defines a sealed trait and multiple case objects representing different colors. A smart developer might want to know how these colors are used in the project and what functionality they provide.
   
2. Are there any naming conventions or patterns being followed for the naming of these case objects?
   - A smart developer might notice that the case objects are named using a combination of color name and "RosettaColor". They might want to know if this naming convention is consistent throughout the project or if it has a specific meaning or purpose.
   
3. Is there any documentation or comments explaining the reasoning behind the selection of these specific colors?
   - A smart developer might want to know if there is any documentation or comments explaining why these specific colors were chosen and if there are any guidelines or standards being followed for color selection in the project.
