This code defines a set of operators that can be used to build predicates for alerts in the larger project. The `Operator` trait is sealed, meaning that all implementations of it must be defined in this file. The six operators defined are `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`, and `=`. These operators can be used to compare values in a predicate, such as checking if a certain metric is greater than a certain threshold.

The purpose of this code is to provide a set of standardized operators that can be used throughout the project to build predicates for alerts. By defining these operators in a sealed trait, it ensures that all operators are defined in a single location and that no other code can define additional operators. This helps to maintain consistency and avoid errors in the code.

Here is an example of how these operators could be used to build a predicate:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert.predicate._

val threshold = 100
val metricValue = 75

val predicate = Predicate(`>`, threshold)

if (predicate.evaluate(metricValue)) {
  println("Alert triggered!")
}
```

In this example, we import the operators defined in this file and then define a threshold value of 100 and a metric value of 75. We then create a `Predicate` using the `>` operator and the threshold value. Finally, we evaluate the predicate using the metric value and print a message if the predicate is true.

Overall, this code provides a useful set of operators that can be used to build predicates for alerts in the larger project. By defining these operators in a sealed trait, it ensures consistency and helps to avoid errors in the code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a sealed trait and case objects for building predicates in the alert component of the product mixer core. It is likely used in conjunction with other code to create and evaluate alerts based on certain conditions.

2. What is the significance of the `private[alert]` modifier?
- The `private[alert]` modifier limits the visibility of the `Operator` trait and case objects to the `alert` package. This means that they can only be accessed within that package and not from outside of it.

3. What is the purpose of the `@see` tag in the code comments?
- The `@see` tag provides a reference to external documentation for the `OPERATOR` predicate, which is likely used in conjunction with the `Operator` trait and case objects. This allows developers to easily access additional information about how to use and implement this code.
