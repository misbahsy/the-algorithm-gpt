The code in this file defines classes and methods related to quality factors for a product mixer pipeline. The `QualityFactorStatus` case class represents the current status of quality factors for a pipeline. It contains a map of `ComponentIdentifier` keys to `QualityFactor` values. The `++` method allows for combining two `QualityFactorStatus` instances, with the values from the second taking precedence over the first in case of conflicts.

The `QualityFactorStatus` object provides a `build` method for creating a new `QualityFactorStatus` instance from a map of `ComponentIdentifier` keys to `QualityFactorConfig` values. The `QualityFactorConfig` instances are used to create the appropriate `QualityFactor` instances based on their type. Currently, the supported types are `LinearLatencyQualityFactorConfig` and `QueriesPerSecondBasedQualityFactorConfig`.

The `HasQualityFactorStatus` trait defines methods for getting the current value of a quality factor for a given `ComponentIdentifier`, as well as the `QualityFactor` instance itself. The `qualityFactorStatus` method returns an `Option[QualityFactorStatus]`, which can be used to check if quality factors are configured for the pipeline. The `withQualityFactorStatus` method allows for setting the `QualityFactorStatus` for a `PipelineQuery`.

Overall, this code provides the infrastructure for managing quality factors for a product mixer pipeline. It allows for creating and combining `QualityFactorStatus` instances, as well as getting the current value of a quality factor for a given component. This functionality is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the product mixer pipeline to determine how to mix different products based on their quality factors. 

Example usage:

```
val qualityFactorConfigs: Map[ComponentIdentifier, QualityFactorConfig] = ...
val qualityFactorStatus = QualityFactorStatus.build(qualityFactorConfigs)

val pipelineQuery = ...
val pipelineQueryWithQualityFactorStatus = pipelineQuery.withQualityFactorStatus(qualityFactorStatus)

val componentIdentifier: ComponentIdentifier = ...
val qualityFactor = pipelineQueryWithQualityFactorStatus.getQualityFactor(componentIdentifier)
val currentValue = pipelineQueryWithQualityFactorStatus.getQualityFactorCurrentValue(componentIdentifier)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `QualityFactorStatus` case class and how is it used in the code?
- The `QualityFactorStatus` case class represents a mapping of `ComponentIdentifier` to `QualityFactor[_]` and is used to store the current quality factor status of a pipeline.
2. What is the `++` method in the `QualityFactorStatus` case class used for?
- The `++` method is used to combine two `QualityFactorStatus` instances into a new instance, with the `QualityFactor[_]` values from the second instance taking precedence over those from the first instance if there are any conflicts.
3. What is the purpose of the `HasQualityFactorStatus` trait and how is it used in the code?
- The `HasQualityFactorStatus` trait defines methods for getting and setting the quality factor status of a pipeline, and is used as a mixin in the `PipelineQuery` class to provide this functionality.
