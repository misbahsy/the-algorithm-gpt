The `ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `ShowAlertInstruction` objects into `urt.ShowAlert` objects. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and displaying alerts to users.

The `ShowAlertInstruction` class contains information about a specific alert that needs to be displayed to a user. This information includes the type of alert, the delay before the alert is triggered, the duration of the alert, the user IDs that the alert should be displayed to, and various other properties.

The `ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller` class takes a `ShowAlertInstruction` object as input and uses various other marshaller classes to convert the properties of the `ShowAlertInstruction` into the corresponding properties of a `urt.ShowAlert` object. For example, the `showAlertTypeMarshaller` is used to convert the `alertType` property of the `ShowAlertInstruction` into the `alertType` property of the `urt.ShowAlert` object.

Once all of the properties have been marshalled, the `ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller` returns a `urt.ShowAlert` object that can be used to display the alert to the user.

Here is an example of how the `ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller` might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val instruction = ShowAlertInstruction(
  showAlert = ShowAlert(
    alertType = "warning",
    triggerDelay = Some(Duration.ofSeconds(5)),
    displayDuration = Some(Duration.ofSeconds(10)),
    userIds = Seq("user1", "user2"),
    colorConfig = ShowAlertColorConfiguration(
      backgroundColor = Some("#FF0000"),
      textColor = Some("#FFFFFF")
    ),
    displayLocation = ShowAlertDisplayLocation(
      position = "top-right",
      offset = Some(10)
    )
  )
)

val marshaller = new ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller(
  new ShowAlertTypeMarshaller(),
  new ClientEventInfoMarshaller(),
  new RichTextMarshaller(),
  new ShowAlertIconDisplayInfoMarshaller(),
  new ShowAlertColorConfigurationMarshaller(),
  new ShowAlertDisplayLocationMarshaller(),
  new ShowAlertNavigationMetadataMarshaller()
)

val alert = marshaller(instruction)
```

In this example, a `ShowAlertInstruction` object is created with some sample properties. The `ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller` is then instantiated with all of the necessary marshaller classes. Finally, the `ShowAlertInstruction` is marshalled into a `urt.ShowAlert` object using the `marshaller` instance. This `urt.ShowAlert` object can then be used to display the alert to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a marshaller for a ShowAlertInstruction object, which is used to display alerts to users. It converts the instruction object into a ShowAlert object that can be rendered by the UI.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they injected?
- This code has dependencies on several marshaller classes and a model class. These dependencies are injected into the constructor of the ShowAlertInstructionMarshaller class using the @Inject annotation.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply() method?
- The apply() method takes a ShowAlertInstruction object as input and returns a urt.ShowAlert object. The method uses the injected marshaller classes to convert the fields of the input object into the corresponding fields of the output object.
