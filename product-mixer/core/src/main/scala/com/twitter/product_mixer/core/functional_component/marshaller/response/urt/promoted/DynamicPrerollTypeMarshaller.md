The `DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling the `DynamicPrerollType` object into a `urt.DynamicPrerollType` object. The `DynamicPrerollType` object is an enumeration that represents the type of dynamic preroll that can be played before a video. The `urt.DynamicPrerollType` object is a Thrift-generated object that is used in the rendering of timelines.

The `DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller` class is a singleton class that is injected into other classes that require this functionality. The `apply` method takes a `DynamicPrerollType` object as input and returns a `urt.DynamicPrerollType` object. The method uses pattern matching to match the input object with one of the three possible values of the `DynamicPrerollType` enumeration. If the input object is `Amplify`, the method returns `urt.DynamicPrerollType.Amplify`. If the input object is `Marketplace`, the method returns `urt.DynamicPrerollType.Marketplace`. If the input object is `LiveTvEvent`, the method returns `urt.DynamicPrerollType.LiveTvEvent`.

This class is used in the larger project to convert the `DynamicPrerollType` object into a Thrift-generated object that can be used in the rendering of timelines. An example of how this class may be used in the larger project is as follows:

```
val dynamicPrerollType: DynamicPrerollType = DynamicPrerollType.Amplify
val dynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller: DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller = DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller()
val urtDynamicPrerollType: urt.DynamicPrerollType = dynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller(dynamicPrerollType)
```

In this example, a `DynamicPrerollType` object is created with the value `Amplify`. An instance of the `DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller` class is then created using the default constructor. The `apply` method of the `DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller` class is then called with the `DynamicPrerollType` object as input. The returned `urt.DynamicPrerollType` object is then assigned to the `urtDynamicPrerollType` variable. This `urt.DynamicPrerollType` object can then be used in the rendering of timelines.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for converting a DynamicPrerollType object into a thriftscala DynamicPrerollType object. It maps three types of DynamicPrerollType (Amplify, Marketplace, and LiveTvEvent) to their corresponding thriftscala types.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on several classes and packages, including Amplify, DynamicPrerollType, LiveTvEvent, Marketplace, and urt.DynamicPrerollType from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.promoted and com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala packages.

3. Why is the DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of the DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class can be injected as a dependency into other classes that require it.
