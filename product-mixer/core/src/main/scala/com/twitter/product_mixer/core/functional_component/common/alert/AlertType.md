The code defines an enumeration of `AlertType` that is used to indicate which metric an alert is for. The `AlertType` is a sealed trait, which means that all its subtypes must be defined in the same file. Each subtype of `AlertType` is an object that extends the trait and has a `metricType` property that is a string representing the type of metric being monitored. 

The `AlertType` enumeration is used in other parts of the project to generate alerts based on the type of metric being monitored. For example, if the `Latency` metric exceeds a certain threshold, an alert will be generated with the `Latency` `AlertType`. 

Adding new `AlertType`s requires updating the dashboard generation code, which suggests that this code is part of a larger system that generates dashboards based on the metrics being monitored. 

Here is an example of how the `AlertType` enumeration can be used:

```scala
val alertType: AlertType = Latency
if (latency > threshold) {
  generateAlert(alertType)
}
```

In this example, if the `latency` metric exceeds the `threshold`, an alert will be generated with the `Latency` `AlertType`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an enumeration of alert types used to monitor different metrics in a product mixer application.

2. What is the significance of the "metricType" property in each case object?
- The "metricType" property is a string value that indicates the specific metric being monitored by each alert type.

3. What is the implication of the note in the documentation about adding new AlertTypes?
- Adding new AlertTypes requires updating the dashboard generation code, which suggests that the alerts are used to generate a dashboard for monitoring the product mixer application.
