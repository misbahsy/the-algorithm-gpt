The `GroupResultsExecutor` class is a specific executor used in the Twitter product mixer project. It takes in a set of candidates with features and decorations, and returns a set of candidates with details. The purpose of this executor is to group the candidates by module presentation and source position, and then sort them by source position. It then creates a set of `ItemCandidateWithDetails` objects for each group of candidates, and wraps them in a `ModuleCandidateWithDetails` object if there is a module presentation associated with the group. Finally, it returns a `GroupResultsExecutorResult` object containing the set of candidates with details.

The `arrow` method is the main method of the class, and takes in a `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`, a `CandidateSourceIdentifier`, and an `Executor.Context` object. It returns an `Arrow` object that maps a `GroupResultsExecutorInput` object to a `GroupResultsExecutorResult` object. The `GroupResultsExecutorInput` object contains the set of candidates with features and decorations. The `GroupResultsExecutorResult` object contains the set of candidates with details.

The `GroupResultsExecutor` class is used in the larger Twitter product mixer project to group and sort candidates by module presentation and source position. It is one of several executors used in the project to process candidates and generate recommendations. Other executors may perform filtering, ranking, or other operations on the candidates. The `GroupResultsExecutor` is a key component of the recommendation engine, as it determines how the candidates are presented to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a `GroupResultsExecutor` class that extends an `Executor` class and provides a method to group and sort candidate results based on their source position and module presentation. It solves the problem of organizing and presenting candidate results in a meaningful way.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `arrow` method?
- The `arrow` method takes in a `GroupResultsExecutorInput` object that contains a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects and a map of `UniversalNoun` objects to `UniversalPresentation` objects. It returns a `GroupResultsExecutorResult` object that contains a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects.

3. What is the purpose of the `wrapWithErrorHandling` method and how does it work?
- The `wrapWithErrorHandling` method is a helper method that takes in an `Executor.Context` object, a `ComponentIdentifier` object, and an `Arrow` object, and returns a new `Arrow` object that wraps the original `Arrow` object with error handling logic. It works by catching any exceptions thrown by the original `Arrow` object and returning an error result instead of propagating the exception.
