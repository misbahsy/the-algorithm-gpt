The `AsyncFeatureMapStep` class is a step in a pipeline that takes an existing asynchronous feature map and executes any hydration needed before the next step. The purpose of this step is to update the query with the updated feature map. 

The class takes two type parameters: `Query` and `State`. `Query` is the type of the pipeline query domain model, and `State` is the pipeline state domain model that has both the query and the asynchronous feature map. 

The class has four methods: `isEmpty`, `adaptInput`, `arrow`, and `updateState`. 

The `isEmpty` method returns false, indicating that the step is not empty. 

The `adaptInput` method takes the current state and the configuration of the step and returns the asynchronous feature map from the state. 

The `arrow` method takes the configuration of the step and the executor context and returns an Arrow that maps the asynchronous feature map to the executor results. 

The `updateState` method takes the current state, the executor results, and the configuration of the step. It gets the hydrated feature map from the executor results and updates the query with the updated feature map. If the hydrated feature map is empty, it returns the current state. Otherwise, it returns the updated state with the updated query. 

The `AsyncFeatureMapStepConfig` case class is the configuration for the `AsyncFeatureMapStep`. It has two fields: `stepToHydrateFor` and `currentStep`. `stepToHydrateFor` is the identifier of the step to hydrate, and `currentStep` is the identifier of the current step. 

Overall, this step is used to update the query with the updated feature map after executing any hydration needed. It is a part of a larger pipeline that processes data and updates the query at each step.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a step in a pipeline for a product mixing service. It takes an existing async feature map and executes any hydration needed before the next step.

2. What are the input and output types for this step?
- The input type is a state object that has a query and an async feature map. The output type is an async feature map executor result.

3. What is the significance of the `Arrow` type and how is it used in this code?
- `Arrow` is a type from the Stitch library that represents a computation that can be executed asynchronously. In this code, it is used to define the computation that the async feature map executor will perform.
