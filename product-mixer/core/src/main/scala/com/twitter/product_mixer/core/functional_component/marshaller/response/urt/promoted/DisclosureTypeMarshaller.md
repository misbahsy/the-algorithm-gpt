The `DisclosureTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for converting a `DisclosureType` object into a `urt.DisclosureType` object. This class is used as a functional component in the larger project to handle the marshalling of response data.

The `DisclosureType` object is imported from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.promoted` package, along with other objects such as `Earned`, `Issue`, `NoDisclosure`, and `Political`. These objects represent different types of disclosures that can be associated with a promoted tweet.

The `DisclosureTypeMarshaller` class is annotated with `@Singleton` and `@Inject`, indicating that it is a dependency that can be injected into other classes. The `apply` method takes a `DisclosureType` object as input and returns a `urt.DisclosureType` object. The `urt` package is imported as `thriftscala` to avoid naming conflicts.

The `apply` method uses pattern matching to determine the type of `DisclosureType` object that was passed in and returns the corresponding `urt.DisclosureType` object. For example, if the input is `NoDisclosure`, the method returns `urt.DisclosureType.NoDisclosure`.

This class can be used in the larger project to handle the marshalling of response data related to promoted tweets. For example, if the project receives a response from the Twitter API that includes information about a promoted tweet, the `DisclosureTypeMarshaller` class can be used to convert the disclosure type of the tweet into a format that can be easily processed by other parts of the project.

Example usage:

```
val disclosureType = NoDisclosure
val marshaller = new DisclosureTypeMarshaller()
val urtDisclosureType = marshaller(disclosureType)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a custom `DisclosureType` object to a corresponding `urt.DisclosureType` object. It is used in the context of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.
   
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including `DisclosureType`, `Earned`, `Issue`, `NoDisclosure`, `Political`, and `urt.DisclosureType`. It also imports several packages and uses annotations for dependency injection.

3. How is this code used in the larger project and what is its significance?
   - This code is likely used as part of a larger system for processing and rendering Twitter timelines. Its significance lies in its ability to convert custom `DisclosureType` objects to a format that can be used by other parts of the system, potentially for display to end users.
