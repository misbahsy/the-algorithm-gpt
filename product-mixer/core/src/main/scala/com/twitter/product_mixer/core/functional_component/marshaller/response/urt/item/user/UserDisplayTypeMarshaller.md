The `UserDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting the `UserDisplayType` enum from the project's model into the corresponding `urt.UserDisplayType` enum from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package. This conversion is necessary because the project's model is different from the `urt` package's model, and the `urt` package is used for rendering timelines.

The `UserDisplayType` enum has three possible values: `User`, `UserDetailed`, and `PendingFollowUser`. The `apply` method in the `UserDisplayTypeMarshaller` class takes a `UserDisplayType` value as input and returns the corresponding `urt.UserDisplayType` value. This method uses pattern matching to determine which `urt.UserDisplayType` value to return based on the input `UserDisplayType` value.

This class is used in the larger project to ensure that the correct `urt.UserDisplayType` value is used when rendering timelines. For example, if a timeline is being rendered for a `UserDetailed` object, the `UserDisplayTypeMarshaller` class will convert the `UserDetailed` value to the corresponding `urt.UserDisplayType` value, which will be used in the rendering process.

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```
val userDisplayType: UserDisplayType = UserDetailed
val userDisplayTypeMarshaller = new UserDisplayTypeMarshaller()
val urtUserDisplayType: urt.UserDisplayType = userDisplayTypeMarshaller(userDisplayType)
// urtUserDisplayType is now equal to urt.UserDisplayType.UserDetailed
```

In this example, the `userDisplayType` variable is set to `UserDetailed`. The `UserDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is then instantiated, and the `apply` method is called with the `userDisplayType` variable as input. The resulting `urt.UserDisplayType` value is then stored in the `urtUserDisplayType` variable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a `UserDisplayType` object to a `urt.UserDisplayType` object. It is used in the Twitter product mixer core functional component for marshalling responses related to user items.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including `PendingFollowUser`, `User`, `UserDetailed`, `UserDisplayType`, and `urt.UserDisplayType`. It also imports classes from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.item.user` and `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` packages.

3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and used throughout the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection, allowing the class to be instantiated and used by other parts of the application.
