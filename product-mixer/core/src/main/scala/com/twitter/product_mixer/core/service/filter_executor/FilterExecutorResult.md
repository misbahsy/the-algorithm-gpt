[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/service/filter_executor/FilterExecutorResult.scala)

The code defines classes and traits related to filtering candidates in a product mixer service. The `FilterExecutorResult` case class is used to represent the result of executing a filter on a sequence of candidates. It contains two fields: `result`, which is a sequence of candidates that passed the filter, and `individualFilterResults`, which is a sequence of `IndividualFilterResults` objects that provide information about the execution of each individual filter.

The `IndividualFilterResults` trait is a sealed trait that defines the possible types of individual filter results. It is used as a base trait for two case classes: `ConditionalFilterDisabled` and `FilterExecutorIndividualResult`. The former is used to represent the case where a filter was disabled due to a condition not being met, and the latter is used to represent the result of executing a filter on a sequence of candidates. It contains three fields: `identifier`, which is the identifier of the filter that was executed, `kept`, which is a sequence of candidates that passed the filter, and `removed`, which is a sequence of candidates that failed the filter.

This code is likely used in the larger product mixer service to filter candidates based on various criteria. The `FilterExecutorResult` class provides a convenient way to represent the results of executing multiple filters on a sequence of candidates, while the `IndividualFilterResults` trait and its subclasses provide detailed information about the execution of each individual filter. This information can be used to debug and optimize the filtering process. 

Example usage:

```
val candidates: Seq[Candidate] = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)
val filter1: Filter[Candidate] = new SomeFilter()
val filter2: Filter[Candidate] = new AnotherFilter()

val filtered1: Seq[Candidate] = filter1.filter(candidates)
val filtered2: Seq[Candidate] = filter2.filter(candidates)

val result: FilterExecutorResult[Candidate] = FilterExecutorResult(
  result = filtered2,
  individualFilterResults = Seq(
    FilterExecutorIndividualResult(
      identifier = filter1.identifier,
      kept = filtered1,
      removed = candidates.diff(filtered1)
    ),
    FilterExecutorIndividualResult(
      identifier = filter2.identifier,
      kept = filtered2,
      removed = candidates.diff(filtered2)
    )
  )
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines case classes and traits related to filtering candidates in a product mixer service. A smart developer might want to know how these classes are used in the larger project and what other components interact with them.

2. What is the difference between `FilterExecutorResult` and `IndividualFilterResults`?
- `FilterExecutorResult` is a case class that contains a sequence of candidates and a sequence of `IndividualFilterResults`. `IndividualFilterResults` is a sealed trait that defines different types of results that can be returned by individual filters. A smart developer might want to know how these two classes are related and how they are used in the filtering process.

3. What is the purpose of the `FilterIdentifier` class and how is it used in this code?
- `FilterIdentifier` is a class that represents a unique identifier for a filter. It is used in `ConditionalFilterDisabled` and `FilterExecutorIndividualResult` to identify the filter that returned the result. A smart developer might want to know how `FilterIdentifier` is instantiated and passed to these classes, and how it is used in the filtering process.
