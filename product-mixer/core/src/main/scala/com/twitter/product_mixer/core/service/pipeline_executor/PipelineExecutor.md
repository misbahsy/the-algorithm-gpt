The `PipelineExecutor` class is responsible for executing a single pipeline of any type. It takes in a `PipelineExecutorRequest` object containing a query and a pipeline identifier, and returns a `PipelineExecutorResult` object containing the result of executing the pipeline on the query. 

The `arrow` method is the main method of the class, which takes in a map of pipelines by their identifiers, a map of quality factor observers by pipeline, and an executor context. It returns an Arrow that takes in a `PipelineExecutorRequest` object and returns a `PipelineExecutorResult` object. 

The method first wraps each pipeline with executor bookkeeping using the `wrapPipelineWithExecutorBookkeeping` method, which adds logging and metrics to the pipeline. It then creates an Arrow that maps the `PipelineExecutorRequest` object to a tuple of the pipeline and the query, using the pipeline identifier to look up the pipeline in the map of wrapped pipelines. If the pipeline is not found, it throws a `PipelineFailure` with an `InvalidPipelineSelected` error. 

Finally, the method applies the pipeline Arrow to the tuple, and wraps the result in a `PipelineExecutorResult` object. The method does not handle any additional error cases, as the component stack is already populated with the missing pipeline in case of an error. 

This class is used in the larger project to execute pipelines on queries, and can be used in conjunction with other classes such as the `PipelineSelectorExecutor` to select the appropriate pipeline to execute based on the query. 

Example usage:
```
val pipelineExecutor = new PipelineExecutor(statsReceiver)
val pipeline = Pipeline(query => query.toString, ComponentIdentifier("test"))
val pipelineByIdentifier = Map(pipeline.identifier -> pipeline)
val qualityFactorObserverByPipeline = Map(pipeline.identifier -> new QualityFactorObserver())
val context = new Executor.Context(new ComponentStack())
val arrow = pipelineExecutor.arrow(pipelineByIdentifier, qualityFactorObserverByPipeline, context)
val result = arrow.apply(PipelineExecutorRequest("hello", pipeline.identifier))
println(result) // prints PipelineExecutorResult(hello)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a PipelineExecutor class that executes a single pipeline and returns a PipelineExecutorResult.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.ComponentIdentifier, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.Pipeline, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.quality_factor.QualityFactorObserver, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.service.Executor, com.twitter.stitch.Arrow, javax.inject.Inject, and javax.inject.Singleton.

3. What is the future plan for this code?
- The code currently does not support fail open/closed policies like CandidatePipelineExecutor does, but in the future, they may be merged.
