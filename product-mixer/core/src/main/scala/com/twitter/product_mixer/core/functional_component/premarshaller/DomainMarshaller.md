This code defines a trait and several exception classes related to domain marshalling in the context of the larger project called "The Algorithm from Twitter". 

Domain marshalling is the process of transforming data from one representation to another within a specific domain or business context. In this project, the `DomainMarshaller` trait is used to transform `selections` into a `DomainResponseType` object, which is often a URT (User Response Type), Slice, or other domain-specific type. 

The `DomainMarshaller` trait is defined with a type parameter `Query` that must be a subtype of `PipelineQuery`, and a type parameter `DomainResponseType` that represents the output type of the marshalling process. The trait also extends the `Component` trait, which is a common trait for all components in the project. 

The `apply` method defined in the `DomainMarshaller` trait takes a `Query` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects as input, and returns a `DomainResponseType` object. The `CandidateWithDetails` object represents a candidate that has been selected for inclusion in the output. 

The exception classes defined in this file are used to handle various error conditions that may occur during the domain marshalling process. For example, the `UnsupportedCandidateDomainMarshallerException` is thrown when a candidate is encountered that is not supported by the domain marshaller. The `UndecoratedCandidateDomainMarshallerException` is thrown when an undecorated candidate is encountered, meaning a candidate that has not been decorated with additional information. 

Overall, this code provides a foundation for domain marshalling in the larger project, allowing for the transformation of data within a specific business context.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a trait called `DomainMarshaller` which transforms selections into a domain-specific response type. It is part of the functional component premarshaller package in the larger product mixer core project.

2. What is the relationship between `DomainMarshaller` and `TransportMarshaller`?
- `DomainMarshaller` is different from `TransportMarshaller` in that it transforms selections into a domain-specific response type, while `TransportMarshaller` transforms into a wire-compatible type.

3. What are the exceptions defined in this code and when might they be thrown?
- The exceptions defined in this code are `UnsupportedCandidateDomainMarshallerException`, `UndecoratedCandidateDomainMarshallerException`, `UnsupportedPresentationDomainMarshallerException`, `UnsupportedModuleDomainMarshallerException`, and `UndecoratedModuleDomainMarshallerException`. They might be thrown when a domain marshaller does not support a certain type of candidate, presentation, or module.
