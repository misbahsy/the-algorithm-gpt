The `DebugTwitterContext` trait is designed to provide support for debugging purposes by allowing the forging of UserIds in `TwitterContext`. This trait is used in conjunction with a thrift controller, which can extend `DebugTwitterContext` and wrap its execution logic. 

The `withDebugTwitterContext` method is the main method of this trait. It takes a `ClientContext` object as input and a function `f` to wrap. The `ClientContext` object is a product mixer request client context. The `withDebugTwitterContext` method generates a fake Twitter context for debug usage by calling the `forgeTwitterContext` method. It then wraps the function `f` with the generated context using the `ctx.let` method. 

The `forgeTwitterContext` method generates a fake Twitter context for debug usage. It creates a `Viewer` object with the `userId` parameter passed to it. The `Viewer` object is a Thrift struct that represents the authenticated user of a request. It contains information such as the user's ID, IP address, and user agent. 

Overall, this trait is useful for debugging purposes when testing a thrift controller. It allows developers to generate a fake Twitter context with hardcoded UserIds for testing purposes. 

Example usage:

```
class MyThriftController extends SomeThriftController with DebugTwitterContext {
  def myEndpoint(request: MyRequest): Future[MyResponse] = {
    withDebugTwitterContext(request.clientContext) {
      // execute some logic
    }
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the DebugTwitterContext trait?
    
    The DebugTwitterContext trait is used to add support for forging UserIds in TwitterContext for debug purposes.

2. How is the withDebugTwitterContext method used?
    
    The withDebugTwitterContext method takes a ClientContext and a function as input and returns the result of the function. It wraps the function in a debug TwitterContext with hardcoded userIds to the ClientContext.userId.

3. What is the purpose of the forgeTwitterContext method?
    
    The forgeTwitterContext method generates a fake Twitter Context for debug usage. It creates a Viewer object with the given userId and other optional parameters set to None or empty sets.
