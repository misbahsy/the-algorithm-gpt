This code defines a sealed trait called `PageHeader` and a case class called `TopicPageHeader` that extends the `PageHeader` trait. The purpose of this code is to provide a model for representing the header of a topic page in the context of the larger project, which likely involves displaying topic pages to users.

The `TopicPageHeader` case class has several fields, including `topicId`, which is a string representing the ID of the topic being displayed, and `facepile`, which is an optional `TopicPageHeaderFacepile` object. The `clientEventInfo` field is also optional and represents metadata about the client event associated with the topic page. The `landingContext` field is another optional string that represents the context in which the user landed on the topic page. Finally, the `displayType` field is an optional `TopicPageHeaderDisplayType` object that represents the type of display used for the topic page header.

The `TopicPageHeader` case class also extends the `HasClientEventInfo` trait, which likely provides additional functionality related to client event metadata.

This code can be used in the larger project to represent the header of a topic page and provide metadata about the client event associated with the page. For example, the `TopicPageHeader` object could be created and passed to a view layer to be rendered as part of the topic page. The `clientEventInfo` field could also be used to track user interactions with the topic page and provide analytics data to the project team. Overall, this code provides a useful model for representing topic page headers and associated metadata in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PageHeader` trait and how is it used in the code?
   - The `PageHeader` trait is a sealed trait that is used as a base trait for different types of page headers. It is used to define a common interface for all page headers.
2. What is the significance of the `HasClientEventInfo` trait and how is it related to the `PageHeader` trait?
   - The `HasClientEventInfo` trait is a marker trait that indicates that a class has a `clientEventInfo` field of type `Option[ClientEventInfo]`. It is related to the `PageHeader` trait because some implementations of `PageHeader` may have a `clientEventInfo` field.
3. What is the purpose of the `TopicPageHeaderDisplayType` enumeration and how is it used in the code?
   - The `TopicPageHeaderDisplayType` enumeration is used to represent different display types for a topic page header. It is used in the `TopicPageHeader` case class to set the default value of the `displayType` field to `BasicTopicPageHeaderDisplayType` if no value is provided.
