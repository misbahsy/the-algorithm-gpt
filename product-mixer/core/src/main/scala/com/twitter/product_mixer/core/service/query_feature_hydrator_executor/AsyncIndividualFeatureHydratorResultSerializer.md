This code defines a custom JSON serializer for a specific class called `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult`. The purpose of this serializer is to skip over any values in the `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` object that are of type `Stitch`. 

The `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` class is likely a part of a larger project that involves querying and hydrating features for some sort of product mixer. The purpose of this specific serializer is to ensure that when the `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` object is serialized to JSON, any `Stitch` values are skipped over. 

The serializer extends the `JsonSerializer` class from the Jackson library and overrides the `serialize` method. Within this method, the `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` object is transformed into a `Map` where the keys are the `hydrateBefore` values from the original object and the values are the `toString` representations of the `features` in the original object. This `Map` is then serialized using the `defaultSerializeValue` method from the `SerializerProvider` class. 

Overall, this code is a small but important part of a larger project that involves querying and hydrating features for a product mixer. By skipping over `Stitch` values during serialization, this code ensures that the resulting JSON is clean and only contains the relevant feature data. 

Example usage:

```scala
val result = AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult(hydrateBefore = "someValue", features = Seq(Feature1, Stitch, Feature2))
val serializer = new AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResultSerializer()
val json = mapper.writeValueAsString(result)(serializer)
println(json)
// Output: {"someValue":["Feature1","Feature2"]}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a custom JSON serializer for a specific class called `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult`, which skips certain values.

2. What is the significance of the `private[query_feature_hydrator_executor]` modifier?
- This modifier limits the visibility of the `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResultSerializer` class to only the package `query_feature_hydrator_executor`.

3. What does the `serialize` method do?
- The `serialize` method takes an instance of `AsyncIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` and writes its data to a JSON generator, skipping certain values.
