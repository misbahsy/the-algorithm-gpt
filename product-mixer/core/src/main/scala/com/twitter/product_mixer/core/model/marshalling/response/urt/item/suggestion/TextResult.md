The `TextResult` class represents text with hit-highlights used for returning search query suggestions in the context of the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is located in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.item.suggestion` package. 

The `TextResult` class has four fields: `text`, `hitHighlights`, `score`, and `querySource`. The `text` field is a string that represents the text that is being highlighted. The `hitHighlights` field is an optional sequence of `HighlightedSection` objects that represent the sections of the text that should be highlighted. The `score` field is an optional double that represents the score of the text result. The `querySource` field is an optional string that represents the source of the query.

This class is used to represent the results of a search query in the larger project. The `hitHighlights` field is particularly useful for displaying the search results to the user in a way that highlights the relevant sections of the text. The `score` field can be used to rank the search results based on relevance. The `querySource` field can be used to track the source of the query, which can be useful for analytics purposes.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val searchQuery = "Twitter algorithm"
val searchResults = performSearch(searchQuery)
val textResults = searchResults.map(result => TextResult(result.text, result.highlights, result.score, "user"))
displayResults(textResults)
```

In this example, `performSearch` is a function that takes a search query and returns a sequence of search results. The `map` function is used to convert each search result into a `TextResult` object. The `querySource` field is set to "user" to indicate that the query was initiated by a user. The `displayResults` function is used to display the search results to the user, with the relevant sections of the text highlighted.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the TextResult class and how is it used in the project?
- The TextResult class represents text with hit-highlights used for returning search query suggestions. It is used in the project for handling search query responses.

2. What is the significance of the hitHighlights field and how is it populated?
- The hitHighlights field is an optional sequence of HighlightedSection objects that represent the sections of the text that match the search query. It is populated based on the search query results.

3. How is the score field calculated and what is its relevance to the project?
- The score field is an optional Double value that represents the relevance score of the search query result. Its calculation is not specified in the code and may depend on the specific search algorithm used in the project. Its relevance to the project is in determining the order and ranking of search query results.
