The code defines a case class called `FilterResult` that is used to represent the result of applying a filter to a sequence of candidates. The `FilterResult` contains two sequences: `kept` and `removed`, which respectively represent the candidates that passed and failed the filter. 

This code is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing large amounts of data. The `FilterResult` class is likely used in conjunction with other functional components to filter and process data. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val candidates: Seq[Candidate] = // some sequence of candidates
val filter: Filter[Candidate] = // some filter to apply to the candidates

val filterResult: FilterResult[Candidate] = filter.apply(candidates)
val keptCandidates: Seq[Candidate] = filterResult.kept
val removedCandidates: Seq[Candidate] = filterResult.removed

// do something with the kept and removed candidates
```

In this example, we have a sequence of `Candidate` objects and a `Filter` object that we want to apply to the candidates. We call the `apply` method on the `Filter` object, passing in the sequence of candidates. This returns a `FilterResult` object that contains the candidates that passed and failed the filter. We can then access these sequences using the `kept` and `removed` properties of the `FilterResult` object and do something with them. 

Overall, the `FilterResult` class is a useful tool for processing large amounts of data and filtering out unwanted candidates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Filter` class that is mentioned in the code?
   - The code mentions a `Filter` class, but it is not defined in this file. A smart developer might wonder what the purpose of this class is and how it relates to the `FilterResult` case class.
   
2. What is the significance of the `+` symbol before the `Candidate` type parameter in the `FilterResult` case class?
   - The `+` symbol indicates that the `Candidate` type parameter is covariant. A smart developer might want to know why this is important and how it affects the usage of the `FilterResult` class.

3. How is the `FilterResult` class used in the larger context of the project?
   - The code only defines the `FilterResult` case class, but it doesn't show how it is used in the rest of the project. A smart developer might want to know where and how this class is used, and what other components it interacts with.
