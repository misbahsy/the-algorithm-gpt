The `AdMetadataContainerMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling an `AdMetadataContainer` object into a `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and displaying advertisements.

The `AdMetadataContainer` object contains metadata about an advertisement, such as the sponsorship organization and type, as well as data related to Apple's SKAdNetwork framework. The `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same data in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized.

The `apply` method takes an `AdMetadataContainer` object as input and returns a `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object. The method maps the fields of the input object to the corresponding fields of the output object. Some fields require additional processing, such as mapping the `sponsorshipType` and `disclaimerType` fields using the `SponsorshipTypeMarshaller` and `DisclaimerTypeMarshaller` classes, respectively.

This class is likely used in the larger project to convert `AdMetadataContainer` objects into a format that can be easily transmitted and stored. For example, the `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object may be serialized and sent over a network to be stored in a database or displayed to a user.

Example usage:

```
val adMetadataContainer = AdMetadataContainer(
  removePromotedAttributionForPreroll = true,
  sponsorshipCandidate = "Acme Corp",
  sponsorshipOrganization = "Acme Corp",
  sponsorshipOrganizationWebsite = "https://acme.com",
  sponsorshipType = Some(SponsorshipType.PROMOTED),
  disclaimerType = Some(DisclaimerType.SPONSORED),
  skAdNetworkDataList = Some(Seq(SkAdNetworkData(
    version = 2,
    network = "abcd1234.defg5678",
    campaign = "123456",
    itunesItem = "987654321"
  ))),
  unifiedCardOverride = None
)

val marshaller = new AdMetadataContainerMarshaller(
  new SponsorshipTypeMarshaller(),
  new DisclaimerTypeMarshaller(),
  new SkAdNetworkDataMarshaller()
)

val urtAdMetadataContainer = marshaller(adMetadataContainer)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that marshals an `AdMetadataContainer` object into a `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object. It uses several other marshaller classes to convert the fields of the input object into the appropriate format for the output object.
   
2. What are the dependencies of this class?
   - This class depends on three other marshaller classes: `SponsorshipTypeMarshaller`, `DisclaimerTypeMarshaller`, and `SkAdNetworkDataMarshaller`. These classes are injected into the constructor of `AdMetadataContainerMarshaller`.
   
3. What is the scope of this class?
   - This class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of it will be created and shared across the application. This suggests that it is intended to be used as a shared utility class rather than a class that is instantiated multiple times.
