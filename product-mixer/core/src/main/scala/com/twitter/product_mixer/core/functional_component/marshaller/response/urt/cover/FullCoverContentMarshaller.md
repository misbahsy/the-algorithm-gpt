The `FullCoverContentMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `FullCoverContent` object into a `urt.Cover` object, which is used in the larger project to display cover images on Twitter timelines. The `FullCoverContent` object contains information about the cover image, such as the display type, primary and secondary text, image variant, and details. 

The `apply` method takes a `FullCoverContent` object as input and returns a `urt.Cover` object. It uses various marshaller classes, such as `FullCoverDisplayTypeMarshaller` and `RichTextMarshaller`, to convert the different fields of the `FullCoverContent` object into the appropriate format for the `urt.Cover` object. For example, the `primaryText` field of the `FullCoverContent` object is converted into a `richTextMarshaller` object before being assigned to the `primaryText` field of the `urt.FullCover` object.

The `urt.Cover` object is part of the `com.twitter.timelines.render` package and is used to display cover images on Twitter timelines. The `FullCoverContentMarshaller` class is a singleton and is injected with various marshaller classes as dependencies. This allows for easy testing and maintenance of the code.

Example usage:

```
val fullCoverContent = FullCoverContent(
  displayType = FullCoverDisplayType.Large,
  primaryText = "Check out our new product!",
  primaryCoverCta = CoverCta("Learn More", "https://example.com"),
  secondaryCoverCta = Some(CoverCta("Buy Now", "https://example.com/buy")),
  secondaryText = Some("Limited time offer!"),
  imageVariant = Some(ImageVariant("https://example.com/image.jpg", 1200, 600)),
  details = Some("Product details here"),
  dismissInfo = Some(DismissInfo("Dismiss", "https://example.com/dismiss")),
  imageDisplayType = Some(ImageDisplayType.FullWidth),
  impressionCallbacks = Some(List(Callback("https://example.com/impression")))
)

val fullCoverContentMarshaller = new FullCoverContentMarshaller(
  new FullCoverDisplayTypeMarshaller(),
  new CoverCtaMarshaller(),
  new RichTextMarshaller(),
  new ImageVariantMarshaller(),
  new DismissInfoMarshaller(),
  new ImageDisplayTypeMarshaller(),
  new CallbackMarshaller()
)

val urtCover = fullCoverContentMarshaller(fullCoverContent)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that marshals a FullCoverContent object into a thriftscala Cover object. It uses various other marshaller classes to convert the fields of the FullCoverContent object into the appropriate fields of the Cover object.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other marshaller classes, including FullCoverDisplayTypeMarshaller, CoverCtaMarshaller, RichTextMarshaller, ImageVariantMarshaller, DismissInfoMarshaller, ImageDisplayTypeMarshaller, and CallbackMarshaller. It also imports classes from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.cover and com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala packages.

3. What is the scope of the FullCoverContentMarshaller class?
- The FullCoverContentMarshaller class is annotated with @Singleton, indicating that it is intended to be a singleton object that can be injected into other classes. It takes several other marshaller classes as constructor arguments and has a single apply method that takes a FullCoverContent object and returns a thriftscala Cover object.
