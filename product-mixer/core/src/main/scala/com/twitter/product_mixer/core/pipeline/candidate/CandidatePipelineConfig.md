This code defines a set of traits and classes that can be used to configure a candidate pipeline in the Product Mixer system at Twitter. A candidate pipeline is a pipeline that fetches candidates for a given query. The pipeline consists of a series of steps that are executed in order, and each step can be customized using the provided traits and classes.

The `BaseCandidatePipelineConfig` trait defines the basic configuration for a candidate pipeline. It is parameterized by the types of the query, candidate source query, candidate source result, and result. It extends the `PipelineConfig` trait, which is a marker trait for all pipeline configurations. The `BaseCandidatePipelineConfig` trait defines several abstract methods and values that must be implemented by concrete pipeline configurations. These include the pipeline identifier, the candidate source, the query transformer, the result transformer, the filters, the scorers, and the alerts.

The `CandidatePipelineConfig` trait extends the `BaseCandidatePipelineConfig` trait and provides a default implementation for the `gates` value. The `DependentCandidatePipelineConfig` trait also extends the `BaseCandidatePipelineConfig` trait but is intended for use in pipelines that depend on other pipelines.

The `CandidatePipelineConfigCompanion` object defines a set of pipeline steps that are available for all candidate pipelines. These steps include gates, feature hydration, candidate source, filters, scorers, decorator, and result. The `stepsInOrder` value defines the order in which these steps are executed, and the `stepsAsyncFeatureHydrationCanBeCompletedBy` value defines the set of steps that can be completed asynchronously.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible framework for configuring candidate pipelines in the Product Mixer system at Twitter. By implementing the various traits and classes provided, developers can customize the behavior of each step in the pipeline and create pipelines that are tailored to their specific use cases.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a set of traits and classes for building candidate pipelines in the Product Mixer framework used by Twitter. It includes components for fetching and transforming candidate data, applying filters and scoring, and adding alerts and decorators.

2. What are the different components that can be included in a candidate pipeline and how do they work together?
- The components include candidate sources, feature hydrators, filters, decorators, and scorers, which are applied sequentially to transform and score candidate data. Gates can be used to control whether the pipeline runs, and alerts can be added to monitor performance.

3. How can a developer customize a candidate pipeline for their specific use case?
- Developers can extend the BaseCandidatePipelineConfig trait and override the various methods to provide their own implementations for components like candidate sources, filters, and transformers. They can also define their own feature hydrators and scorers to extract and score candidate features.
