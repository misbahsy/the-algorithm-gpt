[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/service/gate_executor/StoppedGateException.scala)

The code defines a Scala case class called `StoppedGateException` that extends the `Exception` class and implements the `NoStackTrace` trait. This exception is thrown when a closed gate stops the execution of a pipeline. The `toString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the exception that includes the identifier of the gate that caused the exception.

The code also defines a companion object for the `StoppedGateException` class that provides a method called `classifier`. This method creates a `PipelineFailureClassifier` that is used to classify failures in a pipeline. The `PipelineFailureClassifier` is a function that takes an exception as input and returns a `PipelineFailure` object. The `classifier` method takes a `PipelineFailureCategory` as input and returns a `PipelineFailureClassifier` that maps `StoppedGateException` to a `PipelineFailure` object with the provided category. The `PipelineFailure` object includes the message of the `StoppedGateException` and the exception itself as an optional parameter.

This code is likely used in the larger project to handle pipeline failures caused by closed gates. The `StoppedGateException` is thrown when a gate is closed and stops the execution of a pipeline. The `classifier` method provides a way to classify these failures and handle them appropriately. For example, the `PipelineFailureCategory` could be used to determine how to retry the pipeline or notify the appropriate team of the failure. 

Example usage:

```scala
val stoppedGateException = StoppedGateException(GateIdentifier("gate1"))
val classifier = StoppedGateException.classifier(PipelineFailureCategory("gate_failure"))
val pipelineFailure = classifier(stoppedGateException)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StoppedGateException` class?
- The `StoppedGateException` class is used to signal that the execution of a pipeline has been stopped due to a closed gate.

2. What is the `classifier` method in the `StoppedGateException` object used for?
- The `classifier` method creates a `PipelineFailureClassifier` that maps `StoppedGateException` to a `PipelineFailure` with the provided `PipelineFailureCategory`. This is used for classifying failures in a pipeline.

3. What is the purpose of the `NoStackTrace` trait in the `StoppedGateException` class?
- The `NoStackTrace` trait is used to suppress the stack trace of the exception when it is thrown, as it is not needed in this case.
