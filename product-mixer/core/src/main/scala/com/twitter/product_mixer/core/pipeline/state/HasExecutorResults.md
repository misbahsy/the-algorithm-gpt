[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/pipeline/state/HasExecutorResults.scala)

The code defines a trait called `HasExecutorResults` that is used to maintain a list of `ExecutorResult` objects for each `PipelineStepIdentifier`. The `PipelineStepIdentifier` is a unique identifier for each step in a pipeline. The `ExecutorResult` is a result object that is returned by the executor service after executing a step in the pipeline.

The trait has a `ListMap` object called `executorResultsByPipelineStep` that is used to store the `ExecutorResult` objects for each `PipelineStepIdentifier`. The `ListMap` is used to maintain the insertion order of the `ExecutorResult` objects.

The trait also has a private method called `setExecutorResults` that is used to set the `executorResultsByPipelineStep` object with a new `ListMap` object. This method is only accessible within the `pipeline` package.

This trait can be used in the larger project to maintain the results of each step in a pipeline. For example, if the project has a pipeline that processes data in multiple steps, each step can return an `ExecutorResult` object that contains information about the execution of that step. The `HasExecutorResults` trait can be used to store these `ExecutorResult` objects for each step in the pipeline. This can be useful for debugging and monitoring the pipeline.

Here is an example of how this trait can be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.PipelineStepIdentifier
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.service.ExecutorResult
import scala.collection.immutable.ListMap

class MyPipelineState extends HasExecutorResults[MyPipelineState] {
  var executorResultsByPipelineStep: ListMap[PipelineStepIdentifier, ExecutorResult] = ListMap.empty

  def setExecutorResults(
    newMap: ListMap[PipelineStepIdentifier, ExecutorResult]
  ): MyPipelineState = {
    val newState = new MyPipelineState()
    newState.executorResultsByPipelineStep = newMap
    newState
  }
}

val state = new MyPipelineState()
val step1Id = PipelineStepIdentifier("step1")
val step2Id = PipelineStepIdentifier("step2")
val result1 = ExecutorResult("step1 completed successfully")
val result2 = ExecutorResult("step2 completed successfully")
val resultMap = ListMap(step1Id -> result1, step2Id -> result2)
val newState = state.setExecutorResults(resultMap)
``` 

In this example, we create a new `MyPipelineState` object that extends the `HasExecutorResults` trait. We then create two `PipelineStepIdentifier` objects for two steps in the pipeline. We also create two `ExecutorResult` objects for these steps. We then create a `ListMap` object that maps the `PipelineStepIdentifier` objects to the `ExecutorResult` objects. We use the `setExecutorResults` method to set the `executorResultsByPipelineStep` object with the new `ListMap` object. Finally, we create a new state object with the updated `executorResultsByPipelineStep` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HasExecutorResults` trait?
- The `HasExecutorResults` trait defines a contract for a state object to have a `ListMap` of `ExecutorResult` objects associated with `PipelineStepIdentifier`s.

2. What is the significance of using a `ListMap` instead of a regular `Map`?
- The use of a `ListMap` ensures that the order of insertion is maintained, which may be important for maintaining the order of pipeline steps.

3. What is the purpose of the `setExecutorResults` method and why is it marked as `private[pipeline]`?
- The `setExecutorResults` method is used to set the `executorResultsByPipelineStep` field to a new `ListMap`. It is marked as `private[pipeline]` to limit its visibility to within the `pipeline` package.
