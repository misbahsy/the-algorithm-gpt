The code defines a mixin trait called `Conditionally` that can be added to a `Component` that's marked with `SupportsConditionally`. A `Component` with `SupportsConditionally` and `Conditionally` will only be run when `onlyIf` returns true. If `onlyIf` returns false, the `Component` is skipped and no stats are recorded for it. 

The `Conditionally` trait takes a type parameter `Input` that is used to gate a component on or off. It defines a method `onlyIf` that takes an `Input` parameter and returns a boolean. If `onlyIf` returns true, the underlying `Component` is run, otherwise, it's skipped. It's important to note that `onlyIf` should never throw an exception because if it does, the `Component`'s stats will not be incremented. 

The `SupportsConditionally` trait is a marker trait added to the base type for each `Component` that supports the `Conditionally` mixin. It's `private[core]` because it can only be added to the base implementation of components by the Product Mixer team. 

The `Conditionally` object defines a helper method called `and` that combines the `Conditionally.onlyIf` of an underlying `Component` with an additional predicate. It takes three parameters: `query`, `component`, and `onlyIf`. `query` is the input that is used to gate a component on or off if `Conditionally` is mixed in. `component` is the `Component` with `SupportsConditionally` and `Conditionally`. `onlyIf` is a boolean that determines whether the `Component` should be run or not. 

Overall, this code provides a way to conditionally run a `Component` based on a given input. It's useful in the larger project because it allows for more fine-grained control over which components are run based on certain conditions. Here's an example of how this code might be used:

```scala
class MyComponent extends Component with SupportsConditionally[String] with Conditionally[String] {
  def process(input: String): String = {
    // do some processing
  }

  def onlyIf(query: String): Boolean = {
    query.startsWith("foo")
  }
}

val myComponent = new MyComponent()
val input = "foobar"
val shouldRun = Conditionally.and(input, myComponent, true)
if (shouldRun) {
  myComponent.process(input)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Conditionally` trait and how is it used?
- The `Conditionally` trait is a mixin trait that can be added to a `Component` to conditionally run it based on a query input. It provides a helper method `and` to combine the `onlyIf` method of the underlying `Component` with an additional predicate.

2. What is the significance of the `SupportsConditionally` trait and why is it marked as private?
- The `SupportsConditionally` trait is a marker trait added to the base type for each `Component` which supports the `Conditionally` mixin. It is marked as private because it can only be added to the base implementation of components by the Product Mixer team.

3. What happens if an exception is thrown when evaluating the `onlyIf` method of a `Conditionally` trait?
- If an exception is thrown when evaluating the `onlyIf` method of a `Conditionally` trait, it will bubble up to the containing `Pipeline`, however the `Component`'s stats will not be incremented. Because of this, `onlyIf` should never throw.
