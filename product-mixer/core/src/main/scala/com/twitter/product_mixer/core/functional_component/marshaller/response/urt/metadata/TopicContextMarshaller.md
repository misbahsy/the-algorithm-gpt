The `TopicContextMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling a `TopicContext` object into a `urt.SocialContext` object. 

The `TopicContext` object contains information about a topic, such as its ID and functionality type. The `urt.SocialContext` object is a Thrift object that is used to represent social context information in Twitter timelines. 

The `apply` method in the `TopicContextMarshaller` class takes a `TopicContext` object as input and returns a `urt.SocialContext` object. It does this by creating a new `urt.TopicContext` object and setting its properties to the corresponding properties of the input `TopicContext` object. The `functionalityType` property is marshalled using the `TopicContextFunctionalityTypeMarshaller` class, which converts a `BasicTopicContextFunctionalityType` object into a Thrift object. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert `TopicContext` objects into Thrift objects that can be used in Twitter timelines. An example usage of this class might look like:

```
val topicContext = TopicContext(topicId = "12345", functionalityType = Some(BasicTopicContextFunctionalityType.SPORTS))
val topicContextMarshaller = TopicContextMarshaller()
val socialContext = topicContextMarshaller(topicContext)
```

In this example, a new `TopicContext` object is created with an ID of "12345" and a functionality type of "SPORTS". The `TopicContextMarshaller` is then used to convert this object into a `urt.SocialContext` object, which can be used in a Twitter timeline.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a `TopicContext` object into a `urt.SocialContext` object. It is used in the context of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including `BasicTopicContextFunctionalityType`, `TopicContext`, and `TopicContextFunctionalityTypeMarshaller` from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata` package, as well as `urt.SocialContext` and `urt.TopicContext` from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package.
3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection, allowing the class to be instantiated and used by other parts of the application.
