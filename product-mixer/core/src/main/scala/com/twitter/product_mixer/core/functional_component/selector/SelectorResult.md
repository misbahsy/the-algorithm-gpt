This code defines a case class called `SelectorResult` that is used as the result of a `Selector` operation in the larger project. The purpose of the `Selector` is to select a subset of items from a larger set of candidates based on certain criteria. 

The `SelectorResult` contains two fields: `remainingCandidates` and `result`. `remainingCandidates` is a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects that were not selected by the `Selector`. `result` is a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects that were selected by the `Selector`.

This case class is used to encapsulate the results of a `Selector` operation and make it easier to pass around the selected and remaining candidates to other parts of the project. 

Here is an example of how this case class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val candidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails] = // some sequence of candidates
val selector: Selector = // some Selector object
val selectorResult: SelectorResult = selector.select(candidates)

// use the selected candidates
val selectedCandidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails] = selectorResult.result

// use the remaining candidates
val remainingCandidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails] = selectorResult.remainingCandidates
```

In this example, we first define a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects. We then create a `Selector` object and use it to select a subset of the candidates. The result of the `select` method is a `SelectorResult` object that contains the selected and remaining candidates. We can then use these sequences as needed in the rest of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Selector class that this SelectorResult is associated with?
- The code does not provide information on the Selector class and its purpose.

2. What is the data type of the objects in the Seq[CandidateWithDetails]?
- The objects in the Seq[CandidateWithDetails] are of type CandidateWithDetails, but the code does not provide information on the structure and properties of this data type.

3. Can the SelectorResult be modified after it is created?
- The SelectorResult is a case class, which is immutable by default. Therefore, its properties cannot be modified after it is created.
