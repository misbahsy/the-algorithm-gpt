The `CompactPromptMessageContentMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `CompactPromptMessageContent` objects into `urt.MessageContent` objects. This class is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves creating and rendering various types of messages.

The `CompactPromptMessageContent` class represents a compact prompt message that can be displayed to a user. It contains various fields such as `headerText`, `bodyText`, `primaryButtonAction`, `secondaryButtonAction`, `action`, `headerRichText`, and `bodyRichText`. These fields are used to construct a `urt.CompactPrompt` object, which is then used to create a `urt.MessageContent` object.

The `apply` method takes a `CompactPromptMessageContent` object as input and returns a `urt.MessageContent` object. It constructs a `urt.CompactPrompt` object using the fields of the input object and the `messageTextActionMarshaller`, `messageActionMarshaller`, and `richTextMarshaller` objects. These objects are injected into the class via the constructor.

The `messageTextActionMarshaller` and `messageActionMarshaller` objects are responsible for marshalling `MessageTextAction` and `MessageAction` objects, respectively. These objects likely represent actions that can be taken when the user interacts with the message.

The `richTextMarshaller` object is responsible for marshalling `RichText` objects. These objects likely represent formatted text that can be displayed in the message.

Overall, the `CompactPromptMessageContentMarshaller` class is an important component of the larger message rendering system in The Algorithm from Twitter project. It takes in a specific type of message content and converts it into a format that can be displayed to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a specific type of message content called CompactPromptMessageContent. It converts instances of this class into a Thrift message content object.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including MessageTextActionMarshaller, MessageActionMarshaller, and RichTextMarshaller. These are all imported at the beginning of the file.

3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that the constructor of this class should be automatically injected with instances of the classes it depends on (such as MessageTextActionMarshaller and RichTextMarshaller).
