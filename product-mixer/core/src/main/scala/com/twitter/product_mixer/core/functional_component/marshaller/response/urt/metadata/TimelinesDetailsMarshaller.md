The TimelinesDetailsMarshaller class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling the TimelinesDetails object into a Thrift-compatible format. 

The TimelinesDetails object is an instance of the TimelinesDetails class from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata package. It contains information about the timelines, such as the injection type, controller data, and source data. 

The apply method in the TimelinesDetailsMarshaller class takes in a TimelinesDetails object and returns a Thrift-compatible urt.TimelinesDetails object. This object has the same fields as the TimelinesDetails object, but in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized using Thrift. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert TimelinesDetails objects into a format that can be sent over the wire using Thrift. For example, if the project needs to send a TimelinesDetails object over the network, it can use this class to convert the object into a Thrift-compatible format before sending it. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```scala
val timelinesDetails = TimelinesDetails(
  injectionType = "type1",
  controllerData = "data1",
  sourceData = "data2"
)

val marshaller = new TimelinesDetailsMarshaller()
val thriftTimelinesDetails = marshaller(timelinesDetails)
```

In this example, a TimelinesDetails object is created with some sample data. Then, a new instance of the TimelinesDetailsMarshaller class is created. Finally, the TimelinesDetails object is passed to the apply method of the marshaller, which returns a Thrift-compatible urt.TimelinesDetails object. This object can now be sent over the network using Thrift.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for converting `TimelinesDetails` objects to `urt.TimelinesDetails` objects. It is used in the functional component of the product mixer core for marshalling response metadata.

2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` annotation and why is it used here?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the `TimelinesDetailsMarshaller` class should be created and used throughout the application. This is useful for reducing memory usage and improving performance.

3. What is the role of the `Inject` annotation and how does it work?
   - The `Inject` annotation is used to indicate that the `TimelinesDetailsMarshaller` class should be instantiated and managed by a dependency injection framework. In this case, the framework will create an instance of the class and inject it into any other classes that require it as a dependency.
