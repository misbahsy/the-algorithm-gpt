The `PromptItemMarshaller` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling a `PromptItem` object into a `TimelineItemContent` object, which is used to render a prompt in a user's timeline. 

The `PromptItem` object contains information about the prompt, such as its content and any associated client event information or impression callbacks. The `PromptItemMarshaller` class takes this information and converts it into a `TimelineItemContent` object that can be rendered in the user's timeline.

The `PromptItemMarshaller` class has three dependencies injected into it: `PromptContentMarshaller`, `ClientEventInfoMarshaller`, and `CallbackMarshaller`. These dependencies are used to marshal the content, client event information, and impression callbacks of the `PromptItem` object, respectively.

The `apply` method of the `PromptItemMarshaller` class takes a `PromptItem` object as input and returns a `TimelineItemContent` object. The `TimelineItemContent` object is created using the `urt.TimelineItemContent.Prompt` constructor, which takes a `urt.Prompt` object as input. The `urt.Prompt` object is created using the information from the `PromptItem` object and the injected dependencies.

Here is an example of how the `PromptItemMarshaller` class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val promptItem = PromptItem(
  content = "Click here to learn more!",
  clientEventInfo = Some(ClientEventInfo("click", Map("url" -> "https://example.com"))),
  impressionCallbacks = Some(List(Callback("https://example.com/impression"))))
val promptItemMarshaller = PromptItemMarshaller(
  PromptContentMarshaller(),
  ClientEventInfoMarshaller(),
  CallbackMarshaller())
val timelineItemContent = promptItemMarshaller(promptItem)
```

In this example, a `PromptItem` object is created with some sample content, client event information, and impression callbacks. The `PromptItemMarshaller` object is then created with the necessary dependencies injected into it. Finally, the `PromptItem` object is marshalled into a `TimelineItemContent` object using the `PromptItemMarshaller` object's `apply` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a prompt item in a response from a Twitter product mixer. It converts a PromptItem object into a TimelineItemContent object from the urt package.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several other classes and packages, including PromptContentMarshaller, ClientEventInfoMarshaller, CallbackMarshaller, PromptItem, and urt.TimelineItemContent from the timelines.render.thriftscala package.
3. What design pattern is being used in this code?
   - This code is using the dependency injection design pattern, as indicated by the @Inject and @Singleton annotations. The PromptItemMarshaller class is being injected with instances of other classes it depends on, which are provided by a dependency injection framework.
