The `TopicFollowPromptDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` objects into `urt.TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` objects. 

The `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` is an enumeration that represents the different types of topic follow prompt display types. The `urt.TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same concept in the Thrift protocol. 

The `apply` method takes a `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` object as input and returns the corresponding `urt.TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` object. The method uses pattern matching to determine the type of the input object and returns the appropriate Thrift object. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` objects into Thrift objects for serialization and deserialization. For example, if the project needs to send a `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` object over the network, it can use this class to convert the object into a Thrift object and then send it. On the receiving end, the Thrift object can be converted back into a `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` object using a similar marshaller class. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:

```
val topicFollowPromptDisplayType = TopicFocusTopicFollowPromptDisplayType
val marshaller = new TopicFollowPromptDisplayTypeMarshaller()
val thriftObject = marshaller(topicFollowPromptDisplayType)
// send the thriftObject over the network
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a marshaller for converting a `TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` object into a `urt.TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` object. A smart developer might want to know where this marshaller is used and how it fits into the overall functionality of the project.

2. What are the differences between `IncentiveFocusTopicFollowPromptDisplayType` and `TopicFocusTopicFollowPromptDisplayType`?
- These two types are used in a `match` statement to determine which type of `urt.TopicFollowPromptDisplayType` to return. A smart developer might want to know the specific differences between these two types and how they affect the output of the marshaller.

3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and used throughout the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection. A smart developer might want to know more about how these annotations are used in the project and what other classes might be using this marshaller.
