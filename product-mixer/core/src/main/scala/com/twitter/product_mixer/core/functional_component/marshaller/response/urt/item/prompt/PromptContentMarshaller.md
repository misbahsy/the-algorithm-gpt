The `PromptContentMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting `PromptContent` objects into `urt.PromptContent` objects. 

The `PromptContent` class is a model class that represents the content of a prompt. The `RelevancePromptContent` class is a subclass of `PromptContent` that represents a prompt with relevance information. The `urt` package contains Thrift-generated classes that are used for rendering timelines.

The `PromptContentMarshaller` class is annotated with `@Singleton` and is injected with a `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` object. The `apply` method takes a `PromptContent` object as input and returns a `urt.PromptContent` object. If the input `PromptContent` object is an instance of `RelevancePromptContent`, the `apply` method calls the `relevancePromptContentMarshaller` object to convert the `RelevancePromptContent` object into a `urt.PromptContent.RelevancePrompt` object.

This class is used in the larger project to convert `PromptContent` objects into `urt.PromptContent` objects for rendering timelines. Here is an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```
val promptContent: PromptContent = new RelevancePromptContent("Some prompt content", 0.5)
val promptContentMarshaller: PromptContentMarshaller = new PromptContentMarshaller(new RelevancePromptContentMarshaller())
val urtPromptContent: urt.PromptContent = promptContentMarshaller(promptContent)
```

In this example, a `PromptContent` object is created with some prompt content and a relevance score of 0.5. A `PromptContentMarshaller` object is created with a `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` object injected into it. The `PromptContentMarshaller` object is then used to convert the `PromptContent` object into a `urt.PromptContent` object. The resulting `urt.PromptContent` object can then be used for rendering timelines.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a class called `PromptContentMarshaller` that takes in a `PromptContent` object and returns a `urt.PromptContent` object. It seems to be related to marshalling response data for a product mixer application.
2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to indicate that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected by a dependency injection framework.
3. What is the purpose of the `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` parameter in the constructor?
   - The `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` is a dependency that is injected into the `PromptContentMarshaller` class. It is likely used to handle the marshalling of a specific type of `PromptContent` object called `RelevancePromptContent`.
