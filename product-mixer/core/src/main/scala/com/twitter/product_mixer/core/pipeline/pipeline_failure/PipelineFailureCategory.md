This code defines a set of sealed traits and case objects that represent different categories of failures that can occur in a product pipeline. The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of categorizing pipeline failures based on which party is responsible for the issue. This is important for generating accurate SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and ensuring that the correct team is alerted when a failure occurs.

The `PipelineFailureCategory` trait is the parent trait for all failure categories and defines two properties: `categoryName` and `failureName`. The former is a string that represents the name of the category, while the latter is a string that represents the name of the specific failure within that category.

The `ClientFailure` trait is a sub-trait of `PipelineFailureCategory` and represents failures where the client is deemed responsible for the issue. This includes issues such as issuing an invalid request or not having the right permissions. There are several case objects that extend `ClientFailure`, each representing a specific type of failure such as `ProductDisabled`, `BadRequest`, `Authentication`, `Unauthorized`, `NotFound`, `MalformedCursor`, and `ClosedGate`.

The `ServerFailure` trait is another sub-trait of `PipelineFailureCategory` and represents failures for which the owner of the product is responsible. This includes issues such as an issue within Product Mixer or a dependent service preventing the request from succeeding. There are several case objects that extend `ServerFailure`, each representing a specific type of failure such as `UncategorizedServerFailure`, `MisconfiguredFeatureMapFailure`, `InvalidPipelineSelected`, `IllegalStateFailure`, `UnexpectedCandidateResult`, `UnexpectedCandidateInMarshaller`, `MisconfiguredQualityFactor`, `MisconfiguredDecorator`, and `CandidateSourceTimeout`.

The `PlatformFailure` trait is the final sub-trait of `PipelineFailureCategory` and represents issues in the core Product Mixer logic itself which prevent a pipeline from properly executing. These failures are the responsibility of the Product Mixer team. There are two case objects that extend `PlatformFailure`: `ExecutionFailed` and `FeatureHydrationFailed`.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way of categorizing pipeline failures based on their root cause. This can be used in the larger project to generate accurate SLOs and ensure that the correct team is alerted when a failure occurs. For example, if a `ProductDisabled` failure occurs, the team responsible for the client can be alerted, while if an `ExecutionFailed` failure occurs, the Product Mixer team can be alerted.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a sealed trait and several case objects and traits that represent different categories of failures in a product mixing pipeline. 

2. How are these failure categories used in the pipeline?
- These failure categories are used to accurately track and report failures in the pipeline, as well as to alert the correct team responsible for addressing the issue. 

3. What is the difference between a ClientFailure and a ServerFailure?
- A ClientFailure is a failure where the client is deemed responsible for the issue, while a ServerFailure is a failure for which the owner of the product is responsible. ClientFailures are related to behavior on the client side, while ServerFailures are related to issues within the product or dependent services.
