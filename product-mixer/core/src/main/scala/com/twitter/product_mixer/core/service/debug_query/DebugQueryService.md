The `DebugQueryService` class is a service that returns the complete execution log for a pipeline query. It is intended for debugging purposes, primarily through Turntable. 

The class takes in several dependencies, including a `ProductPipelineRegistry`, a `ParamsBuilder`, and an `AuthorizationService`. It also has a private `mapper` field that is used to serialize the detailed result of the pipeline query into JSON format. 

The `apply` method is the main entry point for the service. It takes in a `unmarshaller` function that converts a `MixerServiceRequest` into a `MixerRequest`. It also takes in a `TypeTag` for the `MixerRequest`. The method returns a `Service` that takes in a `ScroogeRequest` and returns a `ScroogeResponse` containing the serialized JSON result of the pipeline query. 

Inside the `apply` method, the `thriftRequest` is first converted into a `MixerRequest` using the `unmarshaller` function. The `ParamsBuilder` is then used to build the `params` object, which contains the client context, product, and feature overrides. 

The `ProductPipelineRegistry` is then used to retrieve the `productPipeline` for the given product. The `verifyRequestAuthorization` method is called to verify that the request is authorized to access the pipeline. 

The `Stitch.run` method is then called on the `productPipeline` with a `ProductPipelineRequest` containing the `request` and `params`. The result is then serialized into JSON format using the `mapper` and returned as a `ScroogeResponse`. 

Overall, the `DebugQueryService` is a useful debugging tool for the larger project, as it allows developers to inspect the complete execution log of a pipeline query. It is designed to work with Turntable and is intended for internal use only.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a service called DebugQueryService that returns the complete execution log for a pipeline query, primarily for debugging purposes through Turntable.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Finagle, Scrooge, Stitch, and Jackson.

3. What is the role of the verifyRequestAuthorization method?
- The verifyRequestAuthorization method is responsible for verifying the authorization of a request based on the product and product pipeline being accessed, the service identifier, and the debug access policies of the product pipeline.
