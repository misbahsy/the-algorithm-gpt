This code defines several traits and case classes related to social context metadata for a product mixer core model. The `SocialContext` trait is sealed, meaning that all implementations of this trait must be declared in this file. The `HasSocialContext` trait requires that any class implementing it must have an optional `SocialContext` field. 

The `GeneralContextType` trait is also sealed and defines several case objects representing different types of general social context, such as likes, follows, and retweets. The `GeneralContext` case class takes in a `GeneralContextType`, a text string, an optional URL, an optional list of context image URLs, and an optional landing URL. This case class extends the `SocialContext` trait.

The `TopicContextFunctionalityType` trait is also sealed and defines several case objects representing different types of functionality for topic context. The `TopicContext` case class takes in a topic ID string and an optional `TopicContextFunctionalityType`. This case class also extends the `SocialContext` trait.

Overall, this code provides a framework for defining and storing social context metadata for a product mixer core model. This metadata can be used to provide additional information about user interactions with social media content, such as the type of interaction (like, follow, etc.) and the topic being discussed. This information can then be used to inform product recommendations and other features of the larger project. 

Example usage:
```
val generalContext = GeneralContext(LikeGeneralContextType, "Liked this post", Some("https://twitter.com/post"), None, None)
val topicContext = TopicContext("12345", Some(BasicTopicContextFunctionalityType))
val hasSocialContextObj = new MyClass with HasSocialContext {
  override def socialContext: Option[SocialContext] = Some(generalContext)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SocialContext` trait and how is it used in the code?
- The `SocialContext` trait is a sealed trait that is extended by case classes `GeneralContext` and `TopicContext`. It is used to define the social context of a response object.

2. What is the difference between `GeneralContextType` and `TopicContextFunctionalityType`?
- `GeneralContextType` is an enumeration of different types of general social contexts, while `TopicContextFunctionalityType` is an enumeration of different types of topic-specific social contexts.

3. What is the significance of the `landingUrl` field in the `GeneralContext` case class?
- The `landingUrl` field is an optional field that specifies the URL to which a user should be directed when they click on the social context object.
