The code defines a case class called TimelinesDetails, which is used to represent metadata related to timelines in the context of the larger project. The case class has three fields: injectionType, controllerData, and sourceData, all of which are optional. 

The injectionType field represents the type of injection used for the timeline, which could be "push" or "pull". The controllerData field represents any additional data associated with the timeline controller, and the sourceData field represents any additional data associated with the timeline source. 

This case class is likely used in the larger project to store and pass around metadata related to timelines. For example, it could be used in a method that retrieves timeline data from a database and needs to return additional metadata about the timeline. 

Here is an example of how this case class could be used in code:

```
val timelineDetails = TimelinesDetails(Some("push"), Some("controller data"), None)
```

This creates a new instance of the TimelinesDetails case class with the injectionType set to "push", the controllerData set to "controller data", and the sourceData set to None. This instance could then be passed to other methods or stored in a database as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the TimelinesDetails case class?
- The TimelinesDetails case class is used for marshalling response metadata related to timelines in the product mixer core model.

2. What does the injectionType field represent?
- The injectionType field is an optional string that likely represents the type of injection used in the timeline.

3. What is the significance of the controllerData and sourceData fields?
- The controllerData and sourceData fields are both optional strings that likely contain additional metadata related to the timeline's controller and source, respectively.
