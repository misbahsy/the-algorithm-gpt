The code defines three classes that are used to build a DataRecord from a FeatureMap. A FeatureMap is a collection of features that can be used to represent an entity. The purpose of the code is to provide a way to build a DataRecord from a FeatureMap that includes only the desired features. 

The `FeaturesScope` trait is the base trait for the three classes. It defines two methods: `getNonFeatureStoreDataRecordFeatures` and `getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord`. The former returns a sequence of features that are not Feature Store features, while the latter returns a `SRichDataRecord` that contains all Feature Store features. 

The `AllFeatures` class is used to build a DataRecord that includes all features in the FeatureMap. It implements the `FeaturesScope` trait and overrides the two methods. The `getNonFeatureStoreDataRecordFeatures` method returns all non-Feature Store features in the FeatureMap. The `getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord` method returns a `SRichDataRecord` that contains all Feature Store features. 

The `SpecificFeatures` class is used to build a DataRecord that includes only the specified features. It takes a set of features as a parameter and implements the `FeaturesScope` trait. The `getNonFeatureStoreDataRecordFeatures` method returns only the specified features that are not Feature Store features. The `getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord` method returns a `SRichDataRecord` that contains only the specified Feature Store features. 

The `AllExceptFeatures` class is used to build a DataRecord that includes all features except the specified ones. It takes a set of features to exclude as a parameter and implements the `FeaturesScope` trait. The `getNonFeatureStoreDataRecordFeatures` method returns all non-Feature Store features in the FeatureMap except the specified ones. The `getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord` method returns a `SRichDataRecord` that contains all Feature Store features except the specified ones. 

Overall, this code provides a way to build a DataRecord from a FeatureMap that includes only the desired features. This can be useful in machine learning applications where only certain features are needed for a particular model. For example, if a model only needs a subset of the features in a FeatureMap, the `SpecificFeatures` class can be used to build a DataRecord that includes only those features.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FeaturesScope` trait and its subclasses?
- The `FeaturesScope` trait and its subclasses define what features should be included in a `DataRecord` from a `FeatureMap`, with `AllFeatures` including all features, `SpecificFeatures` including only specified features, and `AllExceptFeatures` including all features except for specified ones.

2. What is the role of `FeatureStoreV1ResponseFeature` in this code?
- `FeatureStoreV1ResponseFeature` is a feature that is not directly in the `FeatureMap` but instead lives aggregated in a `DataRecord`. It is used to interface with the underlying `DataRecord` in the `FeaturesScope` subclasses.

3. What is the purpose of `getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord` in the `FeaturesScope` trait?
- `getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord` is a method in the `FeaturesScope` trait that returns the underlying `DataRecord` for feature store features in a `FeatureMap`. It is used in the `AllFeatures` and `SpecificFeatures` subclasses to handle feature store features that are not directly in the `FeatureMap`.
