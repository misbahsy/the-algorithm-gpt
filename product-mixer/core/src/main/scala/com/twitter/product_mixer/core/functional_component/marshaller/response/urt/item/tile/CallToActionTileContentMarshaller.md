The `CallToActionTileContentMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `CallToActionTileContent` objects into `urt.TileContentCallToAction` objects. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves rendering timelines or other types of content.

The `CallToActionTileContent` class represents the content of a tile that includes a call-to-action button. It contains a text field, a rich text field, and a call-to-action button field. The `CallToActionTileContentMarshaller` class takes an instance of `CallToActionTileContent` and returns a `urt.TileContentCallToAction` object, which is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same content.

The `apply` method of the `CallToActionTileContentMarshaller` class takes a `CallToActionTileContent` object as input and returns a `urt.TileContentCallToAction` object. It does this by extracting the `text`, `richText`, and `ctaButton` fields from the input object and mapping them to the corresponding fields in the output object. The `richText` and `ctaButton` fields are optional, so they are only included in the output object if they are present in the input object.

The `CallToActionTileContentMarshaller` class depends on two other classes: `CtaButtonMarshaller` and `RichTextMarshaller`. These classes are responsible for marshalling `CtaButton` and `RichText` objects, respectively, into their Thrift-generated counterparts. The `CallToActionTileContentMarshaller` class injects instances of these classes into its constructor using the `@Inject` annotation.

Overall, the `CallToActionTileContentMarshaller` class is a small but important component of a larger system for rendering timelines or other types of content. It takes care of converting `CallToActionTileContent` objects into Thrift-generated objects that can be used by other parts of the system. Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```
val ctaTileContent = CallToActionTileContent(
  text = "Click here for more information",
  richText = Some(RichText("Click ", RichTextStyle.Bold), RichText("here", RichTextStyle.Link("https://example.com"))),
  ctaButton = Some(CtaButton("Learn More", "https://example.com"))
)

val marshaller = new CallToActionTileContentMarshaller(new CtaButtonMarshaller(), new RichTextMarshaller())
val tileContent = marshaller(ctaTileContent)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a CallToActionTileContent object, which converts it into a TileContentCallToAction object. It uses two other marshallers for CtaButton and RichText objects.
   
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the CtaButtonMarshaller and RichTextMarshaller classes, as well as the CallToActionTileContent and TileContentCallToAction classes from different packages. It also uses the javax.inject.Singleton annotation.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply method?
   - The apply method takes a CallToActionTileContent object as input and returns a TileContentCallToAction object. It maps the text, richText, and ctaButton fields of the input object to the corresponding fields of the output object.
