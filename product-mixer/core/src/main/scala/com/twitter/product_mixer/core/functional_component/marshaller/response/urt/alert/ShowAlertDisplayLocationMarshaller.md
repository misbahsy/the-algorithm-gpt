The `ShowAlertDisplayLocationMarshaller` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for marshalling the `ShowAlertDisplayLocation` enum values into their corresponding `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation` thriftscala values. This class is annotated with `@Singleton` and `@Inject` to indicate that it is a singleton and can be injected into other classes.

The `apply` method takes an instance of `ShowAlertDisplayLocation` as input and returns an instance of `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation`. The input is matched against the `Top` and `Bottom` enum values and returns the corresponding `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation` value. If the input is `Top`, it returns `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation.Top`, and if the input is `Bottom`, it returns `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation.Bottom`.

This class is used in the larger project to convert the `ShowAlertDisplayLocation` enum values into their corresponding `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation` thriftscala values. This is useful when working with thriftscala objects that require `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation` values as input. 

Example usage:

```
val marshaller = new ShowAlertDisplayLocationMarshaller()
val showAlertDisplayLocation = ShowAlertDisplayLocation.Top
val urtShowAlertDisplayLocation = marshaller(showAlertDisplayLocation)
// urtShowAlertDisplayLocation is now urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation.Top
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a `ShowAlertDisplayLocation` object to a `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation` object. It maps the `Top` and `Bottom` cases of `ShowAlertDisplayLocation` to the corresponding cases of `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation`.
   
2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   - This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `ShowAlertDisplayLocation`, `Top`, `Bottom`, `urt.ShowAlertDisplayLocation`, and `com.twitter.timelines.render.{thriftscala => urt}`. It also uses the `javax.inject` and `javax.inject.Singleton` annotations.
   
3. What is the significance of the `@Inject` and `@Singleton` annotations?
   - The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor of the class as eligible for dependency injection. The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the class should be created and shared across the application.
