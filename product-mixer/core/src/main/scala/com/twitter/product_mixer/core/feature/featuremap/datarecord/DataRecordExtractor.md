The `DataRecordExtractor` class is responsible for constructing a `FeatureMap` object from a `DataRecord` object, given a predefined set of features. The purpose of this class is to extract relevant features from a `DataRecord` and create a `FeatureMap` that can be used in further processing. 

The `DataRecordExtractor` class takes a set of `BaseDataRecordFeature` objects as input, which are used to define the set of features that should be included in the output `FeatureMap`. The `fromDataRecord` method takes a `DataRecord` object as input and returns a `FeatureMap` object. 

The `fromDataRecord` method first creates a `FeatureMapBuilder` object, which is used to construct the `FeatureMap`. It then creates a `SRichDataRecord` object from the input `DataRecord` and the predefined set of features. The `SRichDataRecord` object provides a convenient way to access the features of the `DataRecord` using the `FeatureContext` object. 

The method then iterates over the set of predefined features and extracts the feature values from the `DataRecord`. If the feature is a `DataRecordFeature`, it extracts the feature value using the `fromDataRecordFeatureValue` method and adds it to the `FeatureMapBuilder`. If the feature is a `DataRecordOptionalFeature`, it extracts the feature value using the same method and adds it to the `FeatureMapBuilder` as an `Option`. If the required feature is missing, it adds a `PipelineFailure` object to the `FeatureMapBuilder`. 

If the feature is a `FeatureStoreDataRecordFeature` or a `DataRecordInAFeature`, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, as these features are currently not supported. 

Overall, the `DataRecordExtractor` class is an important component of the larger project, as it allows for the extraction of relevant features from a `DataRecord` object and the creation of a `FeatureMap` object that can be used in further processing. 

Example usage:

```scala
val features = Set(MyDataRecordFeature1, MyDataRecordFeature2)
val extractor = new DataRecordExtractor(features)
val dataRecord = // create a DataRecord object
val featureMap = extractor.fromDataRecord(dataRecord)
// use the featureMap in further processing
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code constructs a DataRecord from a FeatureMap, given a predefined set of features. It is likely used as part of a larger pipeline or process for analyzing data.

2. What is the significance of the `DataRecordExtractor` class and its constructor parameters?
- The `DataRecordExtractor` class is responsible for extracting data from a `DataRecord` object and constructing a `FeatureMap`. Its constructor takes in a set of `BaseDataRecordFeature` objects that define the features to be included in the output `DataRecord`.

3. What are the limitations of this code and what features are currently not supported?
- The code currently does not support `FeatureStoreDataRecordFeature` and `DataRecordInAFeature`. Additionally, the Java API may return null values, which are converted to Scala `Option` objects.
