The `PrerollMarshaller` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting a `Preroll` object from the project's internal model to a `urt.Preroll` object from the `timelines.render` package. This conversion is necessary for the `Preroll` object to be used in other parts of the project that require a `urt.Preroll` object.

The `PrerollMarshaller` class is a singleton, meaning that there is only one instance of this class throughout the entire project. This is achieved through the use of the `@Singleton` annotation. The class has two dependencies injected into it: `dynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller` and `mediaInfoMarshaller`. These dependencies are instances of other marshaller classes that are responsible for converting the `dynamicPrerollType` and `mediaInfo` fields of the `Preroll` object to their corresponding fields in the `urt.Preroll` object.

The `apply` method of the `PrerollMarshaller` class takes a `Preroll` object as input and returns a `urt.Preroll` object. The method uses the `urt.Preroll` constructor to create a new `urt.Preroll` object and sets its fields using the corresponding fields from the input `Preroll` object. The `dynamicPrerollType` and `mediaInfo` fields are converted using the injected marshaller dependencies.

Here is an example of how the `PrerollMarshaller` class might be used in the larger project:

```
val preroll: Preroll = // create a Preroll object
val prerollMarshaller: PrerollMarshaller = // get the singleton instance of the PrerollMarshaller class
val urtPreroll: urt.Preroll = prerollMarshaller(preroll) // convert the Preroll object to a urt.Preroll object
// use the urtPreroll object in other parts of the project that require a urt.Preroll object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a Preroll object and converts it into a thriftscala.ur.Preroll object. It uses two other marshallers to convert the dynamicPrerollType and mediaInfo fields of the Preroll object.
2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   - This code depends on two other marshallers: DynamicPrerollTypeMarshaller and MediaInfoMarshaller. It also imports classes from com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.promoted and com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala packages.
3. What design pattern is being used in this code?
   - This code is using the Singleton design pattern, as indicated by the @Singleton annotation on the class definition. This ensures that only one instance of the class is created and used throughout the application.
