This code defines a set of classes and traits related to URT (Unified Rich Timelines) Prompts, which are used to collect feedback from users about their timeline. The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent different types of URT Prompts and their associated metadata in a structured way.

The `PromptContent` trait is a sealed trait that represents the base type for all URT Prompts. It is used to define common functionality and metadata that is shared across all types of URT Prompts. The `RelevancePromptContent` case class is a concrete implementation of the `PromptContent` trait that represents a specific type of URT Prompt called the Relevance Prompt. The Relevance Prompt is a Yes-No style prompt that is used to collect feedback from users about a part of their timeline.

The `RelevancePromptContent` case class has several fields that define the metadata associated with the Relevance Prompt, such as the title of the prompt, the confirmation message, the text for the "Yes" and "No" buttons, and the callbacks that are triggered when the user clicks on each button. It also has fields for defining the display type of the prompt and any follow-up feedback types that may be associated with the "Yes" and "No" responses.

This code is likely used in the larger URT project to provide a way to represent and manipulate URT Prompts in a structured way. For example, other parts of the project may use these classes to create and display URT Prompts to users, or to process the feedback that is collected from users in response to these prompts. Here is an example of how the `RelevancePromptContent` class might be used in the larger project:

```
val prompt = RelevancePromptContent(
  title = "Is this tweet relevant to you?",
  confirmation = "Please confirm your response",
  isRelevantText = "Yes",
  notRelevantText = "No",
  isRelevantCallback = Callback("http://example.com/yes"),
  notRelevantCallback = Callback("http://example.com/no"),
  displayType = RelevancePromptDisplayType.Default,
  isRelevantFollowUp = Some(RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType("Please tell us why this tweet is relevant to you")),
  notRelevantFollowUp = Some(RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType("Please tell us why this tweet is not relevant to you"))
)

// Display the prompt to the user and wait for their response
val response = displayPrompt(prompt)

// Process the user's response
if (response == "Yes") {
  // Do something if the user clicked "Yes"
} else {
  // Do something else if the user clicked "No"
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PromptContent` trait and how is it used in the code?
- The `PromptContent` trait represents different types of URT prompts and is used as a base trait for other prompt types to extend from.

2. What is the `RelevancePromptContent` case class and what parameters does it take?
- The `RelevancePromptContent` case class represents a Yes-No style prompt used for collecting feedback from a user about a part of their timeline. It takes parameters for the title, confirmation message, text for when the user selects "is relevant" or "not relevant", callback functions for each selection, display type, and optional follow-up feedback types.

3. What is the purpose of the `Callback` class and how is it used in the `RelevancePromptContent` case class?
- The `Callback` class is used to represent a callback function that can be executed when a user selects a certain option in the prompt. In the `RelevancePromptContent` case class, it is used as a parameter for the `isRelevantCallback` and `notRelevantCallback` options.
