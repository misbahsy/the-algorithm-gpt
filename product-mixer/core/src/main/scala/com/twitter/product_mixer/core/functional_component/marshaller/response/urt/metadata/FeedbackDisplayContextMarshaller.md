The `FeedbackDisplayContextMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This specific class is responsible for marshalling `FeedbackDisplayContext` objects into `urt.FeedbackDisplayContext` objects. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert `FeedbackDisplayContext` objects into a format that can be used by other parts of the project. This is done by defining a method called `apply` that takes a `FeedbackDisplayContext` object as input and returns a `urt.FeedbackDisplayContext` object. 

The `FeedbackDisplayContext` object contains a single field called `reason`, which is a string that represents the reason for displaying feedback. The `apply` method simply takes this `reason` field and uses it to create a new `urt.FeedbackDisplayContext` object with the same `reason` field. 

This class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire project. This is useful for performance reasons, as creating new instances of this class can be expensive. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val feedbackDisplayContext = FeedbackDisplayContext("This is a test feedback message.")
val feedbackDisplayContextMarshaller = new FeedbackDisplayContextMarshaller()
val urtFeedbackDisplayContext = feedbackDisplayContextMarshaller(feedbackDisplayContext)
```

In this example, a new `FeedbackDisplayContext` object is created with the message "This is a test feedback message." Then, a new instance of the `FeedbackDisplayContextMarshaller` class is created. Finally, the `apply` method is called on the `feedbackDisplayContextMarshaller` object with the `feedbackDisplayContext` object as input. The result is a new `urt.FeedbackDisplayContext` object with the same `reason` field as the original `FeedbackDisplayContext` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a feedback display context object. It converts a FeedbackDisplayContext object to a thriftscala.FeedbackDisplayContext object.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata.FeedbackDisplayContext class and the thriftscala.FeedbackDisplayContext class from the com.twitter.timelines.render package.

3. Why is the FeedbackDisplayContextMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class can be injected as a dependency into other classes that require a FeedbackDisplayContextMarshaller object.
