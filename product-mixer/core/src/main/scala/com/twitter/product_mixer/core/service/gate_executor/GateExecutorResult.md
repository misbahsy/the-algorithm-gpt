The code above defines a case class called `GateExecutorResult` that extends the `ExecutorResult` trait. This class takes in a sequence of `ExecutedGateResult` objects as a parameter and stores them in a field called `individualGateResults`. 

In the larger project, this class is likely used to represent the results of executing a gate in the product mixer service. A gate is a component of the product mixer that filters or modifies products based on certain criteria. The `GateExecutorResult` class allows for the storage and retrieval of the results of executing a gate, which can then be used to determine the final output of the product mixer service.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the context of the product mixer service:

```scala
val gateResults: Seq[ExecutedGateResult] = executeGate(gate)
val executorResult: GateExecutorResult = GateExecutorResult(gateResults)
```

In this example, `executeGate` is a function that takes in a `Gate` object and returns a sequence of `ExecutedGateResult` objects. These results are then passed into the `GateExecutorResult` constructor to create a new `GateExecutorResult` object. This object can then be used to determine the final output of the product mixer service based on the results of executing the gate.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GateExecutorResult` class?
   - The `GateExecutorResult` class is used to store the results of executed gates in a sequence.

2. What is the significance of the `ExecutorResult` trait?
   - The `GateExecutorResult` class extends the `ExecutorResult` trait, which suggests that it is part of a larger system that involves executing some sort of task or operation.

3. What is the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.service` package?
   - The `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.service` package likely contains classes and functionality related to a product mixing service provided by Twitter.
