The code is a Scala class called RelevancePromptDisplayTypeMarshaller that is responsible for marshalling RelevancePromptDisplayType objects into their corresponding thriftscala.urt.RelevancePromptDisplayType objects. The class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and displaying prompts to users in some way.

The class is annotated with @Singleton, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The apply method takes a RelevancePromptDisplayType object as input and returns the corresponding urt.RelevancePromptDisplayType object. The RelevancePromptDisplayType object is an enumeration that represents the different display types for relevance prompts. The urt.RelevancePromptDisplayType object is a thriftscala object that is used to communicate with other services or components in the application.

The apply method uses pattern matching to determine which RelevancePromptDisplayType object was passed in and returns the corresponding urt.RelevancePromptDisplayType object. For example, if the input is Normal, the method returns urt.RelevancePromptDisplayType.Normal. This allows the application to easily convert between the two types of objects as needed.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
val marshaller = new RelevancePromptDisplayTypeMarshaller()
val relevancePromptDisplayType = Normal
val urtRelevancePromptDisplayType = marshaller(relevancePromptDisplayType)
// use urtRelevancePromptDisplayType in communication with other services or components
```

In this example, a new instance of the marshaller is created, and a RelevancePromptDisplayType object is created with the value Normal. The marshaller is then used to convert the RelevancePromptDisplayType object into a urt.RelevancePromptDisplayType object, which can be used to communicate with other services or components in the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
   - This code is a marshaller for a specific type of response item called `RelevancePromptDisplayType`. It converts instances of this type to their corresponding Thrift Scala representations. A smart developer might want to know where this marshaller is used and how it fits into the overall response handling process.

2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` annotation on the class?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. A smart developer might want to know why this class is designed as a singleton and whether it has any implications for thread safety or performance.

3. Are there any other types of `RelevancePromptDisplayType` that could be added in the future, and how would they be handled by this code?
   - It's possible that new types of `RelevancePromptDisplayType` could be added in the future, and it's unclear how they would be handled by this code. A smart developer might want to know if there are any plans to extend this code to handle new types, or if there are any potential issues with adding new types that would require changes to this code.
