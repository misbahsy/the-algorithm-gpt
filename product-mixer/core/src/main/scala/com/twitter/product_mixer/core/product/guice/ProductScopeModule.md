The code above is a module that registers a custom scope called `@ProductScoped` using the Guice dependency injection framework. This scope is used to manage the lifecycle of objects related to a specific product. 

The `ProductScopeModule` class extends `TwitterModule`, which is a class provided by the Twitter Inject library that simplifies the configuration of Guice modules. The `@Singleton` annotation on the class indicates that only one instance of this module will be created and shared across the application.

The `configure` method is used to bind the `ProductScoped` annotation to the `ProductScope` instance created in the class. This means that any class annotated with `@ProductScoped` will be managed by the `ProductScope` instance. Additionally, the `Product` class is bound to a provider that uses the `ProductScoped` annotation to ensure that only one instance of `Product` is created per product.

The `@Provides` annotation on the `providesProductScope` method indicates that this method provides a `ProductScope` instance to the application. This method simply returns the `ProductScope` instance created in the class.

Overall, this module is used to manage the lifecycle of objects related to a specific product in the larger project. It ensures that only one instance of a `Product` object is created per product and that any other objects related to that product are managed by the same `ProductScope` instance. This helps to prevent issues with object state and ensures that objects related to a specific product are isolated from other products in the system. 

Example usage:

```scala
class ProductService @Inject() (@ProductScoped product: Product) {
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the `ProductService` class is annotated with `@ProductScoped`, indicating that it should be managed by the `ProductScope` instance created in the `ProductScopeModule` class. The `Product` instance is injected into the constructor of the class and is guaranteed to be the same instance for the entire lifecycle of the product.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProductScoped` scope and how is it used in this code?
   - The `ProductScoped` scope is used to manage the lifecycle of `Product` objects and ensure that they are only created once per request. It is registered and bound to the `productScope` instance in this code.
2. What is the relationship between `ProductScopeModule` and `TwitterModule`?
   - `ProductScopeModule` extends `TwitterModule` and overrides its `configure()` method to register the `ProductScoped` scope and bind the `Product` class to the `productScope`. It also provides a method to provide the `productScope` instance.
3. What is the purpose of the `SimpleScope.SEEDED_KEY_PROVIDER` and how is it used in this code?
   - `SimpleScope.SEEDED_KEY_PROVIDER` is a provider that creates a unique key for each `Product` object based on a seed value. It is used to bind the `Product` class to the `ProductScoped` scope in this code.
