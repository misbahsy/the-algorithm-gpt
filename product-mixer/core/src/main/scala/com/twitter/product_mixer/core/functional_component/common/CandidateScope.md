This code defines a set of classes and traits that specify the scope of a functional component (e.g., Gate or Selector) in the context of a CandidateWithDetails object. A CandidateWithDetails object represents a candidate item that is being processed by the algorithm. The functional component is applied to the candidate item based on its scope, which is determined by the CandidateScope trait.

The CandidateScope trait is a sealed trait that has three implementations: AllPipelines, SpecificPipelines, and AllExceptPipelines. AllPipelines applies the functional component to all candidates regardless of which pipeline they came from. SpecificPipelines applies the functional component only to candidates whose CandidatePipelines identifier matches one of the identifiers in the pipelines Set. SpecificPipeline applies the functional component only to candidates whose source is the pipeline specified by the pipeline identifier.

The CandidateScope trait has two methods: contains and partition. The contains method takes a CandidateWithDetails object and returns true if the object is in scope. The partition method takes a sequence of CandidateWithDetails objects and partitions them into those that are in scope and those that are not.

The code also defines a case class called PartitionedCandidates that is used to store the partitioned candidates returned by the partition method.

Overall, this code provides a way to specify the scope of a functional component in the context of a CandidateWithDetails object. This is useful in the larger project because it allows the algorithm to apply different functional components to different candidates based on their scope. For example, a Selector component may be applied only to candidates that match a certain set of criteria, while a Gate component may be applied to all candidates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CandidateScope` trait and its subclasses?
- The `CandidateScope` trait and its subclasses specify whether a functional component should apply to a given `CandidateWithDetails` object based on its pipeline identifier.
2. What is the purpose of the `partition` method in the `CandidateScope` trait?
- The `partition` method partitions a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects into those that the `CandidateScope` contains and those that it does not.
3. What is the purpose of the `AllExceptPipelines` subclass of `CandidateScope`?
- The `AllExceptPipelines` subclass applies a functional component to all candidates except for those whose pipeline identifier is in the `pipelinesToExclude` set.
