The `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` is a trait that defines a feature hydrator for a feature store. It is used to hydrate features for a given set of candidates using a feature store. The trait extends the `BaseBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait and provides an implementation for the `apply` method. The `apply` method takes a query and a sequence of candidates and returns a `Stitch` of feature maps. 

The trait defines a set of features that are used to hydrate the candidates. The features are defined as instances of the `BaseFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeature` class. The trait also defines a `clientBuilder` that is used to build a feature store client. The client is built using a `FeatureStoreV1DynamicClientBuilder` and a `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrationConfig`. The `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrationConfig` is built using the set of features defined earlier. 

The `apply` method first extracts the entities from the set of features. It then creates a `FeatureStoreRequest` for each candidate using the entities and the candidate's features. The `FeatureStoreRequest` is then passed to the feature store client to retrieve the features for each candidate. The response from the feature store is then used to build a `FeatureMap` for each candidate. The `FeatureMap` contains the features for the candidate and any errors that occurred during the hydration process. 

Overall, the `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` trait provides a way to hydrate features for a set of candidates using a feature store. It abstracts away the details of building a feature store client and constructing the feature store requests. It also provides a way to handle errors that occur during the hydration process. 

Example usage:

```scala
val featureHydrator = new FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator[MyQuery, MyCandidate] {
  override def features: Set[BaseFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeature[MyQuery, MyCandidate, _ <: EntityId, _]] = ???
  override def clientBuilder: FeatureStoreV1DynamicClientBuilder = ???
}

val query = MyQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(MyCandidate(...), MyCandidate(...), ...)
val featureMaps: Seq[FeatureMap] = featureHydrator(query, candidates).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a trait called `FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeatureHydrator` which is used to hydrate candidate features from a feature store.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `SRichDataRecord`, `EntityId`, `PredictionRecordAdapter`, `FeatureStoreRequest`, `FeatureMap`, `BaseFeatureStoreV1CandidateFeature`, `FeatureStoreV1CandidateEntity`, `FeatureStoreV1Response`, `BaseBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`, `CandidateWithFeatures`, `UniversalNoun`, `PipelineQuery`, `FeatureHydrationFailed`, `PipelineFailure`, `Stitch`, and `Logging`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects, and returns a `Stitch` of sequences of `FeatureMap` objects. The `FeatureMap` objects contain `FeatureStoreV1Response` objects, which in turn contain hydrated features and any errors that occurred during the hydration process.
