The RectMarshaller class is a part of the functional component of the product mixer core in the Twitter project. Its purpose is to convert a Rect object from the model into a thriftscala Rect object. This conversion is necessary for the Rect object to be used in the rendering of timelines.

The RectMarshaller class is a singleton and is injected with no parameters. It has a single method called apply that takes a Rect object as a parameter and returns a thriftscala Rect object. The Rect object contains four properties: left, top, width, and height. These properties are used to create a new thriftscala Rect object with the same properties.

Here is an example of how the RectMarshaller class can be used:

```
val rect = Rect(left = 10, top = 20, width = 30, height = 40)
val rectMarshaller = new RectMarshaller()
val urtRect = rectMarshaller(rect)
```

In this example, a new Rect object is created with the properties left = 10, top = 20, width = 30, and height = 40. Then, a new instance of the RectMarshaller class is created. Finally, the apply method of the RectMarshaller class is called with the Rect object as a parameter, and a new thriftscala Rect object is returned.

Overall, the RectMarshaller class plays an important role in the larger Twitter project by allowing Rect objects to be used in the rendering of timelines. Its purpose is to convert Rect objects from the model into thriftscala Rect objects, which can be used by other components of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a `Rect` object from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.media` package to a `urt.Rect` object from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package.
2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
3. What other classes or packages are required for this code to work properly?
   - This code requires the `Rect` class from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.media` package and the `urt.Rect` class from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package. It also requires the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation for dependency injection.
