The `FeatureMapBuilder` class is a builder for creating a `FeatureMap`, which is a map of `Feature`s to their values. The purpose of this class is to provide a type-safe way to build a `FeatureMap` by checking the types of the `Feature`s being added. 

The `FeatureMapBuilder` class has several methods for adding `Feature`s to the map. The `add` method takes a `Feature` and a value wrapped in a `Try` and adds it to the map. The `add` method can also take a `Feature` and a value directly, without wrapping it in a `Try`. The `addFailure` method takes a `Feature` and a `Throwable` and adds a failed `Feature` to the map. The `addTry` method is similar to the `add` method, but it is used when the `Feature` types are not known. 

The `FeatureMapBuilder` class also has a method for building the `FeatureMap`. Once the `build` method is called, the `FeatureMapBuilder` cannot be used again. If the `build` method is called more than once, a `ReusedFeatureMapBuilderException` is thrown.

If the same `Feature` is added to the `FeatureMapBuilder` more than once, a `DuplicateFeatureException` is thrown. 

Overall, the `FeatureMapBuilder` class provides a type-safe way to build a `FeatureMap` by checking the types of the `Feature`s being added. This class is used in the larger project to create `FeatureMap`s that are used in other parts of the codebase. 

Example usage:

```
val builder = FeatureMapBuilder()
val feature1 = Feature("feature1", classOf[String])
val feature2 = Feature("feature2", classOf[Int])
builder.add(feature1, "value1")
builder.add(feature2, 42)
val featureMap = builder.build()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the FeatureMapBuilder class?
   
   The FeatureMapBuilder class is a typesafe way to build a FeatureMap, which is a map of Feature objects and their corresponding values.

2. What happens if the same Feature is added more than once?
   
   If the same Feature is added more than once, a DuplicateFeatureException is thrown.

3. Can FeatureMapBuilders be reused?
   
   No, FeatureMapBuilders are not reusable. If build() is called more than once, a ReusedFeatureMapBuilderException is thrown.
