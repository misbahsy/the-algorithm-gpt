The code defines a case class called `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` that extends the `Predicate` trait. This class is used to create a predicate that triggers an alert if a metric rises above a certain latency threshold for a specified duration. The `latencyThreshold` parameter specifies the threshold value for the metric, and must be greater than 0. The `datapointsPastThreshold` parameter specifies the number of data points that must be above the threshold for the alert to trigger. The `duration` parameter specifies the time window over which the data points are collected. The `metricGranularity` parameter specifies the granularity of the metric data, with a default value of `Minutes`.

The `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` class overrides the `threshold` and `operator` values from the `Predicate` trait. The `threshold` value is set to the latency threshold in milliseconds, and the `operator` value is set to `>`. The `require` method is used to ensure that the `latencyThreshold` parameter is greater than 0.

This code can be used in the larger project to create predicates for monitoring metrics and triggering alerts based on certain conditions. For example, if the project is monitoring the response time of a web service, the `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` predicate can be used to trigger an alert if the response time rises above a certain threshold for a specified duration. This can help the project team identify and address performance issues in a timely manner. 

Example usage:

```
val latencyThreshold = Duration.fromSeconds(5)
val datapointsPastThreshold = 3
val duration = 10
val metricGranularity = Seconds

val latencyPredicate = TriggerIfLatencyAbove(latencyThreshold, datapointsPastThreshold, duration, metricGranularity)
```

In this example, a `latencyPredicate` is created using the `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` class with a latency threshold of 5 seconds, 3 data points past the threshold, a duration of 10 seconds, and a metric granularity of seconds. This predicate can be used to monitor the latency of a web service and trigger an alert if the latency rises above 5 seconds for 3 data points within a 10 second window.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a `Predicate` that triggers an alert if a metric rises above a specified latency threshold for a certain number of data points over a specified duration. It helps monitor and detect latency issues in a system.

2. What are the default values for `datapointsPastThreshold` and `duration`?
- The default value for `datapointsPastThreshold` is 10 and the default value for `duration` is 15.

3. What is the significance of the `require` statement in this code?
- The `require` statement checks that the `latencyThreshold` is greater than zero and throws an exception with a custom error message if it is not. This ensures that the `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` predicate is used correctly and avoids potential issues with the alerting system.
