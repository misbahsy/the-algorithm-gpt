The `LiveEventDetailsMarshaller` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling `LiveEventDetails` objects into `urt.LiveEventDetails` objects. 

The `LiveEventDetails` object is a model object that contains details about a live event. The `urt.LiveEventDetails` object is a Thrift-generated object that is used to represent the same data in a different format. 

The `apply` method in the `LiveEventDetailsMarshaller` class takes a `LiveEventDetails` object as input and returns a `urt.LiveEventDetails` object. The `eventId` field of the `urt.LiveEventDetails` object is set to the `eventId` field of the input `LiveEventDetails` object. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert `LiveEventDetails` objects into `urt.LiveEventDetails` objects. This conversion is necessary when communicating with other components of the system that use the Thrift-generated objects. 

Example usage:

```scala
val liveEventDetails = LiveEventDetails(eventId = "12345")
val liveEventDetailsMarshaller = new LiveEventDetailsMarshaller()
val urtLiveEventDetails = liveEventDetailsMarshaller(liveEventDetails)
``` 

In this example, a `LiveEventDetails` object is created with an `eventId` of "12345". A new `LiveEventDetailsMarshaller` object is created, and the `apply` method is called with the `LiveEventDetails` object as input. The resulting `urt.LiveEventDetails` object is stored in the `urtLiveEventDetails` variable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for LiveEventDetails and converts it into a thriftscala LiveEventDetails object.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the LiveEventDetails class from com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata and the thriftscala LiveEventDetails class from com.twitter.timelines.render.
3. Why is the LiveEventDetailsMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class can be injected as a dependency in other classes.
