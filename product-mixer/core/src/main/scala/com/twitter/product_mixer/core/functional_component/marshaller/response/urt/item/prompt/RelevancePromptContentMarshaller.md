The `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `RelevancePromptContent` objects into `urt.RelevancePrompt` objects. This class is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and analyzing data related to user interactions with Twitter content.

The `RelevancePromptContent` class likely represents a prompt that asks the user to rate the relevance of some content, such as a tweet or a search result. The `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` class takes in a `RelevancePromptContent` object and uses its properties to create a `urt.RelevancePrompt` object. The `urt.RelevancePrompt` object likely represents a response to the user's rating of the content.

The `apply` method of the `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` class takes in a `RelevancePromptContent` object and returns a `urt.RelevancePrompt` object. The `urt.RelevancePrompt` object is created using the properties of the `RelevancePromptContent` object. These properties include the title of the prompt, the confirmation message, the text to display if the content is relevant or not relevant, and callbacks to execute if the user rates the content as relevant or not relevant.

The `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` class uses other classes to marshal some of the properties of the `RelevancePromptContent` object. These classes include `CallbackMarshaller`, `RelevancePromptDisplayTypeMarshaller`, and `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackTypeMarshaller`. These classes likely handle the marshalling of specific types of data, such as callbacks or display types.

Overall, the `RelevancePromptContentMarshaller` class is an important component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It likely plays a role in processing and analyzing user interactions with Twitter content, and specifically in prompting users to rate the relevance of that content.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Scala class that marshals a RelevancePromptContent object into a thriftscala RelevancePrompt object.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including CallbackMarshaller, RelevancePromptDisplayTypeMarshaller, RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackTypeMarshaller, and the thriftscala library.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply method?
- The apply method expects a RelevancePromptContent object as input and returns a thriftscala RelevancePrompt object as output.
