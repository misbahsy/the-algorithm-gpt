The `AsyncFeatureMapSerializer` class is responsible for serializing an instance of the `AsyncFeatureMap` class into a JSON object. The purpose of this serializer is to provide a summary of the features that would be hydrated using `AsyncFeatureMap.features`. 

The `AsyncFeatureMap` class is typically incomplete, and by the time it's serialized, all the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature`s it will typically be completed and part of the Query or Candidate's individual `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature`s. Therefore, instead of serializing the entire `AsyncFeatureMap`, this serializer provides a summary of the features that would be hydrated using `AsyncFeatureMap.features`. 

The serialized JSON object indicates which `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature`s will be ready at which steps and which `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator.FeatureHydrator` are responsible for those `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature`s. 

The `serialize` method of the `AsyncFeatureMapSerializer` class takes an instance of the `AsyncFeatureMap` class, a `JsonGenerator` object, and a `SerializerProvider` object as input parameters. The `JsonGenerator` object is used to write the JSON object, and the `SerializerProvider` object is used to access serializers for other types. 

The `serialize` method first writes the start of the JSON object using the `writeStartObject` method of the `JsonGenerator` object. It then iterates over the features in the `AsyncFeatureMap` using the `foreach` method. For each feature, it writes a start object using the `writeObjectFieldStart` method of the `JsonGenerator` object. It then iterates over the feature hydrators using the `foreach` method. For each feature hydrator, it writes a start array using the `writeArrayFieldStart` method of the `JsonGenerator` object. It then iterates over the features from the hydrator using the `foreach` method and writes each feature as a string using the `writeString` method of the `JsonGenerator` object. Finally, it writes the end of the array using the `writeEndArray` method of the `JsonGenerator` object and the end of the object using the `writeEndObject` method of the `JsonGenerator` object. 

Overall, this serializer is an important part of the larger project as it allows for the serialization of the `AsyncFeatureMap` class into a JSON object, which can be used for various purposes such as storing and transmitting data. 

Example usage:

```scala
val asyncFeatureMap = new AsyncFeatureMap()
// add features to asyncFeatureMap

val serializer = new AsyncFeatureMapSerializer()
val jsonGenerator = new JsonFactory().createGenerator(new StringWriter())
val serializerProvider = new DefaultSerializerProvider.Impl()

serializer.serialize(asyncFeatureMap, jsonGenerator, serializerProvider)

val jsonString = jsonGenerator.getOutputTarget().toString()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a serializer for an AsyncFeatureMap object, which provides a summary of the features that will be ready at which steps and which feature hydrators are responsible for those features.
2. What is the performance impact of changes to the serialization logic?
   - Changes to the serialization logic can have serious performance implications given how hot the serialization path is, so it is recommended to benchmark changes with the AsyncQueryFeatureMapSerializationBenchmark.
3. What is the expected format of the serialized output?
   - The serialized output is expected to be a JSON object with each step identifier as a key and an array of features from the corresponding feature hydrator as the value.
