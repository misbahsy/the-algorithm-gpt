The code defines a case class called `MixerPipelineResult` that extends `PipelineResult`. The purpose of this class is to hold the results of a pipeline that mixes different products. The class includes various optional fields that hold the results of different stages of the pipeline, such as `qualityFactorResult`, `gateResult`, `queryFeatures`, `candidatePipelineResults`, `domainMarshallerResults`, and `transportMarshallerResults`. These fields are all optional because not all stages of the pipeline may be executed or may not produce results. 

The `MixerPipelineResult` class also includes methods to update the result and failure fields, as well as a `resultSize` field that calculates the size of the result based on the selected candidates. 

The `MixerPipelineResult` class is likely used in the larger project to represent the output of the product mixing pipeline. Other parts of the project may use this class to access the results of the pipeline and perform further processing or analysis. For example, the project may use the `resultSize` field to determine the size of the final mixed product and make decisions based on that information. 

The code also includes an `empty` method in the `MixerPipelineResult` companion object that returns an empty `MixerPipelineResult` instance with all optional fields set to `None`. This method may be used to initialize a new `MixerPipelineResult` instance before executing the pipeline. 

Overall, this code defines a data structure that holds the results of a product mixing pipeline and provides methods to update and access those results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MixerPipelineResult` class and what does it contain?
- The `MixerPipelineResult` class is used to store the results of a pipeline execution, including intermediate results and execution details. It contains various optional fields such as `qualityFactorResult`, `gateResult`, `queryFeatures`, `candidatePipelineResults`, etc.

2. What is the significance of the `resultSize` property in the `MixerPipelineResult` class?
- The `resultSize` property is used to calculate the size of the pipeline result based on the selected candidates from the `resultSelectorResults`. It excludes cursors built during marshalling.

3. What is the purpose of the `empty` method in the `MixerPipelineResult` companion object?
- The `empty` method is used to create an empty `MixerPipelineResult` instance with all optional fields set to `None`. This can be useful as a default value or for initializing a new instance.
