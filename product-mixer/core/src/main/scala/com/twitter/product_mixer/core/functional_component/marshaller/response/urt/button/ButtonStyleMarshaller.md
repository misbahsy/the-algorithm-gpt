The `ButtonStyleMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `ButtonStyle` object from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.button` package into a `urt.ButtonStyle` object from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package. This conversion is necessary because the `urt.ButtonStyle` object is used in the rendering of timelines in Twitter's UI.

The `ButtonStyle` object represents the style of a button in the UI, and there are eight possible styles: `Default`, `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Text`, `Destructive`, `Neutral`, `DestructiveSecondary`, and `DestructiveText`. The `apply` method of the `ButtonStyleMarshaller` class takes a `ButtonStyle` object as input and returns the corresponding `urt.ButtonStyle` object. This is achieved using a pattern matching construct that matches the input `ButtonStyle` object to one of the eight possible styles and returns the corresponding `urt.ButtonStyle` object.

This class is likely used in the larger project to ensure consistency in the rendering of buttons across different parts of the UI. For example, if a button is styled as `Primary` in one part of the UI, it should be styled the same way in all other parts of the UI. By using the `ButtonStyleMarshaller` class to convert `ButtonStyle` objects to `urt.ButtonStyle` objects, the rendering of buttons can be standardized across the entire project.

Example usage:

```
val buttonStyle: ButtonStyle = Primary
val buttonStyleMarshaller = new ButtonStyleMarshaller()
val urtButtonStyle: urt.ButtonStyle = buttonStyleMarshaller(buttonStyle)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a ButtonStyleMarshaller class that maps a ButtonStyle enum from the project's model to a corresponding thriftscala ButtonStyle. It is likely used in the process of marshalling data for responses.
2. What are the possible values of the ButtonStyle enum and how do they correspond to the thriftscala ButtonStyle?
- The possible values of the ButtonStyle enum are Default, Primary, Secondary, Text, Destructive, Neutral, DestructiveSecondary, and DestructiveText. They correspond to the thriftscala ButtonStyle values with the same names.
3. What is the purpose of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations on the class?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of the ButtonStyleMarshaller class should be created and used throughout the project. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected into other classes that depend on it.
