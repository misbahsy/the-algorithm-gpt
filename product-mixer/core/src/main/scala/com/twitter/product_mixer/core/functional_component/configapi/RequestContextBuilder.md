The `RequestContextBuilder` class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to build `RequestContext` objects. These objects are used by the config API to determine the parameter overrides to apply to the request. The parameter overrides are determined per request by configs which specify which feature switches, deciders, and AB tests translate to what parameter overrides.

The `RequestContextBuilder` class is a singleton class that takes a `FeatureSwitches` object as a constructor parameter. It has a public method `build` that takes a `ClientContext`, a `Product`, a `Map` of feature overrides, and a `Map` of custom fields for feature switches. The method returns a `RequestContext` object that contains the `userId`, `guestId`, and `featureContext`.

The `getFeatureContext` method is a private method that takes a `ClientContext`, a `Product`, a `Map` of feature overrides, and a `Map` of custom fields for feature switches. It returns a `FeatureContext` object that is used to determine the parameter overrides to apply to the request. The method first calls the `getFeatureSwitchRecipient` method to get a `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object. It then calls the `matchRecipient` method on the `FeatureSwitches` object to get the feature switch results. Finally, it creates an `OrElseFeatureContext` object that combines the forced feature context and the feature switch results feature context.

The `getFeatureSwitchRecipient` method is a private method that takes a `ClientContext` object and returns a `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object. The `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object contains information about the user, device, and application that is used to determine the feature switch results.

Overall, the `RequestContextBuilder` class is an important component of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project that is used to build `RequestContext` objects that are used by the config API to determine the parameter overrides to apply to the request. The class provides methods to get the feature switch recipient and the feature context, which are used to determine the feature switch results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used within the larger project?
- This code is a `RequestContextBuilder` class used to build `RequestContext` objects for the config API. It is used to determine parameter overrides for requests based on feature switches, deciders, and AB tests.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including `FeatureSwitches`, `UserAgent`, `Recipient`, `ClientContext`, `Product`, `FeatureSwitchResultsFeatureContext`, `FeatureContext`, `FeatureValue`, `ForcedFeatureContext`, and `OrElseFeatureContext`.
3. What is the purpose of the `fsCustomMapInput` parameter in the `build` method?
- The `fsCustomMapInput` parameter allows for custom fields to be set on feature switches, but it is not directly supported by product mixer yet and may require future cleanup work.
