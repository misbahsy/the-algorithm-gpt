[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/functional_component/common/alert/ThroughputAlert.scala)

The code defines a case class called `ThroughputAlert` that is used to trigger alerts when the requests per second for a component is outside of a set predicate for a configured amount of time. The class takes in four parameters: `notificationGroup`, `warnPredicate`, `criticalPredicate`, and `runbookLink`. 

The `notificationGroup` parameter specifies the group that should be notified when the alert is triggered. The `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` parameters are instances of the `ThroughputPredicate` class, which is used to set the thresholds for when the alert should be triggered. The `runbookLink` parameter is an optional parameter that specifies a link to a runbook that can be used to resolve the issue that triggered the alert.

The `ThroughputAlert` class extends the `Alert` class and implements the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait. The `Alert` class provides a base implementation for alerts, while the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait is used to indicate that the alert can be observed from Strato, which is a monitoring and alerting system used by Twitter.

The `ThroughputAlert` class also overrides the `alertType` property to set it to `Throughput`, which is an enumeration that represents the type of alert. Additionally, the class includes two `require` statements that ensure that the thresholds for the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` parameters are greater than or equal to zero.

Overall, this code is used to define a specific type of alert that can be triggered when the requests per second for a component is outside of a set threshold. This alert can be observed from Strato and can be configured with a notification group and a runbook link. This code is likely part of a larger project that includes monitoring and alerting functionality for Twitter's services. 

Example usage:

```scala
val notificationGroup = NotificationGroup("my-group")
val warnPredicate = ThroughputPredicate(100)
val criticalPredicate = ThroughputPredicate(50)
val runbookLink = Some("https://my-runbook.com")

val throughputAlert = ThroughputAlert(notificationGroup, warnPredicate, criticalPredicate, runbookLink)

// Trigger the alert if requests per second is below 50 for 5 minutes
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ThroughputAlert` class?
- The `ThroughputAlert` class is used to trigger an alert when the requests/sec for a component is outside of the predicate set by a `ThroughputPredicate` for a configured amount of time.

2. What other classes or components are used in this code?
- The code imports `ThroughputPredicate` from `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert.predicate` and extends `Alert` and `IsObservableFromStrato`.

3. What are the requirements for the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds?
- The `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds must be greater than or equal to 0, as indicated by the `require` statements in the code.
