[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/model/marshalling/request/DebugParams.scala)

The code defines a case class called DebugParams that is used for marshalling requests in the Product Mixer core model. The DebugParams class takes in two optional parameters: featureOverrides and debugOptions. 

The featureOverrides parameter is an optional map of String keys to ConfigApiFeatureValue values. This parameter is used to override feature values in the configuration API. The ConfigApiFeatureValue is a custom data type that represents a feature value in the configuration API. 

The debugOptions parameter is an optional DebugOptions object. The DebugOptions object contains various debugging options that can be used to debug the Product Mixer core model. 

The DebugParams class extends the HasDebugOptions trait, which defines a debugOptions parameter. This trait is used to ensure that all classes that require debugging options have a debugOptions parameter. 

Overall, this code is used to define a data structure that is used to pass debugging options and feature overrides to the Product Mixer core model. This data structure is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods to create and execute requests in the larger project. 

Example usage:

// Create a DebugParams object with feature overrides and debug options
val debugParams = DebugParams(
  Some(Map("feature1" -> ConfigApiFeatureValue("value1"))),
  Some(DebugOptions(true, true))
)

// Use the debugParams object in a request to the Product Mixer core model
val response = productMixerCoreModel.executeRequest(debugParams)
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DebugParams` case class?
- The `DebugParams` case class is used for marshalling request data and contains optional feature overrides and debug options.

2. What is the `HasDebugOptions` trait and how is it related to `DebugParams`?
- The `HasDebugOptions` trait is likely a parent trait that `DebugParams` extends, and it likely defines the `debugOptions` field that `DebugParams` overrides.

3. What is the `ConfigApiFeatureValue` class and where is it imported from?
- The `ConfigApiFeatureValue` class is likely a class used for feature values in the Twitter Timelines Config API, and it is imported from the `com.twitter.timelines.configapi` package.
