The `CursorDisplayTreatmentMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling (converting) a `CursorDisplayTreatment` object into a `urt.CursorDisplayTreatment` object. 

The `CursorDisplayTreatment` object is a model object that contains two fields: `actionText` and `labelText`. These fields represent the text that should be displayed for a particular cursor display treatment. 

The `urt.CursorDisplayTreatment` object is a Thrift-generated object that represents the same data as the `CursorDisplayTreatment` object, but in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized. 

The `apply` method of the `CursorDisplayTreatmentMarshaller` class takes a `CursorDisplayTreatment` object as input and returns a `urt.CursorDisplayTreatment` object. The method simply maps the fields of the input object to the corresponding fields of the output object. 

This class may be used in the larger project to convert `CursorDisplayTreatment` objects into `urt.CursorDisplayTreatment` objects for serialization and deserialization purposes. For example, if the project needs to send a `CursorDisplayTreatment` object over the network, it can use this class to convert the object into a format that can be easily transmitted. 

Example usage:

```scala
val treatment = CursorDisplayTreatment(actionText = "Next Page", labelText = "Page 2")
val marshaller = new CursorDisplayTreatmentMarshaller()
val urtTreatment = marshaller(treatment)
// urtTreatment is now a urt.CursorDisplayTreatment object with actionText = "Next Page" and labelText = "Page 2"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for CursorDisplayTreatment objects in the response of a product mixer core model. It converts the treatment object into a thriftscala CursorDisplayTreatment object.

2. What other dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.operation.CursorDisplayTreatment and the javax.inject libraries.

3. Why is the CursorDisplayTreatmentMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected by a dependency injection framework.
