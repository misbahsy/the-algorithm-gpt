The code defines a case class called `PredicateConfig` and an object with the same name. The `PredicateConfig` case class is used to represent a `Predicate` used for dashboard generation. The case class has five fields: `operator`, `threshold`, `datapointsPastThreshold`, `duration`, and `metricGranularity`. These fields represent the operator used in the predicate, the threshold value, the number of datapoints past the threshold, the duration of the predicate, and the metric granularity respectively.

The `PredicateConfig` object has a single method called `apply` that takes a `Predicate` object as an argument and returns a `PredicateConfig` object. The `apply` method extracts the relevant fields from the `Predicate` object and uses them to create a new `PredicateConfig` object.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves generating dashboards based on data from various sources. The `PredicateConfig` class is used to represent the criteria used to filter and aggregate data for display on the dashboard. The `apply` method in the `PredicateConfig` object is used to convert a `Predicate` object into a `PredicateConfig` object, which can then be used to generate the dashboard.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.controllers.PredicateConfig
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert.predicate.Predicate

val predicate = Predicate(">", 10.0, 5, 60, "seconds")
val predicateConfig = PredicateConfig(predicate)

// predicateConfig is now a PredicateConfig object with the following fields:
// operator = ">"
// threshold = 10.0
// datapointsPastThreshold = 5
// duration = 60
// metricGranularity = "seconds"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Predicate` class and how is it used in this code?
- The smart developer might ask what the `Predicate` class does and how it is related to the `PredicateConfig` class. They might also want to know how the `Predicate` class is used to create an instance of `PredicateConfig`.

2. What is the significance of the `private[core]` access modifier used in the `PredicateConfig` class?
- The smart developer might ask about the significance of the `private[core]` access modifier used in the `PredicateConfig` class. They might want to know why this modifier was used and what it means for the visibility of the class.

3. What is the purpose of the `apply` method in the `PredicateConfig` object?
- The smart developer might ask about the purpose of the `apply` method in the `PredicateConfig` object. They might want to know why this method was defined and how it is used to create an instance of `PredicateConfig`.
