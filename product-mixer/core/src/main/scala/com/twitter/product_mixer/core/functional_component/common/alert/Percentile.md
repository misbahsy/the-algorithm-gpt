[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/functional_component/common/alert/Percentile.scala)

The code defines a sealed trait called `Percentile` and several case objects that extend it. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to monitor specific metrics, such as latency, by recording various percentiles. 

Each case object represents a specific percentile and has a `metricSuffix` property that is used to record the metric. For example, the `Min` case object has a `metricSuffix` of ".min", which would be used to record the minimum value of the metric. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to monitor and analyze performance metrics. By defining specific percentiles to monitor, the project can gain insight into how the system is performing and identify areas for improvement. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in practice:

```
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert._

val latencyMin = Min.metricSuffix // returns ".min"
val latencyP95 = P95.metricSuffix // returns ".p95"
```

In this example, we import the `Percentile` trait and its case objects. We then use the `metricSuffix` property of the `Min` and `P95` case objects to get the suffixes that would be used to record the minimum and 95th percentile values of a latency metric, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a sealed trait and several case objects that represent different percentiles of a specific metric that should be monitored.

2. What is the significance of the metricSuffix property?
- The metricSuffix property is a string that represents the specific percentile of the metric that should be monitored. It is used to record stats using the Finagle Stats library.

3. How might this code be used in a larger project?
- This code could be used to define and monitor different percentiles of a metric in a larger project. It could be used to track performance or other metrics and trigger alerts or other actions based on specific percentile thresholds.
