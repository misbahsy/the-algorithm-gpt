This code defines a set of classes and traits related to media entities in the context of the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent different types of media entities and their associated metadata in a structured way.

The `MediaEntity` trait is a sealed trait, which means that all of its implementations must be defined in the same file. This trait serves as a common interface for all media entities, allowing them to be treated uniformly in certain parts of the codebase.

The `TweetMedia` class represents media associated with a tweet, and includes the ID of the tweet as well as an optional ID for the moment that the tweet was part of. This class is useful for associating media with specific tweets and moments within the larger Twitter ecosystem.

The `BroadcastId` class represents media associated with a broadcast, and includes a string ID for the broadcast. This class is useful for associating media with specific broadcasts within the larger Twitter ecosystem.

The `Image` class represents an image media entity, and includes an `ImageVariant` object that contains metadata about the image, such as its URL and dimensions. This class is useful for representing images in a structured way that can be easily manipulated by other parts of the codebase.

Overall, this code provides a way to represent different types of media entities and their associated metadata in a structured way, allowing them to be easily manipulated and processed by other parts of the larger project. For example, this code could be used in conjunction with other code that retrieves media entities from the Twitter API, allowing those entities to be processed and analyzed in a more structured way. 

Example usage:

```
val tweetMedia = TweetMedia(123456789, Some(987654321))
val broadcastMedia = BroadcastId("abc123")
val image = Image(ImageVariant("https://example.com/image.jpg", 800, 600))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MediaEntity` trait and how is it used in the code?
   - The `MediaEntity` trait is a sealed trait that defines a common interface for different types of media entities. It is used as a base type for the `TweetMedia`, `BroadcastId`, and `Image` case classes.

2. What is the significance of the `sealed` keyword in the `MediaEntity` trait?
   - The `sealed` keyword restricts the inheritance of the `MediaEntity` trait to only the classes defined in the same file. This allows for exhaustive pattern matching on `MediaEntity` instances, ensuring that all possible cases are handled.

3. What is the purpose of the `ImageVariant` class and how is it used in the `Image` case class?
   - The `ImageVariant` class is used to represent different variants of an image, such as different sizes or formats. It is used as a parameter to the `Image` case class to specify the image variant associated with the media entity.
