This code defines a sealed trait called `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` and a case class called `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput`. The purpose of this code is to provide different kinds of follow-up options after a user provides positive or negative feedback on a prompt button. 

The `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` trait is sealed, which means that all of its implementations must be declared in the same file. This is useful for ensuring that all possible implementations are known and handled in a pattern match. 

The `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput` case class takes in three parameters: `context`, `textFieldPlaceholder`, and `sendTextCallback`. `context` is a string that provides additional context for the follow-up prompt. `textFieldPlaceholder` is a string that provides placeholder text for the text input field. `sendTextCallback` is an instance of the `Callback` class, which is defined elsewhere in the project. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to provide a way for users to provide feedback on prompts and then give additional information or context through a text input field. The `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` trait could potentially have other implementations besides `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput`, which would provide different follow-up options. 

Example usage of this code could look like:

```
val followUp = RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput(
  "Please provide additional feedback",
  "Enter your feedback here",
  Callback("https://example.com/send-feedback")
)

// Use the follow-up object to prompt the user for additional feedback
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a sealed trait and a case class for different kinds of follow-ups after a positive-negative feedback on a prompt button.

2. What is the significance of the Callback import?
- The Callback import is used in the RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput case class to define the sendTextCallback property.

3. Are there any other classes or traits that extend RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType?
- It is not shown in this code snippet, but there may be other classes or traits that extend RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType as it is a sealed trait.
