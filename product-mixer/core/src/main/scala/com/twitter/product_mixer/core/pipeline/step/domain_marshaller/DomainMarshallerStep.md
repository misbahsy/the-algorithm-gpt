The `DomainMarshallerStep` class is a step in a pipeline that takes a list of candidates and a domain marshaller, executes the marshaller, and returns a marshalled result. The purpose of this step is to convert the input data into a format that can be used by downstream steps in the pipeline. 

The class takes three type parameters: `Query`, `ResponseType`, and `State`. `Query` represents the domain model for the pipeline query, `ResponseType` represents the domain marshalling type expected to be returned, and `State` represents the pipeline state domain model. 

The class implements the `Step` trait, which defines methods for checking if the step is empty, adapting the input data to the format expected by the marshaller executor, and updating the pipeline state with the executor result. 

The `DomainMarshallerStep` class uses an instance of `DomainMarshallerExecutor` to execute the domain marshaller. The `DomainMarshallerExecutor` is responsible for taking the input data and returning the marshalled result. 

Here is an example of how the `DomainMarshallerStep` class might be used in a pipeline:

```
val marshaller = new DomainMarshaller[Query, ResponseType]
val step = DomainMarshallerStep(marshaller)
val pipeline = Pipeline(step, ...)
val result = pipeline.execute(input)
```

In this example, `marshaller` is an instance of the `DomainMarshaller` class, which defines how to convert the input data into the desired output format. `step` is an instance of the `DomainMarshallerStep` class, which takes the `marshaller` instance and uses it to execute the marshalling process. `pipeline` is an instance of the `Pipeline` class, which defines the steps in the pipeline and how they are executed. `result` is the output of the pipeline, which is the marshalled data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a domain marshaller step in the product mixer core pipeline. It takes a list of candidates and a domain marshaller, executes it, and returns a marshalled result. It is part of a larger project that likely involves processing and manipulating product data.

2. What are the input and output types for this step? 
- The input types are a PipelineQuery domain model and a HasCandidatesWithDetails domain model, while the output type is a marshalled domain model specified by the ResponseType type parameter.

3. What is the role of the DomainMarshallerExecutor and how is it used in this code? 
- The DomainMarshallerExecutor is responsible for executing the domain marshaller specified in the input and returning a result. It is used in the arrow method to create an Arrow that takes inputs of type DomainMarshallerExecutor.Inputs[Query] and returns results of type DomainMarshallerExecutor.Result[ResponseType].
