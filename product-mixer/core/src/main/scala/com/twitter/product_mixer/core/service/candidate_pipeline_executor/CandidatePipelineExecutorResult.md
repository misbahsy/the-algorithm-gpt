The code defines a case class called CandidatePipelineExecutorResult, which is used to store the results of executing a candidate pipeline. A candidate pipeline is a series of steps that are used to generate a set of candidate products that match a user's query. 

The CandidatePipelineExecutorResult class has two fields: candidatePipelineResults and queryFeatureMap. The candidatePipelineResults field is a sequence of CandidatePipelineResult objects, which represent the results of each step in the candidate pipeline. The queryFeatureMap field is a FeatureMap object that represents the features of the user's query.

This class is likely used in the larger project to store the results of executing candidate pipelines for various user queries. For example, if a user searches for "running shoes", the candidate pipeline would generate a set of candidate products that match that query. The results of that pipeline would be stored in a CandidatePipelineExecutorResult object, which could then be used to display the candidate products to the user.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in code:

```
val pipelineResults = Seq(
  CandidatePipelineResult(Seq("product1", "product2"), 0.8),
  CandidatePipelineResult(Seq("product3", "product4"), 0.6)
)
val queryFeatures = FeatureMap(Map("color" -> "blue", "size" -> "10"))

val executorResult = CandidatePipelineExecutorResult(pipelineResults, queryFeatures)

// Use the executorResult object to display candidate products to the user
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the CandidatePipelineExecutorResult class?
   - The CandidatePipelineExecutorResult class is used to store the results of executing a candidate pipeline and the corresponding query feature map.

2. What is the significance of the Seq[CandidatePipelineResult] and FeatureMap types?
   - The Seq[CandidatePipelineResult] type represents a sequence of results from executing a candidate pipeline, while the FeatureMap type represents a mapping of features to their values for a given query.

3. How is the CandidatePipelineExecutorResult class used within the larger context of the project?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet alone how the CandidatePipelineExecutorResult class is used within the larger context of the project. Further investigation into the project's codebase and documentation may be necessary to answer this question.
