[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/functional_component/common/alert/GenericClientLatencyAlert.scala)

The code defines a case class called `GenericClientLatencyAlert` that is used to trigger an alert when the latency for a specified client rises above a certain threshold for a configured amount of time. This class is similar to another class called `LatencyAlert`, but is intended for use with an external client calling Product Mixer.

The `GenericClientLatencyAlert` class takes in several parameters, including the source client, a notification group, and two predicates that determine when to trigger a warning or critical alert. These predicates are instances of the `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` class, which is defined in another package. The `runbookLink` parameter is an optional string that can be used to provide a link to a runbook for handling the alert.

The `GenericClientLatencyAlert` class extends another class called `Alert`, which defines the basic structure of an alert. The `alertType` parameter is set to `Latency`, indicating that this alert is specifically for latency issues.

This code is likely used as part of a larger system for monitoring and managing the performance of Product Mixer. By defining different types of alerts, such as `GenericClientLatencyAlert`, the system can be configured to notify the appropriate parties when certain performance thresholds are exceeded. This can help ensure that issues are identified and addressed in a timely manner, minimizing the impact on users and the business. 

Example usage:

```
val client = new GenericClient("example_client")
val notificationGroup = new NotificationGroup(Seq("admin@example.com"))
val warnPredicate = new TriggerIfLatencyAbove(500)
val criticalPredicate = new TriggerIfLatencyAbove(1000)
val alert = GenericClientLatencyAlert(client, notificationGroup, warnPredicate, criticalPredicate, Some("https://example.com/runbook"))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GenericClientLatencyAlert` class?
   - The `GenericClientLatencyAlert` class is intended for use with an external client calling Product Mixer and triggers when the latency for the specified client rises above the `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` threshold for the configured amount of time.

2. What are the parameters required to create an instance of `GenericClientLatencyAlert`?
   - An instance of `GenericClientLatencyAlert` requires a `GenericClient` object, a `NotificationGroup` object, `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` objects for both warning and critical predicates, and an optional `runbookLink` string.

3. What is the relationship between `GenericClientLatencyAlert` and `LatencyAlert`?
   - `GenericClientLatencyAlert` is similar to `LatencyAlert` but is intended for use with an external client calling Product Mixer, while `LatencyAlert` is not specific to any client. Both classes trigger when the latency rises above a certain threshold for a configured amount of time.
