The `CursorTypeMarshaller` class is responsible for converting between the `CursorType` enumeration used in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.slice` package and the `t.CursorType` enumeration used in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.thriftscala` package. This conversion is necessary because the `CursorType` enumeration is used internally by the product mixer core, while the `t.CursorType` enumeration is used in the Thrift API.

The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It also has an `@Inject` annotation on its constructor, indicating that it can be injected as a dependency into other classes.

The `apply` method takes a `CursorType` parameter and returns the corresponding `t.CursorType` value. It does this using a pattern match on the `CursorType` parameter, returning the appropriate `t.CursorType` value for each case.

The `unmarshall` method takes a `t.CursorType` parameter and returns the corresponding `CursorType` value. It does this using a pattern match on the `t.CursorType` parameter, returning the appropriate `CursorType` value for each case. If an unknown `t.CursorType` value is encountered, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

This class is likely used in the larger project to convert between the `CursorType` enumeration used internally by the product mixer core and the `t.CursorType` enumeration used in the Thrift API. This conversion is necessary to ensure that the API can communicate with the core and that the core can communicate with the API. An example usage of this class might look like:

```
val cursorTypeMarshaller = new CursorTypeMarshaller()

val cursorType = cursorTypeMarshaller.unmarshall(t.CursorType.Next)

val tCursorType = cursorTypeMarshaller(CursorType.Gap)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a CursorTypeMarshaller class that converts between internal and external representations of cursor types. It is likely used in the process of marshalling and unmarshalling responses in the larger project.

2. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.

3. What is the purpose of the UnsupportedOperationException in the unmarshall method?
- The UnsupportedOperationException is thrown when an unrecognized cursor type is encountered during unmarshalling. This is likely to alert developers to a potential issue with the response being processed.
