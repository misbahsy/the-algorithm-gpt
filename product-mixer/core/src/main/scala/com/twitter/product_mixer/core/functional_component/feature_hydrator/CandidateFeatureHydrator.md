This code defines a set of traits and classes for hydrating features for candidates in a product mixer pipeline. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to add features to candidates in a pipeline, which can then be used downstream in other APIs. 

The `BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait is a sealed trait that defines a base feature hydrator for a single candidate. It takes in a query, a result, and a feature type, and extends the `FeatureHydrator` trait and the `SupportsConditionally` trait. The `CandidateFeatureHydrator` trait extends `BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator` and provides an implementation for hydrating a single candidate at a time. It takes in a query and a candidate, and returns a `Stitch` of `FeatureMap`. The `BaseBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait extends `BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator` and provides a way to hydrate features for a list of candidates. It takes in a query and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures`, and returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `FeatureMap`. Finally, the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait extends `BaseBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` and provides an implementation for hydrating features for all candidates at once. 

Overall, this code provides a way to add features to candidates in a product mixer pipeline, which can then be used downstream in other APIs. For example, if the candidate is a tweet, a feature could be whether it's marked as sensitive. This feature can then be used downstream in other APIs to filter out sensitive tweets. 

Example usage:

```scala
// Define a candidate feature hydrator for tweets
object TweetFeatureHydrator extends CandidateFeatureHydrator[TweetQuery, Tweet] {
  override val identifier: FeatureHydratorIdentifier = FeatureHydratorIdentifier("tweet_feature_hydrator")

  override def apply(query: TweetQuery, candidate: Tweet, existingFeatures: FeatureMap): Stitch[FeatureMap] = {
    // Add a feature for whether the tweet is sensitive
    val isSensitive = candidate.isSensitive
    existingFeatures.addFeature("is_sensitive", isSensitive)
  }
}

// Define a bulk candidate feature hydrator for tweets
object BulkTweetFeatureHydrator extends BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator[TweetQuery, Tweet] {
  override val identifier: FeatureHydratorIdentifier = FeatureHydratorIdentifier("bulk_tweet_feature_hydrator")

  override def apply(query: TweetQuery, candidates: Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[Tweet]]): Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]] = {
    // Add a feature for the visibility reason of each tweet
    val visibilityReasons = candidates.map(candidate => candidate.features.addFeature("visibility_reason", candidate.visibilityReason))
    Stitch.sequence(visibilityReasons)
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines traits and classes for hydrating features for candidates in a product mixer pipeline. It solves the problem of efficiently adding features to candidates in a scalable way.

2. What is the difference between CandidateFeatureHydrator and BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator?
- CandidateFeatureHydrator hydrates features for a single candidate at a time, while BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator hydrates features for a list of candidates at once.

3. What is the role of SupportsConditionally and how is it used?
- SupportsConditionally is a trait that allows a feature hydrator to be conditionally run based on a query. It is used as a mixin to BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator to enable conditional gating of feature hydrators.
