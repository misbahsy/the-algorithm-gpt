The `TweetHydrationContextMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling a `TweetHydrationContext` object into a `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` object. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The purpose of this code is to convert a `TweetHydrationContext` object into a `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` object. The `TweetHydrationContext` object contains information about a tweet that is needed for hydration, while the `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` object is a Thrift-generated class that is used to serialize and deserialize data.

The `apply` method takes a `TweetHydrationContext` object as input and returns a `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` object. The `safetyLevelOverride` field of the `TweetHydrationContext` object is mapped to the `safetyLevelOverride` field of the `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` object using the `safetyLevelMarshaller` object. The `outerTweetContext` field of the `TweetHydrationContext` object is mapped to the `outerTweetContext` field of the `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` object using the `outerTweetContextMarshaller` object.

This code is used in the larger project to convert `TweetHydrationContext` objects into `thrift.TweetHydrationContext` objects for serialization and deserialization. This is important for sending and receiving data over the network, as well as storing and retrieving data from a database. 

Example usage:

```
val tweetHydrationContext = TweetHydrationContext(
  safetyLevelOverride = Some(SafetyLevel.High),
  outerTweetContext = Some(OuterTweetContext(...))
)

val marshaller = TweetHydrationContextMarshaller(safetyLevelMarshaller, outerTweetContextMarshaller)
val thriftTweetHydrationContext = marshaller(tweetHydrationContext)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a TweetHydrationContext object. It converts the object into a thrift.TweetHydrationContext object by mapping its safetyLevelOverride and outerTweetContext fields using other marshallers.
   
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the SafetyLevelMarshaller and OuterTweetContextMarshaller classes, as well as the TweetHydrationContext and thriftscala packages from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core and com.twitter.strato.graphql.contextual_refs namespaces, respectively. It also uses the javax.inject package for dependency injection.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply() method?
   - The apply() method takes a TweetHydrationContext object as input and returns a thrift.TweetHydrationContext object as output. The input object's safetyLevelOverride and outerTweetContext fields are mapped to the output object's corresponding fields using the safetyLevelMarshaller and outerTweetContextMarshaller marshallers, respectively.
