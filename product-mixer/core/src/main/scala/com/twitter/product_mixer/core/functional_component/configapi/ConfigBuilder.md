The `ConfigBuilder` class is a part of the functional component of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. It is responsible for building a configuration object that contains parameters for both products and global settings. The configuration object is built using the `ProductParamRegistry` and `GlobalParamRegistry` classes, which are imported at the beginning of the file.

The `ConfigBuilder` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire application. This is useful for ensuring that the configuration object is consistent across all components that use it.

The `ConfigBuilder` class has a single method called `build()`, which returns a `Config` object. The `Config` object is created using the `CompositeConfig` class, which is imported from the `com.twitter.timelines.configapi` package. The `CompositeConfig` class is a composite of multiple `Config` objects, which are passed to it as a sequence of parameters.

The sequence of parameters passed to the `CompositeConfig` constructor is created by concatenating the results of two method calls: `productParamRegistry.build()` and `Seq(globalParamRegistry.build())`. The `productParamRegistry.build()` method returns a sequence of `Config` objects that contain parameters specific to each product. The `globalParamRegistry.build()` method returns a single `Config` object that contains global parameters.

Overall, the `ConfigBuilder` class is an important component of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project, as it provides a way to build a consistent configuration object that can be used across all components of the application. Here is an example of how the `ConfigBuilder` class might be used:

```
val productParamRegistry = new ProductParamRegistry()
val globalParamRegistry = new GlobalParamRegistry()
val configBuilder = new ConfigBuilder(productParamRegistry, globalParamRegistry)
val config = configBuilder.build()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   This code is a ConfigBuilder class that takes in two registries and builds a composite configuration by combining the product parameters and global parameters.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   This code depends on the ProductParamRegistry, GlobalParamRegistry, CompositeConfig, Config, Inject, and Singleton classes.

3. How is this code used in the larger project?
   This code is likely used to generate a configuration object that is used throughout the project to provide settings and parameters for various components.
