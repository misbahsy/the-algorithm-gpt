The `ClientEventInfoMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `ClientEventInfo` objects into `urt.ClientEventInfo` objects. This class is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and analyzing data related to client events.

The `ClientEventInfo` class represents information about a client event, such as the component and element involved, the action taken, and any associated details. The `urt.ClientEventInfo` class is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same information in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized.

The `apply` method of the `ClientEventInfoMarshaller` class takes a `ClientEventInfo` object as input and returns a `urt.ClientEventInfo` object. The method uses the `clientEventDetailsMarshaller` object to marshal any associated details into `urt.ClientEventDetails` objects before adding them to the `urt.ClientEventInfo` object.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val clientEventInfo = ClientEventInfo(
  component = "button",
  element = "submit",
  details = Some(Map("label" -> "Save")),
  action = "click",
  entityToken = Some("abc123")
)

val clientEventInfoMarshaller = new ClientEventInfoMarshaller(new ClientEventDetailsMarshaller())

val urtClientEventInfo = clientEventInfoMarshaller(clientEventInfo)
```

In this example, a `ClientEventInfo` object is created with information about a button click event. The `ClientEventInfoMarshaller` object is then used to marshal this object into a `urt.ClientEventInfo` object. This `urt.ClientEventInfo` object can then be serialized and sent to another part of the system for further processing or analysis.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for converting `ClientEventInfo` objects to `urt.ClientEventInfo` objects. It maps the properties of the input object to the corresponding properties of the output object.
2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they injected?
   - This code depends on `ClientEventDetailsMarshaller` and it is injected through the constructor using the `@Inject` annotation. It also uses the `javax.inject.Singleton` annotation to ensure that only one instance of this class is created.
3. What is the relationship between `urt.ClientEventInfo` and `ClientEventInfo`?
   - `urt.ClientEventInfo` is a Thrift-generated class that represents a specific data structure used in the project. `ClientEventInfo` is a custom class that contains similar data but is used in a different part of the project. This marshaller is used to convert between the two formats.
