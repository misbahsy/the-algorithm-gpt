The code defines a sealed abstract class called `SelectorIdentifier` that extends another class called `ComponentIdentifier`. The purpose of this class is to provide an identifier for selectors used in the `SelectorExecutor` class. The `SelectorIdentifier` class is effectively final, meaning it cannot be extended by other classes. The class takes a `name` parameter and passes it to the `ComponentIdentifier` constructor along with the string `"Selector"`. 

The `SelectorIdentifier` class overrides two methods from its parent class: `canEqual` and `equals`. The `canEqual` method checks if the passed object is an instance of `SelectorIdentifier`. The `equals` method provides a high-performance implementation of the equality check between two `SelectorIdentifier` objects. It first checks if the two objects are the same reference, then checks if their hashcodes are equal, and finally checks if their component types and names are equal. 

The `SelectorIdentifier` class also overrides the `hashCode` method to provide a cached hashcode value. The hashcode is calculated using the `##` method on the `componentType` and `name` fields. The `##` method is used instead of `hashCode()` to ensure consistency with object equality. 

The code also defines a companion object for `SelectorIdentifier` that provides a factory method called `apply`. This method takes a `name` string and an `index` integer and returns a new `SelectorIdentifier` object. The `name` string is capitalized and any special characters are removed. The `index` integer is converted to a string and concatenated with the capitalized `name` to form the identifier's name. 

Overall, this code provides a way to create unique identifiers for selectors used in the `SelectorExecutor` class. The `SelectorIdentifier` class ensures that these identifiers are effectively final and provides a high-performance implementation of equality and hashcode checks. The `SelectorIdentifier` companion object provides a convenient way to create new identifiers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the SelectorIdentifier class and how is it used in the project?
- The SelectorIdentifier class is used to identify selectors in the ComponentIdentifierStack in the SelectorExecutor. It is a sealed abstract class that extends ComponentIdentifier and has a high-performance implementation of the equals method.
2. What is the purpose of the hashCode method and why is it cached as a val?
- The hashCode method is used to compute the hash code of the SelectorIdentifier object. It is cached as a val to prevent the need to recompute the hashCode on each hashCode() invocation, which is the behavior of the Scala compiler case class-generated hashCode().
3. Why is the SelectorIdentifier class effectively final and what is the implication of this?
- The SelectorIdentifier class is effectively final because its equals method is designed to handle class inheritor equality. The implication of this is that any attempt to inherit from the SelectorIdentifier class will break the equals method and cause unexpected behavior.
