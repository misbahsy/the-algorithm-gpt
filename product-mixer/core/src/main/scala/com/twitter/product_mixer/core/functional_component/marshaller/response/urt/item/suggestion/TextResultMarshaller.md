The `TextResultMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting a `TextResult` object into a `urt.TextResult` object. The `TextResult` object contains information about a text result, such as the text itself, any hit highlights, the score, and the query source. The `urt.TextResult` object is a Thrift-generated class that is used to represent a text result in the context of the larger project.

The `TextResultMarshaller` class has a single method called `apply` that takes a `TextResult` object as input and returns a `urt.TextResult` object. The method first extracts the hit highlights from the `TextResult` object and converts them into a sequence of `HighlightedSection` objects using the `highlightedSectionMarshaller` object. The `highlightedSectionMarshaller` object is an instance of the `HighlightedSectionMarshaller` class, which is responsible for converting a `HighlightedSection` object into a `urt.HighlightedSection` object.

Once the hit highlights have been converted into a sequence of `urt.HighlightedSection` objects, the `apply` method creates a new `urt.TextResult` object using the information from the `TextResult` object and the converted hit highlights. The `urt.TextResult` object is then returned.

This class is used in the larger project to convert `TextResult` objects into `urt.TextResult` objects, which are used to represent text results in the context of the project. This conversion is necessary because the `TextResult` object is specific to this project, while the `urt.TextResult` object is a Thrift-generated class that is used throughout the project. An example of how this class might be used in the larger project is shown below:

```
val textResult = TextResult("example text", Seq(HighlightedSection("example highlight")), 0.5, "example query")
val textResultMarshaller = TextResultMarshaller(new HighlightedSectionMarshaller())
val urtTextResult = textResultMarshaller(textResult)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a `TextResult` object, which is used to convert it into a `urt.TextResult` object. The marshaller uses a `HighlightedSectionMarshaller` object to convert the `hitHighlights` field of the `TextResult` object into a sequence of `HighlightedSection` objects.
   
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including `HighlightedSectionMarshaller`, `HighlightedSection`, `TextResult`, and `urt.TextResult`. It also imports several packages and uses annotations to indicate that the class is a singleton and should be injected with dependencies.
   
3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
   - The `apply` method expects a `TextResult` object as input and returns a `urt.TextResult` object as output. The `TextResult` object should have a `text` field, a `hitHighlights` field that is a sequence of sequences of `HighlightedSection` objects, a `score` field, and a `querySource` field. The `urt.TextResult` object has the same fields, but the `hitHighlights` field is a sequence of sequences of strings instead of `HighlightedSection` objects.
