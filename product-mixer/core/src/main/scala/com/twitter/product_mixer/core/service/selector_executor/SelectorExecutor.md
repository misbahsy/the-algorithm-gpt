The `SelectorExecutor` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for applying a sequence of `Selector`s in sequential order. It returns the results and a detailed list of each selector's results for debugging and understandability. 

The `arrow` method takes a sequence of `Selector`s and an `Executor.Context` as input and returns an `Arrow` that takes `SelectorExecutor.Inputs` as input and returns `SelectorExecutorResult`. The method first checks if the sequence of `Selector`s is empty and throws a `PipelineFailure` if it is. It then creates an `Arrow` that applies each `Selector` in the sequence to the input `Query` and the remaining candidates from the previous `Selector`. The `Arrow` returns a tuple of the `Query` and the `SelectorResult` for each `Selector`. 

The `Arrow` then maps over the tuple to get the last `SelectorResult` and the remaining candidates. It then combines the results and remaining candidates and filters out the dropped candidates. Finally, it returns a `SelectorExecutorResult` that contains the selected candidates, remaining candidates, dropped candidates, and individual selector results. 

The `getIndividualSelectorIsoArrow` method takes a `Selector`, an index, and an `Executor.Context` as input and returns an `Arrow.Iso`. The method creates an `Arrow` that applies the `Selector` to the input `Query` and the remaining candidates from the previous `Selector`. It then returns a tuple of the `Query` and the `SelectorResult` for the `Selector`. 

Overall, the `SelectorExecutor` class is a useful component of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project that applies a sequence of `Selector`s in sequential order and returns the results and a detailed list of each selector's results. It can be used to select the best candidates from a pool of candidates based on various criteria. 

Example usage:

```scala
val selector1 = new Selector1()
val selector2 = new Selector2()
val selectors = Seq(selector1, selector2)
val context = new Executor.Context()

val query = new PipelineQuery()
val candidatesWithDetails = Seq(new CandidateWithDetails())

val selectorExecutor = new SelectorExecutor(new StatsReceiver())
val arrow = selectorExecutor.arrow(selectors, context)
val inputs = SelectorExecutor.Inputs(query, candidatesWithDetails)
val result = arrow(inputs)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a SelectorExecutor class that applies a sequence of Selector objects to a PipelineQuery object in sequential order and returns the results. It is part of the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.service package and is used to execute selectors in the product mixer pipeline.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `arrow` method?
- The `arrow` method takes in a sequence of Selector objects and an Executor.Context object, and returns an Arrow object that maps SelectorExecutor.Inputs to SelectorExecutorResult.

3. What is the purpose of the `wrapComponentsWithTracingOnly` and `wrapWithErrorHandling` methods?
- These methods are used to wrap the Arrow object returned by `getIndividualSelectorIsoArrow` with additional functionality for tracing and error handling. They are used to ensure that the pipeline is executed correctly and any errors are handled appropriately.
