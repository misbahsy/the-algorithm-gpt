The `FuturePools` object in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.util` package provides utility methods for creating `FuturePool` instances with finite thread counts and different work queue options. A `FuturePool` is a thread pool that is used to execute `Future` computations. 

The `FuturePools` object provides three methods for creating `FuturePool` instances: `boundedFixedThreadPool`, `unboundedFixedThreadPool`, and `futurePool`. 

The `boundedFixedThreadPool` method creates a `FuturePool` with a fixed number of threads and a work queue with a maximum size of `maxWorkQueueSize`. If the work queue is full, the `FuturePool` returns a failed `Future` containing a `RejectedExecutionException`. 

The `unboundedFixedThreadPool` method creates a `FuturePool` with a fixed number of threads and an unbounded work queue. Since the work queue is unbounded, this method can fill up memory if the available worker threads can't keep up. 

The `futurePool` method creates a `FuturePool` with the provided thread configuration and whose `workQueue` is monitored by a `Gauge`. If `minThreads` is equal to `maxThreads`, then the thread pool has a fixed size. The `keepIdleThreadsAlive` parameter specifies how long idle threads should be kept alive before being removed from the pool if there are more than `minThreads` in the pool. If the pool size is fixed, this parameter is ignored. 

All three methods return a `FuturePool` instance that can be used to execute `Future` computations. 

Here is an example of how to use the `boundedFixedThreadPool` method to create a `FuturePool` with four threads and a work queue with a maximum size of 100:

```scala
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.util.FuturePools

val futurePool = FuturePools.boundedFixedThreadPool(
  name = "my-future-pool",
  fixedThreadCount = 4,
  workQueueSize = 100,
  statsReceiver = myStatsReceiver
)

val myFuture = futurePool {
  // some computation that returns a Future
}
```

In this example, `myFuture` is a `Future` that will be executed by the `futurePool` instance created by the `boundedFixedThreadPool` method. If the work queue is full, the `Future` will fail with a `RejectedExecutionException`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility for making FuturePool with finite thread counts and different work queue options while also monitoring the size of the work queue that's used.

2. What are the differences between `boundedFixedThreadPool` and `unboundedFixedThreadPool`?
- `boundedFixedThreadPool` makes a FuturePool with a fixed number of threads and a work queue with a maximum size of `maxWorkQueueSize`, while `unboundedFixedThreadPool` makes a FuturePool with a fix number of threads and an unbounded work queue.

3. What is the purpose of the `statsReceiver` parameter?
- The `statsReceiver` parameter is used to monitor the size of the work queue that's used by the FuturePool. It is also used to monitor the thread configuration of the FuturePool.
