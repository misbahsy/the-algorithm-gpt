The code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a specific type of response in the context of the larger project called "The Algorithm from Twitter". The purpose of this code is to convert an internal representation of a relevance prompt follow-up feedback type into a Thrift-serialized format that can be sent over the wire. 

The class takes an instance of `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInputMarshaller` as an injected dependency, which is used to convert the `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput` object into a Thrift-serialized format. The `apply` method of the class takes an instance of `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` as input and returns a Thrift-serialized representation of the object. 

The `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` is an abstract class that represents different types of follow-up feedback that can be given in response to a relevance prompt. The specific type of follow-up feedback is determined by the subclass of `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` that is passed to the `apply` method. In this case, the code handles the case where the follow-up feedback is a text input, represented by the `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput` subclass. 

The returned Thrift-serialized object is an instance of `urt.RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType`, which is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same type of follow-up feedback as the input object. The Thrift-serialized object is used to communicate the follow-up feedback to other components of the larger project.

Example usage of this code would involve creating an instance of `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` with a specific subclass, such as `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput`, and passing it to the `apply` method of an instance of `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackTypeMarshaller`. The returned Thrift-serialized object could then be sent over the wire to other components of the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a specific type of response item called `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType`. It converts this item into a corresponding Thrift object.
2. What other dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on two other classes: `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInputMarshaller` and `urt.RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType`. The former is used to convert a `RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput` object into a Thrift object, while the latter is the Thrift object that this marshaller produces.
3. Why is the `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` object being matched against a specific subtype (`RelevancePromptFollowUpTextInput`)?
   - It is possible that there are other subtypes of `RelevancePromptFollowUpFeedbackType` that require different handling. By matching against a specific subtype, this code can ensure that the correct marshaller is used for that subtype.
