The `ForwardPivotMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `ForwardPivot` object into a `urt.ForwardPivot` object, which is used in the larger project to render a forward pivot item in a timeline. 

The class takes in several dependencies in its constructor, including `UrlMarshaller`, `RichTextMarshaller`, `ImageVariantMarshaller`, `BadgeMarshaller`, `RosettaColorMarshaller`, and two custom marshallers for `ForwardPivotDisplayType` and `SoftInterventionDisplayType`. These dependencies are used to convert the various fields of the `ForwardPivot` object into the appropriate format for the `urt.ForwardPivot` object.

The `apply` method takes in a `ForwardPivot` object and returns a `urt.ForwardPivot` object. It uses the various marshallers to convert the fields of the `ForwardPivot` object into the appropriate format for the `urt.ForwardPivot` object. For example, the `landingUrl` field is converted using the `UrlMarshaller`, the `text` field is converted using the `RichTextMarshaller`, and so on.

This class is used in the larger project to render forward pivot items in a timeline. A forward pivot item is a type of tweet that includes a link to another tweet or a Twitter Moment. The `urt.ForwardPivot` object is used to render the forward pivot item in the timeline, including the text, link, icon, and other metadata associated with the item.

Example usage:

```
val forwardPivot = ForwardPivot(
  text = "Check out this awesome tweet!",
  landingUrl = "https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789",
  displayType = ForwardPivotDisplayType.Default,
  iconImageVariant = Some(ImageVariant.Small),
  stateBadge = None,
  subtext = None,
  backgroundColorName = Some(RosettaColor.Blue),
  engagementNudge = None,
  softInterventionDisplayType = None
)

val forwardPivotMarshaller = new ForwardPivotMarshaller(
  new UrlMarshaller(),
  new RichTextMarshaller(),
  new ImageVariantMarshaller(),
  new BadgeMarshaller(),
  new RosettaColorMarshaller(),
  new ForwardPivotDisplayTypeMarshaller(),
  new SoftInterventionDisplayTypeMarshaller()
)

val urtForwardPivot = forwardPivotMarshaller(forwardPivot)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   This code is a Scala class that marshals a ForwardPivot object into a Thrift ForwardPivot object. It uses various marshaller classes to convert the fields of the ForwardPivot object into the appropriate Thrift types.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   This code depends on several other classes and packages, including UrlMarshaller, RichTextMarshaller, ForwardPivotDisplayTypeMarshaller, SoftInterventionDisplayTypeMarshaller, ImageVariantMarshaller, BadgeMarshaller, RosettaColorMarshaller, and the urt package from the timelines.render package.

3. What is the purpose of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
   The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that the dependencies of this class should be injected by a dependency injection framework.
