The `ComponentRegistry` class is a part of the Product Mixer framework used to provide information about the components and pipelines that make up an application. The registry is a snapshot of the state of the world when pipelines were last built successfully. The registry is used to configure alerts and dashboards, query application structure, display the graph of the execution, and garner insight into usages. 

The `ComponentRegistry` class has a `get` method that returns a future of the `ComponentRegistrySnapshot`. The `ComponentRegistrySnapshot` class is used to store the registered components, determine the children of a component identifier, and determine the uniqueness of a component identifier within a given component identifier stack. The `register` method of the `ComponentRegistrySnapshot` class is used to register a component at the end of the path provided by `parentIdentifierStack`. The method throws an exception if adding the component results in an invalid configuration. 

The `ComponentRegistry` class has a `set` method that sets the snapshot of the registry. The `snapshotActivity` and `snapshotWitness` variables are used to store the snapshot of the registry. The `snapshotCount` variable is used to count the number of snapshots taken. 

The `ComponentRegistry` class is a singleton class that takes a `StatsReceiver` as a parameter. The `StatsReceiver` is used to receive statistics about the registry.

## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the ComponentRegistry class and how does it work with other classes in the project?
- The ComponentRegistry class is responsible for registering and storing information about the Components and Pipelines that make up an application. It works with the ComponentIdentifier and ProductPipelineRegistry classes to provide information about the application's structure and usage.

2. What exceptions can be thrown when registering a component and what do they indicate?
- Two exceptions can be thrown when registering a component: ChildComponentCollisionException and ComponentIdentifierCollisionException. The former indicates that the same component has been registered multiple times under the same parent, while the latter indicates that a component with the same identifier has been registered but with a different type.

3. How are components stored and organized within the ComponentRegistrySnapshot class?
- Components are stored in a ConcurrentHashMap using their ComponentIdentifier as the key. The class also uses two other ConcurrentHashMaps to keep track of the children of a ComponentIdentifier and the uniqueness of ComponentIdentifiers within a ComponentIdentifierStack.
