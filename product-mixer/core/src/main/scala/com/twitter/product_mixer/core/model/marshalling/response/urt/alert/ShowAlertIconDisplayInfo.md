[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/model/marshalling/response/urt/alert/ShowAlertIconDisplayInfo.scala)

This code defines a case class called `ShowAlertIconDisplayInfo` that is used to represent information about how to display an alert icon. The class has two properties: `icon`, which is of type `ShowAlertIcon`, and `tint`, which is of type `RosettaColor`.

The `ShowAlertIcon` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely used to represent the actual icon image. The `RosettaColor` class is defined in a separate file and is used to represent a color value.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves displaying alerts to users. When an alert needs to be displayed, the code can use an instance of `ShowAlertIconDisplayInfo` to determine which icon to display and what color to use.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.alert.ShowAlertIconDisplayInfo
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.color.RosettaColor

val icon = ShowAlertIcon(...)
val tint = RosettaColor(...)
val displayInfo = ShowAlertIconDisplayInfo(icon, tint)

// Use the displayInfo object to display the alert icon
```

Overall, this code is a small but important piece of a larger system for displaying alerts to users. By defining a standard way to represent information about how to display an alert icon, the code helps ensure consistency and maintainability across the system.
