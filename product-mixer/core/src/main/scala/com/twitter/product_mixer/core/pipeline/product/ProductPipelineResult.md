The `ProductPipelineResult` class is a case class that represents the result of a product pipeline. It contains several optional fields that represent the different stages of the pipeline, including the transformed query, quality factor result, gate result, pipeline selector result, mixer pipeline result, and recommendation pipeline result. It also includes fields for the trace ID, pipeline failure, and final result.

The `ProductPipelineResult` class extends the `PipelineResult` trait, which defines methods for getting the result size, setting a pipeline failure, and setting the final result. The `resultSize` method returns the size of the final result, which is determined by checking whether the mixer pipeline result or recommendation pipeline result is defined and returning the result size of the defined field. The `withFailure` and `withResult` methods return a new `ProductPipelineResult` instance with the specified pipeline failure or final result, respectively.

The `ProductPipelineResult` object provides two factory methods. The `empty` method returns an empty `ProductPipelineResult` instance with all fields set to `None`. The `fromResult` method returns a `ProductPipelineResult` instance with the final result field set to the specified result and all other fields set to `None`.

This class is likely used in the larger project to represent the result of a product pipeline, which may include multiple stages such as quality factor calculation, gating, pipeline selection, and mixing. The `ProductPipelineResult` class provides a convenient way to encapsulate the results of each stage and pass them along to the next stage in the pipeline. The `resultSize` method is useful for determining the size of the final result, which may be important for downstream processing. The factory methods provide a way to create new `ProductPipelineResult` instances with default or specified values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProductPipelineResult` class?
- The `ProductPipelineResult` class is used to represent the result of a product pipeline, which includes information about the transformed query, quality factor result, gate result, pipeline selector result, mixer pipeline result, recommendation pipeline result, trace ID, failure, and final result.

2. What is the difference between `mixerPipelineResult` and `recommendationPipelineResult`?
- `mixerPipelineResult` is an option that contains a `MixerPipelineResult` object, while `recommendationPipelineResult` is an option that contains a `RecommendationPipelineResult` object. The former is used when the pipeline involves mixing multiple products, while the latter is used when the pipeline involves making recommendations based on user preferences.

3. What is the purpose of the `fromResult` method in the `ProductPipelineResult` companion object?
- The `fromResult` method is used to create a `ProductPipelineResult` object with a specified result value, while leaving all other fields as `None`. This is useful when the pipeline only involves a single step and there is no need to populate the other fields.
