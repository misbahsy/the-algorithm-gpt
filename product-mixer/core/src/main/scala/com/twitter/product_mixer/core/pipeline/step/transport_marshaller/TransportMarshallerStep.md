The `TransportMarshallerStep` is a step in a pipeline that takes a domain marshalled result as input and returns a transport-ready marshalled object. The purpose of this step is to convert the domain marshalled result into a format that can be transported over the network. 

The step takes in a `TransportMarshallerExecutor` as a parameter, which is responsible for executing the transport marshalling logic. The step also takes in a `TransportMarshallerConfig`, which contains the `TransportMarshaller` and the identifier of the previous step in the pipeline that performed the domain marshalling. 

The `TransportMarshallerStep` implements the `Step` trait, which defines the behavior of a pipeline step. The `isEmpty` method always returns `false`, indicating that the step is not empty. The `adaptInput` method takes in the current pipeline state and the `TransportMarshallerConfig`, and returns the input to the `TransportMarshallerExecutor`. The `updateState` method is a no-op, as the platform updates the executor result. Finally, the `arrow` method returns an `Arrow` that represents the execution of the `TransportMarshallerExecutor`.

This step is likely used in a larger pipeline that performs various operations on data before transporting it over the network. An example usage of this step might look like:

```
val transportMarshallerStep = TransportMarshallerStep[DomainResponseType, TransportResponseType, State](transportMarshallerExecutor)
val pipeline = Pipeline[State](List(domainMarshallerStep, transportMarshallerStep))
val initialState = State(...)
val finalState = pipeline.run(initialState)
```

In this example, `domainMarshallerStep` is the previous step in the pipeline that performs the domain marshalling. The `Pipeline` is created with a list of steps, and the `run` method is called with an initial state. The `finalState` is the result of running the pipeline on the initial state.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a step in a pipeline that takes a domain marshalled result as input and returns a transport ready marshalled object. It is part of the product mixer core pipeline and uses various other components and services from the project.

2. What are the input and output types for the `TransportMarshallerStep` class?
- The input type is `DomainMarshallerExecutor.Result[DomainResponseType]` and the output type is `TransportMarshallerExecutor.Result[TransportResponseType]`.

3. What is the purpose of the `adaptInput` method and what does it do?
- The `adaptInput` method takes the current state and configuration of the step and returns an input object for the executor. It retrieves the domain marshalled result from the state and creates an input object for the transport marshaller executor using that result.
