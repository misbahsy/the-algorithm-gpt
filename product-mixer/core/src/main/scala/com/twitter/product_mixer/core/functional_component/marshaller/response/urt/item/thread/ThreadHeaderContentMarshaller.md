The `ThreadHeaderContentMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling the `ThreadHeaderContent` object into a `urt.ThreadHeaderContent` object. 

The `ThreadHeaderContent` object is a model object that represents the header of a thread in a messaging system. It contains information about the user who started the thread, the timestamp of the thread, and other metadata. 

The `urt.ThreadHeaderContent` object is a Thrift-generated object that represents the same information as the `ThreadHeaderContent` object. It is used to communicate with other services in the system. 

The `apply` method of the `ThreadHeaderContentMarshaller` class takes a `ThreadHeaderContent` object as input and returns a `urt.ThreadHeaderContent` object. It does this by pattern matching on the type of the `ThreadHeaderContent` object. If the `ThreadHeaderContent` object is of type `UserThreadHeader`, it creates a `urt.UserThreadHeader` object with the `userId` from the `ThreadHeaderContent` object and returns a `urt.ThreadHeaderContent.UserThreadHeader` object with the `urt.UserThreadHeader` object as its parameter. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert `ThreadHeaderContent` objects into `urt.ThreadHeaderContent` objects for communication with other services. 

Example usage:

```
val threadHeaderContent = UserThreadHeader("12345")
val marshaller = new ThreadHeaderContentMarshaller()
val urtThreadHeaderContent = marshaller(threadHeaderContent)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a class called `ThreadHeaderContentMarshaller` that is responsible for converting `ThreadHeaderContent` objects into `urt.ThreadHeaderContent` objects. It is likely part of a larger system for handling threads in a Twitter product.
2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and used throughout the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
3. What is the relationship between `ThreadHeaderContent` and `urt.ThreadHeaderContent`?
   - `ThreadHeaderContent` is likely a custom class defined within the project, while `urt.ThreadHeaderContent` is a class from a Thrift-generated Scala library used for rendering timelines. The `ThreadHeaderContentMarshaller` is responsible for converting between the two.
