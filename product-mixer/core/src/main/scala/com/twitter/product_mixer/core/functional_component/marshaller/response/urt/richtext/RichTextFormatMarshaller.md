The `RichTextFormatMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting the `RichTextFormat` object into a `urt.RichTextFormat` object. The `RichTextFormat` object is an enumeration that contains two cases: `Plain` and `Strong`. The `urt.RichTextFormat` object is a Thrift-generated object that is used to represent rich text formats in the Twitter Timelines service.

The `apply` method takes a `RichTextFormat` object as input and returns a `urt.RichTextFormat` object. The method uses pattern matching to determine which case of the `RichTextFormat` object is being passed in. If the case is `Plain`, the method returns `urt.RichTextFormat.Plain`. If the case is `Strong`, the method returns `urt.RichTextFormat.Strong`.

This class is used in the larger project to convert the `RichTextFormat` object into a format that can be used by the Twitter Timelines service. This conversion is necessary because the `RichTextFormat` object is specific to the project, while the `urt.RichTextFormat` object is used by the Twitter Timelines service. By using this class, the project can ensure that the rich text formats are properly represented in the Twitter Timelines service.

Example usage:

```
val marshaller = new RichTextFormatMarshaller()
val plainFormat = RichTextFormat.Plain
val urtFormat = marshaller(plainFormat) // urtFormat is now urt.RichTextFormat.Plain
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a marshaller for converting RichTextFormat objects into their corresponding thriftscala objects. It is used in the functional component of the product mixer core.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on classes from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.richtext and com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala packages.

3. Why is the RichTextFormatMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class should be instantiated and managed by a dependency injection framework.
