The `RosettaColorMarshaller` class is responsible for converting `RosettaColor` objects to `urt.RosettaColor` objects. This class is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and rendering timelines. 

The `apply` method takes a `RosettaColor` object as input and returns the corresponding `urt.RosettaColor` object. The `match` statement matches the input `RosettaColor` object to one of the predefined `RosettaColor` objects and returns the corresponding `urt.RosettaColor` object. 

For example, if the input `RosettaColor` object is `WhiteRosettaColor`, the `apply` method will return `urt.RosettaColor.White`. Similarly, if the input `RosettaColor` object is `DeepBlueRosettaColor`, the `apply` method will return `urt.RosettaColor.DeepBlue`.

This class is likely used in the larger project to convert `RosettaColor` objects to `urt.RosettaColor` objects for rendering timelines. For example, if a timeline contains a tweet with a `RosettaColor` object representing the background color of the tweet, this class can be used to convert the `RosettaColor` object to a `urt.RosettaColor` object that can be used to render the tweet with the correct background color. 

Example usage:

```
val rosettaColor: RosettaColor = DeepBlueRosettaColor
val marshaller: RosettaColorMarshaller = new RosettaColorMarshaller()
val urtColor: urt.RosettaColor = marshaller(rosettaColor)
// urtColor is now urt.RosettaColor.DeepBlue
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a color marshaller for the RosettaColor class, which maps RosettaColor values to corresponding urt.RosettaColor values.

2. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to mark the constructor that should be used for dependency injection.

3. What is the relationship between RosettaColor and urt.RosettaColor?
- RosettaColor is a custom color class, while urt.RosettaColor is a color class from the timelines.render.thriftscala package. This code maps values from RosettaColor to corresponding values in urt.RosettaColor.
