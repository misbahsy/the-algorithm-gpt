The `GenericSummaryDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling a `GenericSummaryItemDisplayType` object into a `urt.GenericSummaryDisplayType` object. 

The `GenericSummaryItemDisplayType` object is an enum that represents the different types of display options for a generic summary item. The `HeroDisplayType` is one of the options and represents a hero display type. 

The `urt.GenericSummaryDisplayType` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents the different types of display options for a generic summary item in the User Recommendation Timeline (URT) service. The `Hero` option is one of the options and represents a hero display type. 

The `apply` method takes a `GenericSummaryItemDisplayType` object as input and returns a `urt.GenericSummaryDisplayType` object. If the input is of type `HeroDisplayType`, the method returns a `urt.GenericSummaryDisplayType.Hero` object. 

This class can be used in the larger project to convert a `GenericSummaryItemDisplayType` object into a `urt.GenericSummaryDisplayType` object. This conversion is necessary when passing data between different parts of the URT service that use different representations of the same data. 

Example usage:

```
val marshaller = new GenericSummaryDisplayTypeMarshaller()
val displayType = marshaller(HeroDisplayType)
// displayType is now a urt.GenericSummaryDisplayType.Hero object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a specific type of response item called GenericSummaryItemDisplayType. It maps this type to a corresponding type in the urt package.
2. What other types of display types are available besides HeroDisplayType?
   - It is not clear from this code what other types of display types are available besides HeroDisplayType. It would require looking at the definition of GenericSummaryItemDisplayType to determine this.
3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected by a dependency injection framework.
