The code defines a trait called `PipelineBuilder` that is used to build a pipeline of steps to execute on a given input query. The pipeline is broken down into a sequence of steps, each of which is represented as an `Executor`. The `PipelineBuilder` trait defines a `Step` trait that has three parts: an underlying `Executor` arrow, an input adaptor to extract the right data from the previous `PipelineResult`, and a result updater to update the `PipelineResult`. 

The `PipelineBuilder` trait also defines a method called `buildCombinedArrowFromSteps` that takes a sequence of `Step`s and builds a combined arrow out of them. The method wraps the steps in error handling and only executes each step if the previous step is successful. The resulting arrow takes a query as input and returns a `PipelineResultType` as output.

The `PipelineBuilder` trait also defines a method called `buildGaugesForQualityFactor` that sets up stats gauges for any `QualityFactorStatus`. These gauges are used to monitor the quality of the pipeline.

Overall, the `PipelineBuilder` trait provides a flexible way to build pipelines of steps that can be executed on a given input query. The trait separates the logic of each step into an `Executor` that can be reused between pipelines, and the `PipelineResult` generated by previous steps is passed to each step so that it can update it with some new data. This keeps knowledge of `PipelineResult` out of the executors, so they're reusable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the PipelineBuilder trait?
- The PipelineBuilder trait defines a set of abstractions for building a pipeline of steps that can be executed in a linear sequence, with each step having access to the PipelineResult generated by previous steps, and can update it with some new data.

2. What is the significance of the ResultUpdater trait?
- The ResultUpdater trait is used to update the PipelineResult with new data when a step is mostly the same, but only the result update changes, such as with multi-step hydration.

3. What is the purpose of the buildCombinedArrowFromSteps method?
- The buildCombinedArrowFromSteps method builds a combined arrow out of steps, wraps them in error handling, and only executes each step if the previous step is successful. It returns an Arrow that takes a Query as input and returns a PipelineResultType as output.
