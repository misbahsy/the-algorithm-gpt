The `ReferenceObjectMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling different types of reference objects used in rich text. This class is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and rendering rich text in some way.

The class imports several other classes and interfaces, including `UrlMarshaller`, `Url`, and various types of `RichText` objects. These classes likely represent different types of reference objects that can be used in rich text, such as URLs, user mentions, hashtags, and lists.

The `ReferenceObjectMarshaller` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It also takes an instance of `UrlMarshaller` as a constructor argument, which suggests that this class is dependent on the `UrlMarshaller` class to function properly.

The main method in this class is `apply`, which takes a `ReferenceObject` as an argument and returns a corresponding `urt.ReferenceObject`. This method uses pattern matching to determine the type of the input `ReferenceObject` and then creates a new `urt.ReferenceObject` based on that type. For example, if the input `ReferenceObject` is a `Url`, the method creates a new `urt.ReferenceObject.Url` object using the `urlMarshaller` to marshal the `Url` object.

Overall, the `ReferenceObjectMarshaller` class is an important component of the larger project that likely involves processing and rendering rich text. It provides a way to marshal different types of reference objects used in rich text, such as URLs, user mentions, hashtags, and lists, into a format that can be used by other parts of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for different types of reference objects used in rich text. It converts instances of these objects into corresponding instances of a Thrift-generated class called `urt.ReferenceObject`.

2. What are the dependencies of this class?
- This class depends on several other classes and packages, including `UrlMarshaller`, `Url`, and various classes from `RichTextCashtag` to `RichTextUser`. It also depends on the `thriftscala` package generated by Thrift.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes an instance of a reference object (either a `Url`, `RichTextUser`, `RichTextMention`, `RichTextHashtag`, `RichTextCashtag`, or `RichTextList`) and returns an instance of `urt.ReferenceObject`. The specific type of `urt.ReferenceObject` returned depends on the type of the input reference object.
