The `GridCarouselMetadataMarshaller` class is a part of the functional component of the Twitter product mixer project. This class is responsible for marshalling the `GridCarouselMetadata` object into a `urt.GridCarouselMetadata` object. 

The `GridCarouselMetadata` object contains metadata about a grid carousel, which is a UI component used to display a collection of items in a grid format. The metadata includes the number of rows in the grid. 

The `apply` method takes in a `GridCarouselMetadata` object and returns a `urt.GridCarouselMetadata` object with the number of rows set to the value of the `numRows` field in the input object. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert the `GridCarouselMetadata` object into a format that can be used by other components of the system. For example, this marshalled object may be used by a rendering component to display the grid carousel on a user's timeline. 

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```scala
val gridCarouselMetadata = GridCarouselMetadata(numRows = 3)
val marshaller = GridCarouselMetadataMarshaller()
val urtGridCarouselMetadata = marshaller(gridCarouselMetadata)
// urtGridCarouselMetadata.numRows == 3
```

In this example, a `GridCarouselMetadata` object is created with 3 rows. The `GridCarouselMetadataMarshaller` is then instantiated and used to marshal the object into a `urt.GridCarouselMetadata` object. The resulting object has the `numRows` field set to 3, as expected.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a marshaller for GridCarouselMetadata objects in the response of a timeline module. It converts a GridCarouselMetadata object to a thriftscala GridCarouselMetadata object.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the GridCarouselMetadata class from com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.timeline_module and the thriftscala GridCarouselMetadata class from com.twitter.timelines.render.

3. Why is the GridCarouselMetadataMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of the GridCarouselMetadataMarshaller class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class can be injected as a dependency in other classes that require it.
