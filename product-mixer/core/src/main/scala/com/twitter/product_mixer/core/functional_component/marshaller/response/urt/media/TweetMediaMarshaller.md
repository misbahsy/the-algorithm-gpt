The `TweetMediaMarshaller` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling `TweetMedia` objects into `urt.TweetMedia` objects. 

The `TweetMedia` object is a model object that represents media attached to a tweet. It contains two fields: `tweetId` and `momentId`. The `apply` method of the `TweetMediaMarshaller` class takes a `TweetMedia` object as input and returns a `urt.TweetMedia` object. The `urt.TweetMedia` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents media attached to a tweet in the context of the Unified Timeline Service (URT) of Twitter.

The `TweetMediaMarshaller` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire application. This is a common design pattern used in dependency injection frameworks like Guice.

This class is used in the larger project to convert `TweetMedia` objects into `urt.TweetMedia` objects. This conversion is necessary because the URT service expects media objects to be in the `urt.TweetMedia` format. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val tweetMedia = TweetMedia(tweetId = "12345", momentId = "67890")
val tweetMediaMarshaller = new TweetMediaMarshaller()
val urtTweetMedia = tweetMediaMarshaller(tweetMedia)
```

In this example, a `TweetMedia` object is created with a `tweetId` of "12345" and a `momentId` of "67890". Then, a new instance of the `TweetMediaMarshaller` class is created. Finally, the `apply` method of the `TweetMediaMarshaller` class is called with the `TweetMedia` object as input, and the resulting `urt.TweetMedia` object is stored in the `urtTweetMedia` variable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a TweetMediaMarshaller class that takes in a TweetMedia object and returns a urt.TweetMedia object with tweetId and momentId fields.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the TweetMedia class from com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.media and the urt.TweetMedia class from com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala.
3. Why is the TweetMediaMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class can be injected as a dependency into other classes.
