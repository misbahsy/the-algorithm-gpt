The `ShowAlertColorConfigurationMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `ShowAlertColorConfiguration` objects into `urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration` objects. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and displaying alerts in some way.

The `ShowAlertColorConfiguration` class contains information about the colors to use when displaying an alert. This includes the background color, text color, and border color. The `urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration` class is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same information in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized.

The `ShowAlertColorConfigurationMarshaller` class has a single method, `apply`, which takes a `ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object and returns a `urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object. This method uses an instance of the `RosettaColorMarshaller` class to convert the `background` and `text` colors to their Thrift equivalents. If a `border` color is present, it is also converted using the `RosettaColorMarshaller`. The resulting `urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object is then returned.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val colorConfiguration = ShowAlertColorConfiguration(
  background = "#FFFFFF",
  text = "#000000",
  border = Some("#FF0000")
)

val marshaller = new ShowAlertColorConfigurationMarshaller(new RosettaColorMarshaller())

val urtColorConfiguration = marshaller(colorConfiguration)

// urtColorConfiguration can now be serialized and sent to another component for processing or storage
``` 

In this example, a `ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object is created with a white background, black text, and a red border. An instance of the `ShowAlertColorConfigurationMarshaller` class is then created, along with an instance of the `RosettaColorMarshaller` class that it depends on. The `ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object is then marshalled into a `urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object using the `apply` method of the `ShowAlertColorConfigurationMarshaller`. The resulting `urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration` object can then be serialized and sent to another component for further processing or storage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a color configuration used in the response of an alert in a product mixer. It converts the configuration into a format used by the urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration class.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the RosettaColorMarshaller class, which is located in a different package, as well as the urt.ShowAlertColorConfiguration class.
3. What design pattern is being used in this code?
   - This code is using the Singleton design pattern, as indicated by the @Singleton annotation on the class definition.
