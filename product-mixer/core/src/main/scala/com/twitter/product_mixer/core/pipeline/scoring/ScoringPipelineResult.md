The `ScoringPipelineResult` class is a representation of the results of each step in the scoring pipeline process. It contains information about the gate results, selector results, pre-scoring hydration phase 1 and 2 results, scorer results, pipeline failure, and the final result which is a sequence of scored candidate results. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to track the progress of the scoring pipeline and to store the results of each step. It is used in the larger project to ensure that the scoring pipeline is working correctly and to provide feedback to the user about the results of the pipeline.

The `ScoringPipelineResult` class is a case class, which means that it is immutable and can be easily copied and modified. It extends the `PipelineResult` trait, which provides a way to get the size of the final result. The `resultSize` method returns the size of the final result, which is the number of scored candidate results.

The `withFailure` and `withResult` methods are used to modify the `ScoringPipelineResult` object. The `withFailure` method takes a `PipelineFailure` object and returns a new `ScoringPipelineResult` object with the failure field set to the provided failure object. The `withResult` method takes a sequence of `ScoredCandidateResult` objects and returns a new `ScoringPipelineResult` object with the result field set to the provided sequence.

The `ScoringPipelineResult` object also contains an `empty` method, which returns an empty `ScoringPipelineResult` object with all fields set to `None`. This method is useful for initializing a new `ScoringPipelineResult` object.

Example usage:

```scala
val scoringPipelineResult = ScoringPipelineResult.empty[Candidate]
// run scoring pipeline and update scoringPipelineResult object with results
scoringPipelineResult.withResult(scoredCandidateResults)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the ScoringPipelineResult class?
- The ScoringPipelineResult class represents the results of every step during the ScoringPipeline process, containing only the candidates that were actually scored with an updated, combined feature map of all features that were passed in with the candidate plus all features returned as part of scoring.

2. What are the generic type constraints on the ScoringPipelineResult class?
- The ScoringPipelineResult class has a generic type constraint that the Candidate type must extend UniversalNoun[Any].

3. What is the purpose of the empty method in the ScoringPipelineResult object?
- The empty method in the ScoringPipelineResult object returns an empty ScoringPipelineResult instance with all optional fields set to None.
