The `EmptyResponseRateAlert` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for triggering an alert when the percentage of requests with empty responses rises above a certain threshold for a configured amount of time. 

The class takes in four parameters: `notificationGroup`, `warnPredicate`, `criticalPredicate`, and `runbookLink`. `notificationGroup` is an instance of the `NotificationGroup` class, which is responsible for grouping alerts together. `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` are instances of the `TriggerIfAbove` class, which is responsible for defining the threshold for triggering the alert. `runbookLink` is an optional parameter that provides a link to a runbook that contains instructions for handling the alert.

The `EmptyResponseRateAlert` class extends the `Alert` class, which is responsible for defining the basic properties of an alert. The `alertType` property is set to `EmptyResponseRate`, which indicates that this alert is triggered when the percentage of requests with empty responses rises above the threshold.

The `require` statements in the class ensure that the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds are between 0 and 100%. If the thresholds are outside of this range, an exception is thrown.

Overall, the `EmptyResponseRateAlert` class is an important component of the larger project as it helps to monitor the percentage of requests with empty responses and trigger an alert when necessary. Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
val notificationGroup = NotificationGroup("Empty Response Rate Alerts")
val warnPredicate = TriggerIfAbove(80)
val criticalPredicate = TriggerIfAbove(90)
val runbookLink = Some("https://example.com/runbook")
val emptyResponseRateAlert = EmptyResponseRateAlert(notificationGroup, warnPredicate, criticalPredicate, runbookLink)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What triggers the EmptyResponseRateAlert and how is it defined?
- The EmptyResponseRateAlert is triggered when the percentage of requests with empty responses rises above the TriggerIfAbove threshold for a configured amount of time. This is defined in the code's documentation.

2. What is the range of EmptyResponseRate thresholds?
- The EmptyResponseRate thresholds must be between 0 and 100%, as stated in the code's documentation.

3. What is the purpose of the require statements in the code?
- The require statements ensure that the warnPredicate and criticalPredicate thresholds are within the valid range of 0 to 100%. If they are not within this range, an exception will be thrown.
