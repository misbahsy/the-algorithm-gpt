The `ProductMixerController` class is responsible for registering endpoints that enable Product Mixer tooling such as alerts, dashboard generation, and Turntable. The class takes two parameters: an `Injector` and a `ThriftMethod`. The `Injector` is used to inject dependencies, while the `ThriftMethod` is a thrift service containing the debug endpoint. The class extends the `Controller` class from the Finatra HTTP framework.

The `ProductMixerController` class has two main routes: `/admin/product-mixer` and `/product-mixer`. The former is only registered if the `isLocal` flag is false. If it is registered, it retrieves all registered components from the `ComponentRegistry` and creates a debug query endpoint for each product. The debug query endpoint is used to run queries against a specific product. The endpoint is registered with the product name as a parameter, and a `RouteIndex` is also created to group the endpoint under the "Feeds/Debug Query" category. When the endpoint is accessed, it redirects to a URL that contains the service name, product name, and service path.

The `/product-mixer` route has two endpoints: `/component-registry` and `/debug-configuration`. The former retrieves the component registry from the `ComponentRegistry` and returns it as a JSON response. The latter returns the debug configuration for the debug endpoint as a JSON response.

Overall, the `ProductMixerController` class is an important part of the Product Mixer tooling, as it registers endpoints that enable debugging and configuration of the tool. It is used in conjunction with other classes and modules to provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing and monitoring products. Below is an example of how to use the `ProductMixerController` class:

```scala
val controller = ProductMixerController[MyThriftService](injector, MyThriftService.DebugEndpoint)
```

In this example, `MyThriftService` is a thrift service that contains a debug endpoint. The `injector` is an instance of the `Injector` class, which is used to inject dependencies. The `controller` variable is an instance of the `ProductMixerController` class, which can be used to register endpoints and handle requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code registers endpoints for enabling Product Mixer tooling such as alerts, dashboard generation, and Turntable. It also provides a debug endpoint to run queries against.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Finagle, Finatra, Scrooge, and Twitter Util. It also depends on a custom module called ProductMixerFlagModule.

3. What is the significance of the `isLocal` variable and how is it used?
- The `isLocal` variable is used to determine whether the service is running locally or not. If it is not running locally, it registers endpoints under the "/admin/product-mixer" prefix. If it is running locally, it skips this step.
