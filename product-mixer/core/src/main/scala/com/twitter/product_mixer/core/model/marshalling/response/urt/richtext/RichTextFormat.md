This code defines a sealed trait called `RichTextFormat` and two case objects that extend it: `Plain` and `Strong`. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent different formats of rich text in a response from the `product_mixer` core model. The `RichTextFormat` trait defines a `name` method that returns a string representing the name of the format. The `Plain` and `Strong` case objects override this method to return the strings "Plain" and "Strong", respectively. 

This code can be used in the larger project to represent different formats of rich text in responses. For example, if a response includes a field that contains rich text, the format of that text can be represented using one of these case objects. This can be useful for downstream processing of the response, such as rendering the text in a user interface. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a response from the `product_mixer` core model:

```
{
  "text": "This is some <strong>bold</strong> text.",
  "format": "Strong"
}
```

In this example, the `text` field contains rich text with a bold section, and the `format` field indicates that the bold section should be represented using the `Strong` format. This information can be used by downstream code to properly render the bold section of the text.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used within the larger project?
- This code defines a sealed trait and two case objects for different rich text formats. It is likely used in the marshalling and unmarshalling of response data for the product mixer core model.

2. Are there any other rich text formats that are used in this project?
- It is unclear from this code snippet whether there are other rich text formats used in the project. It is possible that there are additional case objects defined elsewhere.

3. How does this code interact with other parts of the project, such as the front-end or database?
- Without additional context, it is difficult to determine how this code interacts with other parts of the project. It is possible that this code is used primarily in the backend and does not directly interact with the front-end or database.
