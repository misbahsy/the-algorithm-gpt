This code defines classes and traits related to the Candidate Feature Hydrator Executor, which is a component of the larger product mixer system at Twitter. The purpose of this component is to take a set of candidate products and add additional features to them based on various individual feature hydrators. 

The main class defined in this code is `CandidateFeatureHydratorExecutorResult`, which represents the result of running the candidate feature hydrator executor. It contains two fields: `results`, which is a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects representing the candidates with their added features, and `individualFeatureHydratorResults`, which is a map of `ComponentIdentifier` objects to `BaseIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` objects. The `ComponentIdentifier` is used to identify the individual feature hydrator that was used to add features to the candidates, and the `BaseIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` represents the result of running that hydrator. 

There are two subclasses of `BaseIndividualFeatureHydratorResult` defined in this code: `FeatureHydratorDisabled` and `IndividualFeatureHydratorResult`. `FeatureHydratorDisabled` represents the case where a particular feature hydrator was disabled and did not add any features to the candidates. `IndividualFeatureHydratorResult` represents the case where a feature hydrator was run and did add features to the candidates. 

Overall, this code provides a way to run the candidate feature hydrator executor and get back a result that includes the candidates with their added features as well as information about which individual feature hydrators were run and whether they added any features. This information can be used by other components of the product mixer system to further process the candidates and make decisions about which products to recommend to users. 

Example usage:

```
val executorResult = CandidateFeatureHydratorExecutor.run(candidates)
val results = executorResult.results
val individualResults = executorResult.individualFeatureHydratorResults

// process results and individualResults as needed
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code defines case classes and traits related to candidate feature hydrator executor results in the Twitter product mixer core service. It likely solves the problem of efficiently processing and organizing candidate features for the product mixer.
2. What is the significance of the UniversalNoun and ComponentIdentifier types?
   - UniversalNoun is a common model type used throughout the product mixer core service, likely representing a generic product or item. ComponentIdentifier is another common model type used to identify specific components of a product or item. Both types are used in this code to define the types of results and individual feature hydrator results.
3. How are the results and individual feature hydrator results organized and accessed in this code?
   - The results are stored in a sequence of CandidateWithFeatures objects, while the individual feature hydrator results are stored in a map with ComponentIdentifier keys and BaseIndividualFeatureHydratorResult values. These can be accessed through the results and individualFeatureHydratorResults properties of the CandidateFeatureHydratorExecutorResult object.
