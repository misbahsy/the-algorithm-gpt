This code defines a sealed trait called `EventSummaryDisplayType` and three case objects that extend it: `CellEventSummaryDisplayType`, `HeroEventSummaryDisplayType`, and `CellWithProminentSocialContextEventSummaryDisplayType`. 

In the larger project, this code may be used to represent different types of event summaries in a user interface. The `EventSummaryDisplayType` trait serves as a base type for these different types of event summaries, and the case objects provide specific implementations for each type. 

For example, the `CellEventSummaryDisplayType` case object may be used to represent a simple event summary that is displayed in a grid cell, while the `HeroEventSummaryDisplayType` case object may be used to represent a more prominent event summary that is displayed at the top of a page. The `CellWithProminentSocialContextEventSummaryDisplayType` case object may be used to represent a cell event summary that also includes prominent social context information. 

Developers working on the project can use these case objects to create instances of event summaries with the appropriate display type. For example, they might create a `CellEventSummary` object like this:

```
val summary = CellEventSummary(title = "My Event", description = "An event description")
```

This code would create a new `CellEventSummary` object with the `CellEventSummaryDisplayType` display type and the specified title and description. 

Overall, this code provides a flexible way to represent different types of event summaries in the project's user interface. By defining a base trait and several case objects that extend it, developers can easily create instances of event summaries with the appropriate display type.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used within the larger project?
   - This code defines a sealed trait and three case objects related to event summary display types. A smart developer might want to know how these types are used within the project and what functionality they enable.

2. Are there any other classes or files that interact with this code?
   - A smart developer might want to know if there are any other classes or files that depend on or interact with this code, as this could impact how changes to this code are made.

3. Are there any potential issues or limitations with using a sealed trait and case objects for this functionality?
   - A smart developer might want to consider if there are any drawbacks or limitations to using a sealed trait and case objects for this functionality, and if there are any alternative approaches that could be considered.
