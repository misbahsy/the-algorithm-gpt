The `FilterExecutor` class is responsible for applying a sequence of filters to a set of candidates in a pipeline. The class takes in a sequence of `Filter` objects and a `Context` object, and returns an `Arrow` that applies the filters in sequence. The `Arrow` takes in a tuple of a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures`, and returns a `FilterExecutorResult` object that contains the filtered candidates and a sequence of individual filter results.

Each filter is only passed the "kept" sequence from the previous filter, not the full set of candidates. The `FilterExecutor` class also adds filter-specific stats, generic `wrapComponentWithExecutorBookkeeping` stats, and wraps the filters with failure handling. If a filter is a `Conditionally`, it ensures that stats are not recorded if it is turned off.

The `FilterExecutor` class has a private case class called `FilterState`, which is an internal representation of the state that is passed between each individual filter arrow. It contains the query, a lookup mapping from `Candidate` to `CandidateWithFeatures`, and the in-progress executor result.

The `getIsoArrowForFilter` method takes in a `Filter` object and a `Context` object and returns an `Iso` arrow for easier composition later. It adds filter-specific stats, generic `wrapComponentWithExecutorBookkeeping` stats, and wraps the filters with failure handling. If a filter is a `Conditionally`, it ensures that stats are not recorded if it is turned off.

The `arrow` method takes in a sequence of `Filter` objects and a `Context` object and returns an `Arrow` that applies the filters in sequence. It transforms the input to the initial state of a `FilterExecutorResult` and creates a map of all candidates. It then applies the filters in sequence and returns a `FilterExecutorResult` object that contains the filtered candidates and a sequence of individual filter results.

Overall, the `FilterExecutor` class is a crucial component of the pipeline that applies a sequence of filters to a set of candidates and returns the filtered candidates and a sequence of individual filter results.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code applies a sequence of filters to a set of candidates and returns the results along with a detailed sequence of each filter's results. It is part of the product mixer core service filter executor in the larger project.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.filter.Filter, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.CandidateWithFeatures, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.Conditionally, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.UniversalNoun, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.service.Executor, com.twitter.stitch.Arrow, com.twitter.stitch.Arrow.Iso, javax.inject.Inject, javax.inject.Singleton, and scala.collection.immutable.Queue.

3. What is the purpose of the FilterState case class and how is it used in this code?
- The FilterState case class is an internal representation of the state that is passed between each individual filter arrow. It contains the query, a lookup mapping from Candidate to FilterCandidate, and the in-progress executor result. It is used to rebuild the inputs quickly for the next filter and to update the executor result with the results of each filter.
