The `DataRecordConverter` object and class in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.datarecord` package are used to construct a `FeatureMap` from a `DataRecord`. The `FeatureMap` is a map of `Feature` objects to their values, where a `Feature` is a representation of a feature in a machine learning model. The `DataRecord` is a record of data that can be used to train a machine learning model. 

The `DataRecordConverter` class takes a `FeaturesScope` object as a parameter in its constructor. The `FeaturesScope` object contains a predefined set of `BaseDataRecordFeatures` that should be included in the output `FeatureMap`. The `BaseDataRecordFeature` is a trait that defines the behavior of a feature that can be included in a `DataRecord`. 

The `toDataRecord` method of the `DataRecordConverter` class takes a `FeatureMap` object as a parameter and returns a `DataRecord` object. The method initializes a `richDataRecord` object with the Feature Store features in it and then adds all the non-Feature Store features that support `DataRecords` to the `DataRecord`. The Feature Store features are already in the initial `DataRecord`, so they don't need to be added again. If there are any pre-built `DataRecords`, they are merged in. 

The `DataRecordConverter` class uses the `DataRecordMerger` object to merge pre-built `DataRecords`. The `DataRecordMerger` is a utility class that merges two `DataRecord` objects into a single `DataRecord`. 

The `DataRecordConverter` class uses pattern matching to add the non-Feature Store features to the `DataRecord`. If the feature is a `FeatureStoreDataRecordFeature`, it is skipped. If the feature is a `DataRecordFeature` that is compatible with `DataRecords`, its value is added to the `DataRecord`. If the feature is an `OptionalDataRecordFeature` that is compatible with `DataRecords`, its value is added to the `DataRecord` if it is present. If the feature is a `DataRecordInAFeature`, it is merged with the `richDataRecord` object using the `DataRecordMerger`.

This code is used to convert a `DataRecord` object to a `FeatureMap` object, which can be used to train a machine learning model. The `DataRecordConverter` class is used in the larger project to convert data into a format that can be used to train machine learning models. 

Example usage:

```
val featuresScope = new FeaturesScope[BaseDataRecordFeature[_, _]] {
  override def getFeatureStoreFeaturesDataRecord(featureMap: FeatureMap): RichDataRecord = ???
  override def getNonFeatureStoreDataRecordFeatures(featureMap: FeatureMap): Seq[BaseDataRecordFeature[_, _]] = ???
}

val dataRecordConverter = new DataRecordConverter(featuresScope)

val dataRecord = ???
val featureMap = dataRecordConverter.toFeatureMap(dataRecord)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DataRecordConverter` class?
- The `DataRecordConverter` class is used to construct a `FeatureMap` from a `DataRecord`, based on a predefined set of features from a `FeaturesScope`.

2. What is the role of the `DataRecordMerger` object?
- The `DataRecordMerger` object is used to merge pre-built `DataRecords` into the `richDataRecord`.

3. What types of features are included in the `FeatureMap` constructed by the `DataRecordConverter`?
- The `FeatureMap` constructed by the `DataRecordConverter` includes a predefined set of `BaseDataRecordFeatures` from a `FeaturesScope`, as well as non-`FeatureStore` features that support `DataRecords`.
