This code defines two traits, `ExecuteSynchronously` and `FailOpen`, which are used as modifiers for any `SideEffect` in the larger project. 

The `ExecuteSynchronously` trait ensures that the request waits for the `SideEffect` to complete before being returned. This means that the `SideEffect`'s latency will impact the overall request's latency. This can be useful in cases where it is important to ensure that the `SideEffect` has completed before moving on to the next step in the request. 

The `FailOpen` trait is a modifier for `ExecuteSynchronously` `SideEffects` that makes it so failures will be reported in the results but won't cause the request as a whole to fail. This can be useful in cases where it is acceptable for a `SideEffect` to fail without causing the entire request to fail. 

Both traits are used as mixins with `SideEffect` classes in the larger project. For example, a `MySideEffect` class could be defined as follows: 

```
class MySideEffect extends PipelineResultSideEffect[T] with ExecuteSynchronously with FailOpen {...}
```

This would create a `MySideEffect` that waits for completion before returning and reports failures without causing the entire request to fail. 

Overall, these traits provide flexibility and control over how `SideEffects` are handled in the larger project, allowing for customization based on specific needs and requirements.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExecuteSynchronously` trait?
   - The `ExecuteSynchronously` trait is a modifier for any `SideEffect` that makes the request wait for it to complete before being returned, impacting the overall request's latency.

2. Can any `SideEffect` be modified with the `ExecuteSynchronously` trait?
   - Yes, any `SideEffect` can be modified with the `ExecuteSynchronously` trait as long as it is a subtype of `SideEffect[_]`.

3. What is the purpose of the `FailOpen` trait?
   - The `FailOpen` trait is a modifier for any `ExecuteSynchronously` `SideEffect` that allows failures to be reported in the results but won't cause the request as a whole to fail.
