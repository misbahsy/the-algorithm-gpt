The `TopicPageHeaderMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `TopicPageHeader` object into a `urp.TopicPageHeader` object, which is a Thrift-generated class used for communication between microservices at Twitter. This class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The `TopicPageHeader` object contains information about a topic page, such as the topic ID, facepile, client event information, landing context, and display type. The `TopicPageHeaderMarshaller` class takes this information and maps it to the corresponding fields in the `urp.TopicPageHeader` object.

The `apply` method is the main method of this class, which takes a `TopicPageHeader` object as input and returns a `urp.TopicPageHeader` object. The `topicPageHeaderFacepileMarshaller`, `clientEventInfoMarshaller`, and `topicPageHeaderDisplayTypeMarshaller` objects are injected into the class using the `@Inject` annotation, which allows for dependency injection.

The `facepile` and `clientEventInfo` fields are optional, so the `map` method is used to apply the corresponding marshaller functions only if the fields are present in the `TopicPageHeader` object. The `displayType` field is also optional, but if it is not present, the default value of `urp.TopicPageHeaderDisplayType.Basic` is used.

This class is used in the larger project to convert `TopicPageHeader` objects into `urp.TopicPageHeader` objects for communication between microservices. An example usage of this class would be in a service that retrieves topic page information and needs to communicate that information to another service. The `TopicPageHeaderMarshaller` class would be used to convert the `TopicPageHeader` object into a `urp.TopicPageHeader` object before sending it over the wire.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a TopicPageHeader object and converts it into a thriftscala TopicPageHeader object. It uses other marshallers to convert nested objects within the TopicPageHeader.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on other classes from the com.twitter.product_mixer and com.twitter.pages.render packages, as well as the javax.inject package.
3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to specify dependencies that should be injected into the constructor when an instance of this class is created.
