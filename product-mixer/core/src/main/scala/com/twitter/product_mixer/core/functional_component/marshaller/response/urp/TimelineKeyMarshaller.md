The `TimelineKeyMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `TimelineKey` object into a `graphql.TimelineKey` object. The `TimelineKey` object is an abstract class that represents a timeline key used to identify a specific timeline in the Twitter product mixer. The `graphql.TimelineKey` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same timeline key in the GraphQL schema.

The `apply` method takes a `TimelineKey` object as input and returns a `graphql.TimelineKey` object. The method uses pattern matching to determine the type of the `TimelineKey` object and creates the corresponding `graphql.TimelineKey` object. For example, if the `TimelineKey` object is of type `TopicsLandingTimeline`, the method creates a `graphql.TimelineKey.TopicTimeline` object with a `graphql.TopicId` object as its argument.

This class is used in the larger project to convert timeline keys between different representations. For example, when a client requests a timeline from the Twitter product mixer, the timeline key is sent as a `TimelineKey` object. The server then uses the `TimelineKeyMarshaller` class to convert the `TimelineKey` object into a `graphql.TimelineKey` object, which is used to query the timeline data from the database.

Example usage:

```
val timelineKey = TopicsLandingTimeline("12345")
val marshaller = new TimelineKeyMarshaller()
val graphqlKey = marshaller(timelineKey)
``` 

In this example, a `TopicsLandingTimeline` object is created with a topic ID of "12345". The `TimelineKeyMarshaller` object is then used to convert the `TopicsLandingTimeline` object into a `graphql.TimelineKey` object. The resulting `graphql.TimelineKey` object can then be used to query the timeline data from the database using GraphQL.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a marshaller for converting different types of timeline keys into a GraphQL timeline key. It solves the problem of having multiple timeline key types that need to be converted into a single format for use in GraphQL.

2. What are the different types of timeline keys that can be converted using this marshaller?
- The different types of timeline keys that can be converted include TopicsLandingTimeline, NoteworthyAccountsTimeline, TopicsPickerTimeline, FollowedTopicsMeTimeline, NotInterestedTopicsMeTimeline, FollowedTopicsOtherTimeline, NuxUserRecommendationsTimeline, NuxForYouCategoryUserRecommendationsTimeline, NuxPymkCategoryUserRecommendationsTimeline, NuxGeoCategoryUserRecommendationsTimeline, NuxSingleInterestCategoryUserRecommendationsTimeline, ShoppingHomeTimeline, ForYouExploreMixerTimeline, and TrendingExploreMixerTimeline.

3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` annotation in this code?
- The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the TimelineKeyMarshaller class should be created and used throughout the application. This can help improve performance and reduce memory usage.
