The `TopicItemMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `TopicItem` object into a `urt.TimelineItemContent` object, which is used in the larger project to display topic-related content in a user's timeline. 

The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It is also injected with two dependencies: `TopicDisplayTypeMarshaller` and `TopicFunctionalityTypeMarshaller`. These dependencies are used to convert the `topicDisplayType` and `topicFunctionalityType` fields of the `TopicItem` object into their corresponding `urt` types.

The `apply` method takes a `TopicItem` object as input and returns a `urt.TimelineItemContent` object. It creates a `urt.Topic` object using the `id`, `topicDisplayType`, and `topicFunctionalityType` fields of the `TopicItem` object. If the `topicDisplayType` or `topicFunctionalityType` fields are not present in the `TopicItem` object, it defaults to `urt.TopicDisplayType.Basic` and `urt.TopicFunctionalityType.Basic`, respectively. The `reactiveTriggers` field is currently not required and is set to `None`.

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```scala
val topicItem = TopicItem(id = 123, topicDisplayType = Some("featured"), topicFunctionalityType = None)
val topicItemMarshaller = new TopicItemMarshaller(new TopicDisplayTypeMarshaller, new TopicFunctionalityTypeMarshaller)
val timelineItemContent = topicItemMarshaller(topicItem)
// timelineItemContent is now a urt.TimelineItemContent.Topic object with the corresponding fields from the topicItem object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a `TopicItem` object into a `urt.TimelineItemContent` object. It uses two other marshallers (`TopicDisplayTypeMarshaller` and `TopicFunctionalityTypeMarshaller`) to convert the `topicDisplayType` and `topicFunctionalityType` fields of the `TopicItem` object, respectively.
   
2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor of this class as one that should be used for dependency injection, allowing the `displayTypeMarshaller` and `functionalityTypeMarshaller` objects to be automatically provided by the dependency injection framework.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `reactiveTriggers` field and why is it currently not required?
   - The `reactiveTriggers` field is a part of the `urt.Topic` object that is being created, but it is currently not required by users of this library. It is likely that this field is used for some kind of reactive functionality that is not currently being utilized by the library's users.
