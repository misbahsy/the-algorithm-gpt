The `RichTextEntityMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `RichTextEntity` objects into `urt.RichTextEntity` objects. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and rendering rich text content.

The `RichTextEntity` class represents a single entity within a larger body of rich text. It contains information about the entity's starting and ending indices within the text, as well as any associated formatting or reference objects. The `urt.RichTextEntity` class is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same entity in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized.

The `RichTextEntityMarshaller` class takes in a `RichTextEntity` object and returns a `urt.RichTextEntity` object. It does this by calling the constructor of `urt.RichTextEntity` and passing in the appropriate values from the input `RichTextEntity`. The `referenceObjectMarshaller` and `richTextFormatMarshaller` objects are injected into the class via constructor injection and are used to marshal the `ref` and `format` fields of the `RichTextEntity` object, respectively.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val richTextEntity = RichTextEntity(
  fromIndex = 0,
  toIndex = 5,
  ref = Some(ReferenceObject("123")),
  format = Some(RichTextFormat(bold = true))
)

val marshaller = new RichTextEntityMarshaller(
  referenceObjectMarshaller = new ReferenceObjectMarshaller(),
  richTextFormatMarshaller = new RichTextFormatMarshaller()
)

val urtRichTextEntity = marshaller(richTextEntity)
```

In this example, a `RichTextEntity` object is created with a starting index of 0, an ending index of 5, a reference object with an ID of "123", and bold formatting. The `RichTextEntityMarshaller` is then instantiated with two marshaller objects, and the `RichTextEntity` object is passed to it. The resulting `urt.RichTextEntity` object is then stored in `urtRichTextEntity`. This object can then be serialized and sent over the wire or stored in a database.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a marshaller for a RichTextEntity object and converts it into a thriftscala RichTextEntity object. It uses two other marshallers to convert the reference object and rich text format.
   
2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they injected?
   - This code has two dependencies, ReferenceObjectMarshaller and RichTextFormatMarshaller, which are injected using the @Inject annotation. The class is also annotated with @Singleton, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application.
   
3. What is the expected input and output of the apply() method?
   - The apply() method takes a RichTextEntity object as input and returns a thriftscala RichTextEntity object. The input object contains fromIndex, toIndex, ref, and format fields, which are used to populate the corresponding fields in the output object. The ref and format fields are optional and may be null.
