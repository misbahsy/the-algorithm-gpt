The `ResponseSizeAlert` class is a part of the alerting system for the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class triggers an alert when the specified percentile of requests with empty responses is beyond the `ThroughputPredicate` threshold for a configured amount of time. 

The `ResponseSizeAlert` class takes in several parameters including `notificationGroup`, `percentile`, `warnPredicate`, `criticalPredicate`, and `runbookLink`. The `notificationGroup` parameter specifies the group to which the alert notification should be sent. The `percentile` parameter specifies the percentile of requests with empty responses that should trigger the alert. The `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` parameters are instances of the `ThroughputPredicate` class, which is used to determine if the alert should be triggered based on the throughput of requests. The `runbookLink` parameter is an optional link to a runbook that provides instructions on how to handle the alert.

The `ResponseSizeAlert` class extends the `Alert` class, which provides additional functionality for handling alerts. The `metricSuffix` and `alertType` properties are overridden in the `ResponseSizeAlert` class to provide specific values for this type of alert. The `require` statements are used to ensure that the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds are greater than or equal to zero.

Here is an example of how the `ResponseSizeAlert` class might be used in the larger project:

```
val notificationGroup = NotificationGroup("my-group")
val percentile = Percentile(95)
val warnPredicate = ThroughputPredicate(100, 10.seconds)
val criticalPredicate = ThroughputPredicate(50, 10.seconds)
val runbookLink = Some("http://my-runbook.com")

val responseSizeAlert = ResponseSizeAlert(notificationGroup, percentile, warnPredicate, criticalPredicate, runbookLink)
```

In this example, a `ResponseSizeAlert` instance is created with a notification group of "my-group", a percentile of 95, a warn predicate of 100 requests per 10 seconds, a critical predicate of 50 requests per 10 seconds, and a runbook link of "http://my-runbook.com". This alert will trigger when the 95th percentile of requests with empty responses exceeds the warn or critical thresholds for the specified amount of time. The alert notification will be sent to the "my-group" notification group.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ResponseSizeAlert` case class?
- The `ResponseSizeAlert` case class triggers an alert when the specified percentile of requests with empty responses exceeds the `ThroughputPredicate` threshold for a configured amount of time.

2. What is the significance of the `ThroughputPredicate` class?
- The `ThroughputPredicate` class is used as a threshold for triggering the `ResponseSizeAlert` and is required to be specified as both a `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate`.

3. What are the requirements for the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds?
- Both the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds must be greater than or equal to 0, as specified in the `require` statements in the code.
