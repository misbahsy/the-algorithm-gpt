The `SelectorStep` class is a step in the product mixing pipeline of the Twitter product mixer. It takes a list of candidates with details and a set of selectors, and executes the selectors to determine which candidates should be selected. The step is implemented as a case class that takes a `SelectorExecutor` as a parameter. 

The `SelectorStep` class is a generic class that takes two type parameters: `Query` and `State`. `Query` is the type of the `PipelineQuery` domain model, and `State` is the pipeline state domain model that has a query and candidates with details. The `SelectorStep` class extends the `Step` trait, which is a trait that defines the behavior of a step in the pipeline. 

The `SelectorStep` class has three methods: `adaptInput`, `arrow`, and `updateState`. The `adaptInput` method takes the pipeline state and the list of selectors as input and returns an instance of `SelectorExecutor.Inputs`. The `arrow` method takes the list of selectors and an `Executor.Context` as input and returns an `Arrow` that maps `SelectorExecutor.Inputs` to `SelectorExecutorResult`. The `updateState` method takes the pipeline state, the `SelectorExecutorResult`, and the list of selectors as input and returns an updated pipeline state. 

The `SelectorStep` class also has an `isEmpty` method that returns `false`. This method is used to determine whether the step should be skipped if the list of selectors is empty. In the case of the `SelectorStep`, an empty list of selectors means that all candidates should be selected. 

Overall, the `SelectorStep` class is an important step in the product mixing pipeline of the Twitter product mixer. It takes a list of candidates with details and a set of selectors, and executes the selectors to determine which candidates should be selected. The step is implemented as a case class that takes a `SelectorExecutor` as a parameter. The `SelectorStep` class has several methods that are used to adapt the input, execute the selectors, and update the pipeline state.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a selection step in a pipeline for selecting candidates based on given selectors. It is part of the product_mixer core pipeline step selector package.

2. What are the input and output types for this step?
- The input types are a state object containing a query and candidates with details, and a sequence of selectors. The output type is a SelectorExecutorResult object.

3. What is the significance of the isEmpty method in this code?
- The isEmpty method is used to determine if an empty selection list drops all candidates. In this case, it always returns false, indicating that an empty selection list does not drop any candidates.
