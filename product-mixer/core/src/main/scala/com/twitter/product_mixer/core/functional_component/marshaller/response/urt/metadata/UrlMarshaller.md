The `UrlMarshaller` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for marshalling `Url` objects into `urt.Url` objects. This class is used to convert `Url` objects into a format that can be easily consumed by other parts of the project.

The `UrlMarshaller` class is a singleton class that is injected with two dependencies: `UrlTypeMarshaller` and `UrtEndpointOptionsMarshaller`. These dependencies are used to convert `Url` objects into their respective types and endpoint options.

The `apply` method of the `UrlMarshaller` class takes a `Url` object as input and returns a `urt.Url` object. The `urt.Url` object is created using the `urt.Url` case class and the values of the `Url` object. The `urlType` field of the `urt.Url` object is set using the `urlTypeMarshaller` dependency, which converts the `urlType` field of the `Url` object into its respective type. The `url` field of the `urt.Url` object is set to the `url` field of the `Url` object. The `urtEndpointOptions` field of the `urt.Url` object is set using the `urtEndpointOptionsMarshaller` dependency, which converts the `urtEndpointOptions` field of the `Url` object into its respective endpoint options.

Here is an example of how the `UrlMarshaller` class can be used:

```scala
val url = Url("type", "http://example.com", Some(UrtEndpointOptions("option1", "option2")))
val urlMarshaller = new UrlMarshaller(new UrlTypeMarshaller, new UrtEndpointOptionsMarshaller)
val urtUrl = urlMarshaller(url)
```

In this example, a `Url` object is created with a `urlType` of "type", a `url` of "http://example.com", and `urtEndpointOptions` of "option1" and "option2". The `UrlMarshaller` object is then created with its dependencies, and the `apply` method is called with the `Url` object as input. The resulting `urt.Url` object is stored in the `urtUrl` variable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   This code is a marshaller for a response object called Url in the context of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It maps the Url object to a thriftscala Url object.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   This code depends on two other marshallers called UrlTypeMarshaller and UrtEndpointOptionsMarshaller, which are injected into the class through its constructor.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply method?
   The apply method takes an object of type Url as input and returns an object of type urt.Url. It maps the fields of the Url object to the corresponding fields of the urt.Url object.
