The `ProductPipelineCandidateSource` class is a candidate source for getting candidates from a different product within the same Product Mixer-based service. This is useful when calling a RecommendationPipeline-based Product from a MixerPipeline-based Product. In this scenario, the two Products can remain independent and encapsulated within the Product Mixer service, which provides future optionality for migrating one of the two products into a new Product Mixer-based service based on the scaling needs.

The class is defined as an abstract class with four type parameters: `Query`, `MixerRequest`, `ProductPipelineResult`, and `Candidate`. `Query` is a `PipelineQuery` from the originating product. `MixerRequest` is the `Request` domain model for the Product Mixer service. `ProductPipelineResult` is the return type of the candidate source product. `Candidate` is the type of candidate returned by this candidate source, which is typically extracted from within the `ProductPipelineResult` type.

The class extends the `CandidateSource` trait and overrides its `apply` method. The `apply` method takes a `Query` parameter and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[Candidate]`. The method transforms the `Query` into a `MixerRequest` using the `pipelineRequestTransformer` method and then builds the `Params` using the `paramsBuilder` method. It then gets the `ProductPipeline` from the `ProductPipelineRegistry` using the `getProductPipeline` method and processes the `ProductPipelineRequest` using the `process` method. Finally, it transforms the `ProductPipelineResult` into a `Seq[Candidate]` using the `productPipelineResultTransformer` method and returns the result.

The `ProductPipelineCandidateSource` class is used in the larger project to provide a way to get candidates from a different product within the same Product Mixer-based service. It is a part of the candidate source product pipeline and is used to extract candidates from the product pipeline result. The class is designed to be extensible and can be used with different types of `Query`, `MixerRequest`, `ProductPipelineResult`, and `Candidate`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines an abstract class for a candidate source that retrieves candidates from a different product within the same Product Mixer-based service. It is used when calling a RecommendationPipeline-based Product from a MixerPipeline-based Product. It fits into the larger project by providing future optionality for migrating one of the two products into a new Product Mixer-based service based on the scaling needs.

2. What are the input and output types for this abstract class?
- The input types are a PipelineQuery from the originating Product, a Request domain model for the Product Mixer service (with a TypeTag), and the return type of the candidate source Product (also with a TypeTag). The output type is a sequence of Candidates.

3. What is the purpose of the apply() method and how does it work?
- The apply() method takes a Query as input and transforms it into a MixerRequest using the pipelineRequestTransformer method. It then uses a ParamsBuilder to build the necessary parameters for the request. The ProductPipelineRegistry is used to retrieve the appropriate ProductPipeline based on the request's product, and the process() method is called on the pipeline with a ProductPipelineRequest. The resulting ProductPipelineResult is then transformed into a sequence of Candidates using the productPipelineResultTransformer method and returned as a Stitch.
