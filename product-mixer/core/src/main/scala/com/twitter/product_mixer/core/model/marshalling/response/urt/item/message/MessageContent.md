This code defines three case classes that represent different types of message content for a response in the context of the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. The `MessageContent` trait is sealed, meaning that all implementations of this trait must be defined in this file. 

The first case class, `InlinePromptMessageContent`, represents a message with an inline prompt. It takes in several parameters, including `headerText` (a string representing the header text of the message), `bodyText` (an optional string representing the body text of the message), `primaryButtonAction` and `secondaryButtonAction` (optional `MessageTextAction` objects representing the actions associated with the primary and secondary buttons, respectively), `headerRichText` and `bodyRichText` (optional `RichText` objects representing the rich text associated with the header and body of the message, respectively), `socialContext` (an optional `SocialContext` object representing the social context associated with the message), and `userFacepile` (an optional `UserFacepile` object representing the user facepile associated with the message).

The second case class, `HeaderImagePromptMessageContent`, represents a message with a header image prompt. It takes in several parameters, including `headerImage` (a `MessageImage` object representing the header image of the message), `headerText` (an optional string representing the header text of the message), `bodyText` (an optional string representing the body text of the message), `primaryButtonAction` and `secondaryButtonAction` (optional `MessageTextAction` objects representing the actions associated with the primary and secondary buttons, respectively), `action` (an optional `MessageAction` object representing the action associated with the message), `headerRichText` and `bodyRichText` (optional `RichText` objects representing the rich text associated with the header and body of the message, respectively).

The third case class, `CompactPromptMessageContent`, represents a compact message with a prompt. It takes in several parameters, including `headerText` (a string representing the header text of the message), `bodyText` (an optional string representing the body text of the message), `primaryButtonAction` and `secondaryButtonAction` (optional `MessageTextAction` objects representing the actions associated with the primary and secondary buttons, respectively), `action` (an optional `MessageAction` object representing the action associated with the message), `headerRichText` and `bodyRichText` (optional `RichText` objects representing the rich text associated with the header and body of the message, respectively).

These case classes can be used to represent different types of message content in the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. For example, they could be used to define the content of messages sent to users in response to certain actions or events. The different types of message content allow for flexibility in the design of these messages, as different types of messages may require different types of content. Overall, this code provides a framework for defining and working with message content in the context of The Algorithm from Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MessageContent` trait and its three case classes?
- The `MessageContent` trait and its three case classes define different types of message content that can be included in a response from the product mixer core model. Each case class represents a specific type of message content with its own set of properties.

2. What is the role of the `SocialContext` and `UserFacepile` classes?
- The `SocialContext` class is used to provide metadata about the social context of a message, such as the number of likes or retweets. The `UserFacepile` class is used to display a group of user profile pictures in a message.

3. What is the difference between the `InlinePromptMessageContent` and `CompactPromptMessageContent` case classes?
- The `InlinePromptMessageContent` case class includes an optional `userFacepile` property and is likely used for messages that are displayed inline with other content. The `CompactPromptMessageContent` case class does not include a `userFacepile` property and is likely used for messages that are displayed in a more compact format.
