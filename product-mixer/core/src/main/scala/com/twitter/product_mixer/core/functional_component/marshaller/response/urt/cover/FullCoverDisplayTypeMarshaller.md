The `FullCoverDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling a `FullCoverDisplayType` object into a `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` object. 

The `FullCoverDisplayType` object is an enum that represents the different types of cover display options available. The `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same concept in the Thrift protocol. 

The `apply` method takes a `FullCoverDisplayType` object as input and returns a `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` object. The method uses pattern matching to determine which type of cover display option is being used and returns the corresponding `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` object. 

This class is used in the larger project to convert between the `FullCoverDisplayType` object used internally and the `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` object used in the Thrift protocol. This conversion is necessary when communicating with other services that use the Thrift protocol. 

Example usage:

```
val marshaller = new FullCoverDisplayTypeMarshaller()
val halfCoverDisplayType = CoverFullCoverDisplayType
val fullCoverDisplayType = marshaller(halfCoverDisplayType)
``` 

In this example, a new instance of the `FullCoverDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is created. The `halfCoverDisplayType` variable is set to the `CoverFullCoverDisplayType` enum value. The `marshaller` instance is then used to convert the `halfCoverDisplayType` value into a `fullCoverDisplayType` value using the `apply` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a `FullCoverDisplayType` object to a `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` object. It is used in the `com.twitter.product_mixer` project for handling responses related to cover display types.

2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.

3. What is the purpose of the `match` statement in the `apply` method?
   - The `match` statement is used to pattern match on the `halfCoverDisplayType` parameter and return the corresponding `urt.FullCoverDisplayType` value. In this case, if `halfCoverDisplayType` is of type `CoverFullCoverDisplayType`, then the method returns `urt.FullCoverDisplayType.Cover`.
