The `MediaMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `Media` object from the core model into a `urt.Media` object from the `timelines.render` package. This conversion is necessary for the media data to be properly displayed in the user's timeline.

The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It is also injected with four other marshaller classes: `MediaEntityMarshaller`, `MediaKeyMarshaller`, `RectMarshaller`, and `AspectRatioMarshaller`.

The `apply` method takes a `Media` object as input and returns a `urt.Media` object. It maps the fields of the `Media` object to the corresponding fields of the `urt.Media` object using the injected marshaller classes. Specifically, it maps the `mediaEntity`, `mediaKey`, `imagePossibleCropping`, and `aspectRatio` fields.

Here is an example usage of the `MediaMarshaller` class:

```
val media = Media(
  mediaEntity = Some(MediaEntity(...)),
  mediaKey = Some(MediaKey(...)),
  imagePossibleCropping = Some(Seq(Rect(...), Rect(...))),
  aspectRatio = Some(AspectRatio(...))
)

val mediaMarshaller = new MediaMarshaller(
  new MediaEntityMarshaller(),
  new MediaKeyMarshaller(),
  new RectMarshaller(),
  new AspectRatioMarshaller()
)

val urtMedia = mediaMarshaller(media)
```

In this example, a `Media` object is created with some sample data. Then, a new instance of `MediaMarshaller` is created with the necessary injected marshaller classes. Finally, the `apply` method is called with the `Media` object as input, returning a `urt.Media` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that marshals a `Media` object into a `urt.Media` object. It uses several other marshaller classes to convert the different fields of the `Media` object into the corresponding fields of the `urt.Media` object.

2. What are the dependencies of this class and how are they injected?
   - This class has four dependencies: `MediaEntityMarshaller`, `MediaKeyMarshaller`, `RectMarshaller`, and `AspectRatioMarshaller`. They are injected into the class constructor using the `@Inject` annotation and the class is marked as a `@Singleton`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
   - The `apply` method takes a `Media` object as input and returns a `urt.Media` object. It maps the fields of the `Media` object to the corresponding fields of the `urt.Media` object using the marshaller classes. The returned `urt.Media` object may have some fields set to `None` if the corresponding fields in the `Media` object are not present.
