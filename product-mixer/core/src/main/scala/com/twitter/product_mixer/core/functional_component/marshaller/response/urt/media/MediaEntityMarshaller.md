The `MediaEntityMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling different types of media entities into a unified format that can be used by other components in the larger project. This class takes in a `MediaEntity` object and returns a `urt.MediaEntity` object from the `timelines.render` package.

The `MediaEntity` object can be one of three types: `TweetMedia`, `BroadcastId`, or `Image`. Depending on the type of the input object, the appropriate marshaller is called to convert the object into a `urt.MediaEntity` object.

For `TweetMedia` objects, the `TweetMediaMarshaller` is used to convert the object into a `urt.MediaEntity.TweetMedia` object. For `BroadcastId` objects, the `BroadcastIdMarshaller` is used to convert the object into a `urt.MediaEntity.BroadcastId` object. For `Image` objects, the `ImageVariantMarshaller` is used to convert the image into a `urt.MediaEntity.Image` object.

This class is used in the larger project to ensure that all media entities are in a consistent format that can be easily used by other components. For example, if a component needs to display a media entity, it can simply call the `MediaEntityMarshaller` with the appropriate object and receive a `urt.MediaEntity` object that can be easily rendered.

Example usage:

```
val mediaEntity = MediaEntity(...)
val mediaEntityMarshaller = new MediaEntityMarshaller(...)
val urtMediaEntity = mediaEntityMarshaller(mediaEntity)
// use urtMediaEntity in other components
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for media entities used in Twitter's product mixer. It converts a `MediaEntity` object into a `urt.MediaEntity` object based on its type.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including `TweetMediaMarshaller`, `BroadcastIdMarshaller`, `ImageVariantMarshaller`, `TweetMedia`, `BroadcastId`, `Image`, `MediaEntity`, and `urt.MediaEntity`. These are all imported at the beginning of the file.
3. Why is the `MediaEntityMarshaller` class annotated with `@Singleton` and `@Inject`?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor parameters that should be automatically injected by a dependency injection framework.
