The `CandidateSourceExecutor` class is responsible for executing a `BaseCandidateSource` and transforming the results using a `BaseCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer` and a `CandidatePipelineResultsTransformer`. It also uses a `CandidateFeatureTransformer` to optionally extract features from the result in parallel. The class handles `UnexpectedCandidateResult` pipeline failures returned from `CandidatePipelineResultsTransformer` by removing those candidates from the result.

The `arrow` method takes in a `BaseCandidateSource`, a `BaseCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer`, a `CandidatePipelineResultsTransformer`, a sequence of `CandidateFeatureTransformer`, and an `Executor.Context`. It returns an `Arrow` that takes in a `PipelineQuery` and returns a `CandidateSourceExecutorResult`. The `CandidateSourceExecutorResult` contains a sequence of `FetchedCandidateWithFeatures`, which is a `Candidate` with its extracted features.

The `ErrorHandling` object is used to silently drop `UnexpectedCandidateResult` pipeline failures. It is used in the `candidatesResultArrow` to collect the transformed results and their features and remove any `UnexpectedCandidateResult` pipeline failures.

Overall, the `CandidateSourceExecutor` class is a key component in the larger project that handles the execution and transformation of candidate sources. It allows for parallel feature extraction and handles pipeline failures to ensure that only valid candidates are returned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a `CandidateSourceExecutor` class that executes a `BaseCandidateSource` using a `BaseCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer` and a `CandidatePipelineResultsTransformer`, and optionally extracts features from the result using a `CandidateFeatureTransformer`. It handles unexpected candidate results by removing them from the result.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `arrow` method?
- The `arrow` method takes in a `BaseCandidateSource`, a `BaseCandidatePipelineQueryTransformer`, a `CandidatePipelineResultsTransformer`, a sequence of `CandidateFeatureTransformer`s, and an `Executor.Context`. It returns an `Arrow` that takes in a `PipelineQuery` and produces a `CandidateSourceExecutorResult`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ErrorHandling` object?
- The `ErrorHandling` object is used to silently drop `UnexpectedCandidateResult` errors and return the candidate and feature map as a tuple.
