[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/model/marshalling/request/ProductContext.scala)

This code defines two traits, `ProductContext` and `HasProductContext`, which are used for marshalling requests in the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `ProductContext` trait does not contain any methods or properties, but it serves as a marker interface that can be extended by other classes or traits to indicate that they are related to a product context. A product context is a set of information that describes the context in which a product is being used or requested. 

The `HasProductContext` trait defines a single method, `productContext`, which returns an optional `ProductContext`. This trait can be mixed in with other classes or traits that need to access the product context. By making the `productContext` method optional, it allows for cases where a product context may not be available or relevant. 

For example, in the larger project, there may be a class that represents a request for a product, and this class may extend the `ProductContext` trait to indicate that it is related to a product context. Additionally, this class may mix in the `HasProductContext` trait to provide access to the product context. 

```scala
class ProductRequest extends ProductContext with HasProductContext {
  // other properties and methods
  override def productContext: Option[ProductContext] = Some(this)
}
```

Overall, this code provides a foundation for handling product contexts in the larger project, allowing for greater flexibility and extensibility in handling requests for products.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProductContext` trait?
   - The `ProductContext` trait is likely used to define a context for a product in the `com.twitter.product_mixer` project.
2. What is the purpose of the `HasProductContext` trait?
   - The `HasProductContext` trait likely provides a way for classes to indicate that they have a `productContext` property, which is an optional instance of `ProductContext`.
3. How is the `ProductContext` trait used in the rest of the project?
   - Without more context, it is difficult to determine how the `ProductContext` trait is used in the rest of the project. It is possible that it is used as a parameter or return type in other methods or classes.
