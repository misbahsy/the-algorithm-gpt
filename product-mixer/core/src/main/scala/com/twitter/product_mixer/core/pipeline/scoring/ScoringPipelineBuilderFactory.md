The `ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of `ScoringPipelineBuilder`, which is a class that builds a pipeline for scoring candidates in a product mixer system. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to create instances of `ScoringPipelineBuilder` with the necessary dependencies injected.

The `ScoringPipelineBuilder` is a generic class that takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Candidate`. `Query` is a type that extends `PipelineQuery`, which is a trait that defines methods for querying a pipeline. `Candidate` is a type that extends `UniversalNoun[Any]`, which is a trait that defines methods for accessing and manipulating candidate data.

The `ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory` class has a single method called `get`, which returns an instance of `ScoringPipelineBuilder` with the necessary dependencies injected. The method takes no arguments and returns a `ScoringPipelineBuilder` instance.

The dependencies injected into the `ScoringPipelineBuilder` instance are `gateExecutor`, `selectorExecutor`, `candidateFeatureHydratorExecutor`, and `statsReceiver`. These dependencies are all classes that are responsible for different parts of the pipeline. `gateExecutor` is responsible for filtering out candidates that do not meet certain criteria. `selectorExecutor` is responsible for selecting the best candidates based on a set of rules. `candidateFeatureHydratorExecutor` is responsible for adding additional features to the candidates. `statsReceiver` is responsible for collecting statistics about the pipeline.

Overall, this code provides a way to create instances of `ScoringPipelineBuilder` with the necessary dependencies injected. This is useful in the larger project because it allows for the creation of pipelines for scoring candidates in a product mixer system. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
val factory = new ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory(gateExecutor, selectorExecutor, candidateFeatureHydratorExecutor, statsReceiver)
val builder = factory.get[MyQuery, MyCandidate]
val pipeline = builder.build()
val result = pipeline.run(query)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a singleton class called `ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory` that provides a method to get a `ScoringPipelineBuilder` object with specific type parameters. The `ScoringPipelineBuilder` object is used to build a pipeline for scoring products based on certain criteria.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core` package, as well as the `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver` class from the `com.twitter.finagle.stats` package. It also uses the `javax.inject.Inject` and `javax.inject.Singleton` annotations.
3. What is the purpose of the `@Inject` and `@Singleton` annotations?
   - The `@Inject` annotation is used to indicate that the constructor of the `ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory` class should be used for dependency injection. The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the `ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory` class should be created and used throughout the application.
