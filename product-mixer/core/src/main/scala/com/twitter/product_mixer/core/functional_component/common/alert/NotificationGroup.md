[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/product-mixer/core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/product_mixer/core/functional_component/common/alert/NotificationGroup.scala)

The code defines two case classes, `Destination` and `NotificationGroup`, which are used to specify where alerts should be sent and how they should be routed based on their level of urgency. 

The `Destination` case class has two fields: `pagerDutyKey` and `emails`. `pagerDutyKey` is an optional string field that represents a PagerDuty key, which is used to send alerts to a PagerDuty rotation. `emails` is a sequence of strings that represents a list of email addresses to which alerts should be sent. 

The `NotificationGroup` case class has two fields: `critical` and `warn`. Each field is a `Destination` object that specifies where alerts of the corresponding level of urgency should be sent. For example, `critical` might specify a PagerDuty key for sending critical alerts to a PagerDuty rotation, while `warn` might specify a list of email addresses for sending less urgent alerts. 

This code is likely used as part of a larger system for monitoring and alerting on issues in a software application or infrastructure. By defining `Destination` and `NotificationGroup` objects, the system can easily specify where alerts should be sent based on their level of urgency. For example, a critical alert might trigger a PagerDuty notification to a dedicated on-call team, while a less urgent alert might simply send an email to a group of developers. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger system:

```scala
val criticalDest = Destination(pagerDutyKey = Some("my-pagerduty-key"))
val warnDest = Destination(emails = Seq("dev-team@example.com"))

val notificationGroup = NotificationGroup(critical = criticalDest, warn = warnDest)

// When a critical alert occurs:
sendAlert(notificationGroup.critical)

// When a less urgent alert occurs:
sendAlert(notificationGroup.warn)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Destination` case class and how is it used in the project?
- The `Destination` case class represents the destination to which alerts will be sent and can contain either a Pager Duty key or a list of emails. It is used to specify where alerts should be sent based on the severity of the alert.

2. What is the purpose of the `require` statements in the `Destination` case class?
- The `require` statements are used to validate the input parameters of the `Destination` case class. They ensure that the `pagerDutyKey` is 32 characters long, that all email addresses are valid, and that either a `pagerDutyKey` or at least one email address is provided.

3. What is the purpose of the `NotificationGroup` case class and how is it used in the project?
- The `NotificationGroup` case class maps alert levels to destinations, allowing different destinations to be specified based on the urgency of the alert. It is used to specify which `Destination` should be used for critical alerts and which should be used for warn alerts.
