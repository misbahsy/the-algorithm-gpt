The `ConfirmationDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling the `ConfirmationDisplayType` object into a `urt.ConfirmationDisplayType` object. 

The `ConfirmationDisplayType` object is an enumeration that represents the type of confirmation display that should be used in the user interface. It has two possible values: `Inline` and `BottomSheet`. 

The `ConfirmationDisplayTypeMarshaller` class has a single method called `apply` that takes a `ConfirmationDisplayType` object as input and returns a `urt.ConfirmationDisplayType` object. This method uses pattern matching to determine which value of `ConfirmationDisplayType` is being passed in and returns the corresponding `urt.ConfirmationDisplayType` value. 

This class is likely used in the larger project to convert `ConfirmationDisplayType` objects into `urt.ConfirmationDisplayType` objects for use in the user interface. For example, if the project has a form that requires confirmation from the user, the `ConfirmationDisplayType` object could be used to determine whether the confirmation should be displayed inline or in a bottom sheet. The `ConfirmationDisplayTypeMarshaller` class would then be used to convert the `ConfirmationDisplayType` object into a `urt.ConfirmationDisplayType` object that can be used by the user interface. 

Example usage:

```
val confirmationDisplayType: ConfirmationDisplayType = BottomSheet
val marshaller: ConfirmationDisplayTypeMarshaller = new ConfirmationDisplayTypeMarshaller()
val urtConfirmationDisplayType: urt.ConfirmationDisplayType = marshaller(confirmationDisplayType)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a confirmation display type used in a Twitter product mixer. It maps a local confirmation display type to a corresponding Thrift Scala confirmation display type.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including `BottomSheet`, `Inline`, `ConfirmationDisplayType`, and `urt.ConfirmationDisplayType`. It also imports classes from `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata` and `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala`.
3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
