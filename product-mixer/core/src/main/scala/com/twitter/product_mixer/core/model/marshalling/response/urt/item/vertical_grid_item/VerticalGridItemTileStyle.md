This code defines a sealed trait called `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` and two case objects that extend it: `SingleStateDefaultVerticalGridItemTileStyle` and `DoubleStateDefaultVerticalGridItemTileStyle`. 

In the context of the larger project, this code is likely used to represent different styles of tiles in a vertical grid layout. The `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` trait serves as a base type for all tile styles, while the case objects represent specific styles that can be used in the grid. 

For example, the `SingleStateDefaultVerticalGridItemTileStyle` case object may represent a tile with a single state and default styling, while the `DoubleStateDefaultVerticalGridItemTileStyle` case object may represent a tile with two states and default styling. 

This code can be used throughout the project to define and manipulate different tile styles in the vertical grid layout. For example, a method that creates a new tile in the grid may take a `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` parameter to specify the style of the tile. 

Here's an example of how this code might be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.item.vertical_grid_item._

// create a new tile with single state default style
val tile1 = new VerticalGridItem(style = SingleStateDefaultVerticalGridItemTileStyle)

// create a new tile with double state default style
val tile2 = new VerticalGridItem(style = DoubleStateDefaultVerticalGridItemTileStyle)
```

Overall, this code plays an important role in defining and managing the visual layout of the vertical grid in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` trait and its two case objects?
   - The `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` trait and its two case objects define different styles for the tiles in a vertical grid item.
2. Where is this code used within the larger project?
   - It is used in the model marshalling response for a specific type of item called a vertical grid item.
3. Are there any other possible case objects that could extend the `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` trait?
   - It is possible for other case objects to extend the `VerticalGridItemTileStyle` trait, but none are currently defined in this file.
