The `AsyncFeatureMap` class is an internal representation of an asynchronous `FeatureMap` containing `Stitch`es of `FeatureMap`s that are already running in the background. It is used to keep track of the `FeatureMap`s for `PipelineStepIdentifier`s that have not been reached yet. 

The `AsyncFeatureMap` class has a constructor that takes a map of `PipelineStepIdentifier` to a queue of tuples containing `FeatureHydratorIdentifier`, a set of `Feature`s to be hydrated, and a `Stitch` of the async `FeatureMap`. The `addAsyncFeatures` method is used to add new async features to the `AsyncFeatureMap`. It takes a `FeatureHydratorIdentifier`, a `PipelineStepIdentifier` before which the `Feature`s need to be hydrated, a set of `Feature`s to be hydrated, and a `Stitch` of the `FeatureMap`. The `hydrate` method is used to hydrate the `Feature`s for a specific `PipelineStepIdentifier`. It returns a `Some` containing a `Stitch` with a `FeatureMap` holding the `Feature`s that are supposed to be hydrated at the provided `PipelineStepIdentifier`. If there are no `Feature`s to hydrate at the provided `PipelineStepIdentifier`, it returns `None`.

The `AsyncFeatureMap` class also has a `features` method that returns the current state of the `AsyncFeatureMap` excluding the `Stitch`es. It returns a map of `PipelineStepIdentifier` to a sequence of tuples containing `FeatureHydratorIdentifier` and a set of `Feature`s. The `++` method is used to combine two `AsyncFeatureMap`s.

The `AsyncFeatureMap` class is used in the larger project to keep track of the `FeatureMap`s for `PipelineStepIdentifier`s that have not been reached yet. It is used to hydrate the `Feature`s for a specific `PipelineStepIdentifier`. The `AsyncFeatureMap` class is also used to combine two `AsyncFeatureMap`s. 

Example usage:

```scala
val asyncFeatureMap1 = AsyncFeatureMap.empty
val asyncFeatureMap2 = AsyncFeatureMap.empty

val asyncFeatureMap3 = asyncFeatureMap1 ++ asyncFeatureMap2

val asyncFeatureMap4 = asyncFeatureMap3.addAsyncFeatures(
  featureHydratorIdentifier = FeatureHydratorIdentifier("featureHydrator1"),
  hydrateBefore = PipelineStepIdentifier("step1"),
  featuresToHydrate = Set(Feature("feature1", 1), Feature("feature2", "value2")),
  features = Stitch(FeatureMap(Map.empty))
)

val hydratedFeatures = asyncFeatureMap4.hydrate(PipelineStepIdentifier("step1"))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the AsyncFeatureMap class and how does it relate to the rest of the project?
- The AsyncFeatureMap class is an internal representation of an async FeatureMap containing Stitches of FeatureMaps which are already running in the background. It keeps track of the FeatureHydratorIdentifier and the Set of Features which will be hydrated for each Stitch of a FeatureMap it's given. It relates to the rest of the project by being used in the pipeline and component classes.
2. What is the difference between the addAsyncFeatures and hydrate methods?
- The addAsyncFeatures method adds async features to the AsyncFeatureMap by providing the FeatureHydratorIdentifier, hydrateBefore PipelineStepIdentifier, featuresToHydrate Set of Features, and a Stitch of the FeatureMap. The hydrate method returns a Some containing a Stitch with a FeatureMap holding the Features that are supposed to be hydrated at the provided PipelineStepIdentifier if there are Features to hydrate at that identifier.
3. What is the purpose of the ++ method and how is it used?
- The ++ method is used to combine two AsyncFeatureMaps together. It takes in another AsyncFeatureMap as a parameter and returns a new AsyncFeatureMap that contains the combined asyncFeatureMaps of both AsyncFeatureMaps. It is used to merge AsyncFeatureMaps from different sources.
