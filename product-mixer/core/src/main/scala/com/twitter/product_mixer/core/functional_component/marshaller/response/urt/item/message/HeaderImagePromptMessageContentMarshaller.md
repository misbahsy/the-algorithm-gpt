The `HeaderImagePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `HeaderImagePromptMessageContent` objects into `urt.MessageContent` objects. This class is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves rendering timelines or messages.

The `HeaderImagePromptMessageContent` object contains information about a message that prompts the user to take some action. It includes a header image, header text, body text, and various actions that the user can take. The `HeaderImagePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class takes this information and converts it into a `urt.MessageContent` object that can be used to render the message.

The `apply` method is the main method of this class. It takes a `HeaderImagePromptMessageContent` object as input and returns a `urt.MessageContent` object. The `urt.MessageContent` object is created using the `urt.MessageContent.HeaderImagePrompt` constructor, which takes an `urt.HeaderImagePrompt` object as input. The `urt.HeaderImagePrompt` object is created using the information from the `HeaderImagePromptMessageContent` object.

The `HeaderImagePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class depends on several other classes, including `MessageImageMarshaller`, `MessageTextActionMarshaller`, `MessageActionMarshaller`, and `RichTextMarshaller`. These classes are likely responsible for marshalling other types of objects that are used in the larger project.

Overall, the `HeaderImagePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class is an important component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It is responsible for converting `HeaderImagePromptMessageContent` objects into `urt.MessageContent` objects that can be used to render messages that prompt the user to take some action.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that marshals a specific type of message content called HeaderImagePromptMessageContent into a Thrift message content format. It uses several other marshaller classes to convert the different fields of the input message content into the corresponding fields of the Thrift message content.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code imports several other classes from different packages, including RichTextMarshaller, MessageImageMarshaller, MessageTextActionMarshaller, and MessageActionMarshaller. It also injects instances of these classes into its constructor using the @Inject annotation.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply() method?
   - The apply() method takes an instance of HeaderImagePromptMessageContent as input and returns an instance of urt.MessageContent as output. The input message content is converted into a Thrift message content format using the different marshaller classes and the corresponding fields of the Thrift message content are populated with the converted values. The resulting Thrift message content is then returned as output.
