The code defines a case class called CandidatesWithSourceFeatures that represents the results from a candidate source. It takes in two parameters: candidates, which is a sequence of candidates returned from the underlying CandidateSource, and features, which is a FeatureMap containing the features from the candidate source to merge back into the PipelineQuery FeatureMap.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to extract query level features from the response of a thrift call and add them to the PipelineQuery FeatureMap. This can be useful in a larger project where there are multiple candidate sources and each source may have its own set of features that need to be merged into the PipelineQuery FeatureMap.

Here is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:

```
val candidateSource = new SomeCandidateSource()
val candidatesWithFeatures = candidateSource.getCandidatesWithFeatures(query)
pipelineQuery.addFeatures(candidatesWithFeatures.features)
```

In this example, we create a new instance of a candidate source and call the getCandidatesWithFeatures method, passing in a query. This method returns a CandidatesWithSourceFeatures object, which we then use to add the extracted features to the PipelineQuery FeatureMap using the addFeatures method.

Overall, this code provides a way to extract and merge features from candidate sources into a larger PipelineQuery FeatureMap, which can be used to make more informed decisions in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a case class for storing results from a candidate source, along with extracted query level features. It likely fits into a larger pipeline or system for processing data.

2. What is the expected format and content of the `Candidate` type?
- The `Candidate` type is a generic parameter for the case class, so it could be any type of result returned from the candidate source. A smart developer might want to know what specific types are expected or how they should be formatted.

3. How are the features in the `FeatureMap` merged back into the `PipelineQuery` feature map?
- The code mentions that the `FeatureMap` contains features from the candidate source to merge back into the `PipelineQuery` feature map, but it doesn't specify how this merging occurs. A smart developer might want to know the details of this process.
