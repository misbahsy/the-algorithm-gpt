The `RichFeedbackBehaviorMarshaller` class is responsible for converting instances of the `RichFeedbackBehavior` class into instances of the `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior` class. This is done by pattern matching on the input `RichFeedbackBehavior` instance and creating a corresponding `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior` instance based on the type of the input.

The `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior` class is a Thrift-generated class that represents a user's feedback on a particular piece of content on Twitter. It contains various fields that represent different types of feedback, such as reporting a tweet or blocking a user.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert instances of the `RichFeedbackBehavior` class, which is used internally in the Twitter product mixer, into instances of the `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior` class, which is used in the rendering of timelines on Twitter.

This code is likely used as part of a larger system that involves rendering timelines for Twitter users. When a user interacts with a piece of content on Twitter, such as reporting a tweet or blocking a user, this interaction is represented as an instance of the `RichFeedbackBehavior` class. This instance is then passed to the `RichFeedbackBehaviorMarshaller` class, which converts it into an instance of the `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior` class. This instance is then used to render the user's timeline, which includes the feedback that the user has provided on various pieces of content.

Example usage:

```
val feedbackBehavior = RichFeedbackBehaviorReportTweet("12345")
val marshaller = new RichFeedbackBehaviorMarshaller()
val urtFeedbackBehavior = marshaller(feedbackBehavior)
// urtFeedbackBehavior is now an instance of urt.RichFeedbackBehavior.ReportTweet
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a marshaller for converting instances of `RichFeedbackBehavior` to `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior`. It solves the problem of converting between two different data types.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several classes from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata` and `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` packages. It also uses the `javax.inject` and `javax.inject.Singleton` annotations.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes an instance of `RichFeedbackBehavior` as input and returns an instance of `urt.RichFeedbackBehavior`. The input is matched against several cases to determine the appropriate output.
