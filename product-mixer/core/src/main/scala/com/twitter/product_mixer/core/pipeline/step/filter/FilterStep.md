The `FilterStep` class is a step in the pipeline of the product mixer core. It takes a list of candidates and a filter and applies the filter on the candidates in sequence, returning the final list of kept candidates to the state. 

The `FilterStep` class is a generic class that takes three type parameters: `Query`, `Candidate`, and `State`. `Query` is the type of the pipeline query domain model, `Candidate` is the type of candidates to filter, and `State` is the pipeline state domain model. 

The `FilterStep` class implements the `Step` trait, which defines the behavior of a step in the pipeline. The `Step` trait has four type parameters: `State`, `Config`, `Input`, and `Output`. `State` is the pipeline state domain model, `Config` is the configuration for the step, `Input` is the input to the step, and `Output` is the output of the step. 

The `FilterStep` class has four methods: `isEmpty`, `adaptInput`, `arrow`, and `updateState`. 

The `isEmpty` method takes a configuration for the step and returns a boolean indicating whether the configuration is empty. 

The `adaptInput` method takes the pipeline state and the configuration for the step and returns a tuple containing the pipeline query and the list of candidates with features. 

The `arrow` method takes the configuration for the step and an executor context and returns an Arrow that takes a tuple containing the pipeline query and the list of candidates with features and returns a `FilterExecutorResult`. 

The `updateState` method takes the pipeline state, the `FilterExecutorResult`, and the configuration for the step and returns the updated pipeline state. 

Here is an example of how the `FilterStep` class might be used in the larger project:

```
val filter = new Filter[Query, Candidate] {
  override def apply(query: Query, candidate: Candidate): Boolean = {
    // apply filter logic here
  }
}

val filterStep = FilterStep(filterExecutor)
val updatedState = filterStep.execute(state, Seq(filter))
``` 

In this example, a filter is defined and passed to the `FilterStep` along with a `FilterExecutor`. The `execute` method is called on the `FilterStep` with the pipeline state and the filter configuration. The `execute` method applies the filter to the candidates in the pipeline state and returns the updated pipeline state.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a candidate filter step for a pipeline in the Twitter Product Mixer project, which applies a sequence of filters to a list of candidates and returns the final kept candidates list to the pipeline state.

2. What are the input and output types of this filter step?
- The input types are a PipelineQuery domain model and a sequence of UniversalNoun candidates to filter, while the output type is a FilterExecutorResult of the same candidate type.

3. What is the role of the FilterExecutor in this code?
- The FilterExecutor is injected into the FilterStep and used to apply the sequence of filters to the input candidates, returning a FilterExecutorResult that contains the final kept candidates list.
