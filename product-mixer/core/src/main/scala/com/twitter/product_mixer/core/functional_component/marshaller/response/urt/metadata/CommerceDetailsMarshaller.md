The `CommerceDetailsMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for marshalling (converting) an instance of the `CommerceDetails` class into an instance of the `urt.CommerceDetails` class. 

The `CommerceDetails` class is a model class that contains information about a commerce product, such as its drop ID, shop V2 ID, product key, merchant ID, and product index. The `urt.CommerceDetails` class is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same information in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized.

The `CommerceDetailsMarshaller` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire application. This is a common pattern in dependency injection frameworks, where a single instance of a class is used to provide a service to multiple parts of the application.

The `apply` method of the `CommerceDetailsMarshaller` class takes an instance of the `CommerceDetails` class as input and returns an instance of the `urt.CommerceDetails` class. The method uses the input object to set the values of the corresponding fields in the output object. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val commerceDetails = CommerceDetails(
  dropId = "123",
  shopV2Id = "456",
  productKey = "789",
  merchantId = "abc",
  productIndex = 0
)

val marshaller = CommerceDetailsMarshaller()
val urtCommerceDetails = marshaller(commerceDetails)
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `CommerceDetails` class with some sample data. We then create an instance of the `CommerceDetailsMarshaller` class and use it to convert the `CommerceDetails` object into an instance of the `urt.CommerceDetails` class. The resulting object can then be serialized and sent over the wire to another part of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for CommerceDetails objects. It converts CommerceDetails objects to urt.CommerceDetails objects.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   This code relies on the CommerceDetails class from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata package and the urt.CommerceDetails class from the com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala package.

3. Why is the CommerceDetailsMarshaller class annotated with @Singleton and @Inject?
   The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of the CommerceDetailsMarshaller class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class should be instantiated and managed by a dependency injection framework.
