The `InlinePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling `InlinePromptMessageContent` objects into `urt.MessageContent` objects. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and rendering various types of messages.

The `InlinePromptMessageContent` class represents a message that contains an inline prompt, which is a message that prompts the user to take a specific action. The `InlinePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class takes an instance of `InlinePromptMessageContent` and converts it into an instance of `urt.MessageContent` that can be rendered by the application.

The `apply` method of the `InlinePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class takes an instance of `InlinePromptMessageContent` and returns an instance of `urt.MessageContent`. The `urt.MessageContent` object is created using the `urt.InlinePrompt` case class, which contains various fields that represent the different components of the inline prompt message.

The `InlinePromptMessageContent` object is used to populate the fields of the `urt.InlinePrompt` object. The `messageTextActionMarshaller`, `richTextMarshaller`, `socialContextMarshaller`, and `userFacepileMarshaller` objects are used to convert the different components of the `InlinePromptMessageContent` object into their corresponding Thrift objects.

Overall, the `InlinePromptMessageContentMarshaller` class is an important component of the larger project that is responsible for rendering messages. It takes an instance of `InlinePromptMessageContent` and converts it into a Thrift object that can be rendered by the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for a specific type of message content called InlinePromptMessageContent. It converts an instance of this class into a Thrift message content object.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on several other classes and dependencies, including MessageTextActionMarshaller, RichTextMarshaller, SocialContextMarshaller, UserFacepileMarshaller, and the ThriftScala library.
3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to specify the dependencies that should be injected into the class constructor when an instance is created.
