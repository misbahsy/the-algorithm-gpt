This code defines a case class called StratoKeyView that represents the key and view arguments of a Strato column. Strato is likely a component of a larger project related to candidate sourcing. 

The StratoKeyView case class takes two type parameters, StratoKey and StratoView, which represent the key and view types of a Strato column, respectively. The case class has two fields, key and view, which are of type StratoKey and StratoView, respectively. 

This case class can be used to create instances that represent the key and view arguments of a Strato column. For example, if we have a Strato column with a key type of String and a view type of Int, we can create an instance of StratoKeyView like this:

```
val myStratoColumn = StratoKeyView("myKey", 42)
```

This creates an instance of StratoKeyView with a key value of "myKey" and a view value of 42. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to represent the key and view arguments of a Strato column in the larger candidate sourcing project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used within the larger project?
- This code defines a case class for representing a Strato column's Key and View arguments. It is likely used within the candidate source functional component of the larger product mixer project.

2. What are the expected data types for the `StratoKey` and `StratoView` parameters?
- The data types for `StratoKey` and `StratoView` are not specified in the code snippet. It is possible that they are defined elsewhere in the project or are expected to be specified by the developer using this case class.

3. Are there any constraints or requirements for the `key` and `view` parameters?
- The code does not specify any constraints or requirements for the `key` and `view` parameters. It is possible that there are implicit constraints or requirements within the larger project, or that they are left up to the developer using this case class to define.
