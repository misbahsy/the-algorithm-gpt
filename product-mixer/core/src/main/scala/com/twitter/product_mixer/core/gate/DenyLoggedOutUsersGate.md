The code defines a gate that denies access to logged out users for a given pipeline. A gate is a component in a pipeline that controls the flow of data by either allowing or denying access to the next component in the pipeline. In this case, the gate is called `DenyLoggedOutUsersGate` and it takes a `pipelineIdentifier` as a parameter. The gate extends the `Gate` trait, which is a functional component that takes a `PipelineQuery` and returns a `Stitch[Boolean]`. 

The `shouldContinue` method is overridden to define the behavior of the gate. If the `getUserOrGuestId` method of the `PipelineQuery` object is not empty, the gate checks if the user is logged out or not using the `isLoggedOut` method of the same object. If the user is logged in, the gate returns `true` to allow access to the next component in the pipeline. If the user is logged out, the gate returns `false` to deny access. 

If the `getUserOrGuestId` method is empty, the gate throws an exception with a `PipelineFailure` object that has an `Authentication` type and a message that says that either a `userId` or a `guestId` is expected but neither was found. 

The purpose of this gate is to ensure that only logged in users have access to a given pipeline. It can be used in a larger project to protect sensitive data or functionality that should only be accessible to authenticated users. 

Example usage:

```
val pipelineQuery = PipelineQuery(userId = Some("123"), isLoggedOut = false)
val denyLoggedOutUsersGate = DenyLoggedOutUsersGate(ComponentIdentifier("myPipeline"))
val shouldContinue = denyLoggedOutUsersGate.shouldContinue(pipelineQuery).get // returns true
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a gate that denies access to logged out users for a specific pipeline in the Twitter product mixer core. It is likely part of a larger authentication or authorization system.

2. What is the expected input and output of the `shouldContinue` method?
- The `shouldContinue` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object as input and returns a `Stitch[Boolean]`. The method checks if the query has a user or guest ID and if the user is logged out, and returns a boolean indicating whether the gate should allow the query to continue.

3. What is the purpose of the `Suffix` object in the `DenyLoggedOutUsersGate` companion object?
- The `Suffix` object is a string that is appended to the pipeline identifier to create the gate identifier. This is likely used to ensure that gate identifiers are unique within the larger system.
