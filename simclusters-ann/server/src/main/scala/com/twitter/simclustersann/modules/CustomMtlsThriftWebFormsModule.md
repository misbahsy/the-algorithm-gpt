[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/simclusters-ann/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/simclustersann/modules/CustomMtlsThriftWebFormsModule.scala)

The code defines a custom module for a Thrift server that provides a web interface for querying tweet candidates using the SimClustersANNService. The module extends the MtlsThriftWebFormsModule, which provides support for mutual TLS authentication. 

The module overrides the methodOptions method to define the default query for the "getTweetCandidates" method and to specify the allowed access for this method. The default query is a SimClustersANNService.GetTweetCandidates.Args object that specifies the source embedding ID, configuration parameters, and other options for the query. The allowed access is restricted to users who belong to the "recosplat-sensitive-data-medium" and "simclusters-ann-admins" LDAP groups. 

The module also defines a custom renderer for the response of the "getTweetCandidates" method. The renderer converts the response to an HTML view that displays the tweet candidates and their scores. The HTML view includes a header, a list of tweet candidates with their scores, and a Twitter widget that displays the tweet content. 

This module can be used as a part of a larger project that provides a web interface for querying tweet candidates using the SimClustersANNService. The project may include other modules that provide additional functionality, such as authentication, authorization, caching, and logging. The project may also include a client library that provides a programmatic interface for accessing the SimClustersANNService. 

Example usage:

```scala
val server = new ThriftServer()
val module = new CustomMtlsThriftWebFormsModule[SimClustersANNService.FutureIface](server)
server.addThriftClientModule(module)
server.start()
```

This code creates a new Thrift server, adds the custom module to the server, and starts the server. The server can now handle requests for the "getTweetCandidates" method using the web interface provided by the module.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a custom module for a Thrift server that handles requests for tweet candidates using a specific scoring algorithm and embedding type. It also provides a method for rendering the tweet candidates in HTML format.

2. What are the LDAP groups used in this code and why are they important?
- The LDAP groups used in this code are "recosplat-sensitive-data-medium", "simclusters-ann-admins", and "recos-platform-admins". They are used to control access to the methods and ensure that only authorized users can make requests.

3. What is the significance of the "maxNumResults" and "maxTopTweetsPerCluster" parameters in the "sannDefaultQuery" definition?
- The "maxNumResults" parameter specifies the maximum number of tweet candidates that can be returned in a single request, while the "maxTopTweetsPerCluster" parameter specifies the maximum number of tweets to consider when scoring each cluster. These parameters help to limit the amount of data that needs to be processed and returned, improving performance and reducing resource usage.
