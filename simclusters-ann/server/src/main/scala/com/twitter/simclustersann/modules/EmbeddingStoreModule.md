The `EmbeddingStoreModule` is a module that provides a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects. These embeddings are representations of tweets and users in a high-dimensional space, where similar tweets and users are close to each other. The embeddings are generated using a variety of models and techniques, such as log-favorite-based producers and address book-based embeddings.

The module uses a `StoreBuilder` to create underlying stores for each type of embedding. The `TweetEmbeddings` and `UserEmbeddings` sets define the types of embeddings to be created, along with the specific model versions to use. For each embedding type and model version, a corresponding `ReadableStore` is created using the `StoreBuilder`. The resulting stores are then combined into a single `ReadableStore` using the `SimClustersEmbeddingStore.buildWithDecider` method.

The resulting `ReadableStore` can be used to retrieve embeddings for tweets and users, which can then be used for various purposes such as similarity search and clustering. For example, to retrieve the embedding for a tweet with ID `tweetId`, one could use the following code:

```
val embeddingStore: ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding] = ...
val tweetId: Long = ...
val embedding: Option[SimClustersEmbedding] = Await.result(embeddingStore.get(SimClustersEmbeddingId(tweetId)), Duration.Inf)
```

Overall, the `EmbeddingStoreModule` is an important component of the larger project that provides access to tweet and user embeddings, which can be used for various downstream tasks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code provides a module for building a store of SimClustersEmbedding objects, which are used for representing and clustering data in Twitter. It solves the problem of efficiently storing and accessing these embeddings.

2. What dependencies does this code have? 
- This code depends on several other libraries and modules, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, Twitter Inject, Twitter Representation Manager, and Twitter Storehaus.

3. What is the structure of the SimClustersEmbeddingStore that is being built? 
- The SimClustersEmbeddingStore is built using a StoreBuilder and contains underlying stores for different types and versions of embeddings. These underlying stores are accessed based on the type and version of the embedding being requested. The store is also built with a Decider and StatsReceiver for handling errors and collecting statistics.
