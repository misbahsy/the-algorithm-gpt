[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/simclusters-ann/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/simclustersann/candidate_source/ExperimentalApproximateCosineSimilarity.scala)

The code defines an object called ExperimentalApproximateCosineSimilarity that extends another object called ApproximateCosineSimilarity. The ExperimentalApproximateCosineSimilarity object contains a method called apply that takes in several parameters, including a source embedding, a source embedding ID, a configuration object, and two maps. The method returns a sequence of ScoredTweet objects.

The purpose of this code is to calculate the similarity scores between a source embedding and a set of candidate embeddings. The source embedding is represented by a SimClustersEmbedding object, and the candidate embeddings are represented by a set of tweet IDs. The method calculates the similarity scores by iterating through a map of tweet IDs and their corresponding scores, and then applying a normalization function to each score. The resulting scores are then sorted and returned as a sequence of ScoredTweet objects.

The code uses several Java streams to avoid materializing intermediate collections, which should improve performance. The code also includes several configuration parameters that control the maximum number of results, the minimum score threshold, and the maximum age of tweet candidates.

This code is likely used as part of a larger project that involves clustering tweets based on their similarity scores. The code may be used to identify tweets that are similar to a given tweet, and then group those tweets into clusters. The resulting clusters can then be used to identify trending topics or to recommend content to users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it differ from the original OptimizedApproximateCosineSimilarity?
- This code is a modified version of OptimizedApproximateCosineSimilarity that uses more Java streams to avoid materializing intermediate collections. Its performance is still under investigation.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the apply() function?
- The inputs of the apply() function are a source embedding, a source embedding ID, a configuration object, a function to collect candidate scores statistics, and two optional maps. The output of the function is a sequence of ScoredTweet objects.

3. What is the purpose of the Scores class and how is it used in the apply() function?
- The Scores class is used to store the score and norm values for each candidate tweet. It is used in the apply() function to calculate the scores for each candidate tweet and collect the top K tweets based on their scores.
