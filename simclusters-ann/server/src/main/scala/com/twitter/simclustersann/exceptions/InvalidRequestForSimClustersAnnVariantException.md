The code above defines a custom exception class called `InvalidRequestForSimClustersAnnVariantException`. This exception is thrown when a request with a specific model version and embedding type cannot be processed by a particular service variant. 

The class takes in four parameters: `modelVersion`, `embeddingType`, `actualServiceName`, and `expectedServiceName`. `modelVersion` and `embeddingType` are both of type `ModelVersion` and `EmbeddingType`, respectively, which are defined in another package. `actualServiceName` is a string that represents the name of the service variant that was attempted to process the request, while `expectedServiceName` is an optional string that represents the name of the service variant that was expected to process the request.

The exception message is constructed using string interpolation to include the values of the parameters. The message indicates that the request cannot be processed by the actual service variant and specifies the expected service variant. 

This exception class can be used in the larger project to handle cases where a request cannot be processed by a specific service variant. For example, if there are multiple service variants that can process requests with different model versions and embedding types, this exception can be thrown when a request is sent to the wrong service variant. 

Here is an example of how this exception can be used:

```scala
val modelVersion = ModelVersion("1.0")
val embeddingType = EmbeddingType("word2vec")
val actualServiceName = "simclusters-ann-v2"
val expectedServiceName = Some("simclusters-ann-v2-word2vec")

try {
  // send request to service variant
} catch {
  case e: InvalidRequestForSimClustersAnnVariantException =>
    println(e.getMessage)
    // handle exception
}
```

In this example, a request is sent to the `simclusters-ann-v2` service variant with model version `1.0` and embedding type `word2vec`. If the request cannot be processed by this service variant, the `InvalidRequestForSimClustersAnnVariantException` is thrown with the actual service name and the expected service name. The exception message is printed and can be used to handle the exception appropriately.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a custom exception class called `InvalidRequestForSimClustersAnnVariantException` that extends `RequestException`.

2. What are the parameters of the `InvalidRequestForSimClustersAnnVariantException` class constructor?
- The constructor takes in four parameters: `modelVersion` of type `ModelVersion`, `embeddingType` of type `EmbeddingType`, `actualServiceName` of type `String`, and `expectedServiceName` of type `Option[String]`.

3. What message is returned when an instance of `InvalidRequestForSimClustersAnnVariantException` is thrown?
- The message returned includes information about the `modelVersion`, `embeddingType`, `actualServiceName`, and `expectedServiceName` parameters passed to the constructor. It indicates that the request cannot be processed by the current service variant and specifies the expected service variant.
