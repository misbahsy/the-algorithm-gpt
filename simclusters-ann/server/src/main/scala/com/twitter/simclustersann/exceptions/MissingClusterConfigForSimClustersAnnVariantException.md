The code above defines a case class called `MissingClusterConfigForSimClustersAnnVariantException` which extends the `IllegalStateException` class. This exception is thrown when there is no cluster configuration found for a given service name in the `SimClustersAnnVariant` algorithm. 

The `SimClustersAnnVariant` algorithm is likely a part of a larger project that involves clustering similar items or entities. The algorithm may use a configuration file to specify the parameters for clustering, such as the similarity threshold or the number of clusters to generate. If the configuration file is missing or does not contain the necessary information for a specific service name, this exception will be thrown.

This exception can be caught and handled in the code that calls the `SimClustersAnnVariant` algorithm. For example, if the algorithm is being used to cluster tweets, the code may look like this:

```
try {
  val tweetClusters = SimClustersAnnVariant.clusterTweets(tweetData, "twitter")
} catch {
  case e: MissingClusterConfigForSimClustersAnnVariantException =>
    println(s"Error clustering tweets: ${e.getMessage}")
}
```

In this example, the `clusterTweets` method is called with the tweet data and the service name "twitter". If the configuration for the "twitter" service is missing, the `MissingClusterConfigForSimClustersAnnVariantException` will be thrown and caught in the `catch` block. The error message will be printed to the console, allowing the user to take appropriate action.

Overall, this code is an important part of the error handling mechanism for the `SimClustersAnnVariant` algorithm. It ensures that the algorithm can only be run with valid configuration files, and provides a clear error message if something goes wrong.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a case class for an exception that is thrown when no cluster configuration is found for a specific service in the SimClustersAnn algorithm.

2. What input does this code require?
   - This code requires a string parameter `sannServiceName` which represents the name of the service for which the cluster configuration is missing.

3. How is this code used in the overall SimClustersAnn algorithm?
   - This code is used to handle the scenario where a required cluster configuration is missing for a specific service in the SimClustersAnn algorithm. It allows the algorithm to gracefully handle this error and provide a meaningful error message to the user.
