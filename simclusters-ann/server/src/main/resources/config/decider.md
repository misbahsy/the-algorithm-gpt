This code defines a set of configuration values for enabling or disabling the read traffic to various embeddings used in The Algorithm from Twitter project. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to control the availability of different embeddings for different use cases. 

The code defines a set of variables, each representing a specific embedding type, such as tweet embeddings, entity embeddings, knownFor embeddings, and interestedIn embeddings. For each embedding type, there are multiple variables representing different models and versions of the embeddings. 

Each variable has a comment explaining its purpose and a default availability value. The availability value is a percentage value that determines the proportion of read traffic that is allowed for the corresponding embedding type and model. A value of 0 means that all requests for that embedding type and model will return an empty response. A value of 10000 means that all requests will be allowed. 

For example, the variable `enable_LogFavBasedTweet_Model20m145k2020` controls the availability of tweet embeddings based on log-favorites. The comment explains that this variable enables read traffic to this embedding type and model from 0% to 100%. 

This code can be used to fine-tune the availability of different embeddings based on the specific use case. For example, if a particular use case does not require a certain type of embedding, it can be disabled to reduce the load on the system. On the other hand, if a particular use case requires a certain type of embedding, its availability can be increased to ensure that the requests are served efficiently. 

Overall, this code provides a way to control the availability of different embeddings used in The Algorithm from Twitter project, which can help optimize the performance of the system based on specific use cases.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines the availability of various embeddings for different models and versions, and specifies the proportion of requests that are forwarded as dark traffic to the proxy.

2. What are the different types of embeddings being enabled/disabled?
- The different types of embeddings being enabled/disabled include tweet embeddings, entity embeddings, knownFor embeddings, and interestedIn embeddings.

3. What is the significance of the "default_availability" value?
- The "default_availability" value specifies the percentage of read traffic that is enabled for a particular embedding type, model, and version. A value of 0 means that all requests will return EMPTY, while a value of 10000 means that all requests will be enabled.
