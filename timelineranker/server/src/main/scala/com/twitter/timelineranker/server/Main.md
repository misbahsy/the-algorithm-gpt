The `TimelineRankerServer` class is the main entry point for the Timeline Ranker service. It extends `TwitterServer`, which is a utility class provided by the Finagle library that makes it easy to create a Finagle server. The `TimelineRankerServer` class is responsible for setting up the server, configuring it, and starting it.

The `TimelineRankerServer` class defines a `main` method that is called when the server is started. The `main` method does the following:

1. Parses the command line arguments using the `TimelineRankerFlags` class.
2. Creates a `RuntimeConfigurationImpl` object that encapsulates the configuration of the server.
3. Creates a `TimelineRankerBuilder` object that is responsible for building the `TimelineRanker` service.
4. Creates two Thrift servers, one that uses the binary Thrift protocol and one that uses the compact Thrift protocol.
5. Binds the Thrift servers to the specified ports.
6. Starts the servers and waits for them to finish.

The `TimelineRankerServer` class uses several Finagle filters to handle various aspects of the server's behavior. These filters include:

- `MtlsServerSessionTrackerFilter`: This filter tracks the MTLS sessions for the server.
- `LoggingMDCFilter`: This filter adds logging context to the server's log messages.
- `TraceIdMDCFilter`: This filter adds trace ID context to the server's log messages.
- `ThriftMDCFilter`: This filter adds Thrift context to the server's log messages.

The `TimelineRankerServer` class also uses the `TwitterServerThriftWebForms` class to add administrative routes to the server. These routes allow administrators to view and modify the server's configuration and state.

Overall, the `TimelineRankerServer` class is responsible for setting up and starting the Timeline Ranker service. It uses Finagle to handle the low-level details of the server's behavior, and provides a high-level interface for configuring and managing the server.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for a server that provides Thrift services for the TimelineRanker application.

2. What dependencies are being used in this code?
- The code is using various dependencies such as Finagle, Thrift, and TwitterServer.

3. What is the purpose of the `mkServer` function?
- The `mkServer` function creates a ThriftMux server with various configurations such as compression preferences, filters, and TLS settings.
