The `ReverseChronTimelineQueryContextBuilder` class is responsible for building a context object for a reverse chronological timeline query. This context object is used to provide various parameters and settings for the query, such as the maximum number of tweets to fetch, whether to filter tweets based on search metadata, and whether to backfill filtered entries.

The class takes in several dependencies, including a `Config` object, a `RuntimeConfiguration` object, and a `RequestContextBuilder` object. It also defines several constants and private variables that are used to set up the context object.

The `apply` method is the main entry point for building the context object. It takes in a `ReverseChronTimelineQuery` object, which represents the query to be executed. It then uses the `RequestContextBuilder` to build a base context object, which is used to retrieve configuration parameters from the `Config` object.

The `ReverseChronTimelineQueryContextImpl` class is then instantiated with various functions that retrieve the necessary parameters from the base context and the `RuntimeConfiguration` object. These functions are defined using the private variables and constants that were set up earlier.

Overall, this code provides a way to build a context object for a reverse chronological timeline query, which can be used to customize the query based on various parameters and settings. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```
val query = ReverseChronTimelineQuery(userId = "12345")
val builder = new ReverseChronTimelineQueryContextBuilder(config, runtimeConfig, requestContextBuilder)
val context = builder(query).get()
val result = executeReverseChronTimelineQuery(query, context)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code builds a context for a reverse chronological timeline query, which is used to retrieve tweets in reverse chronological order. It solves the problem of efficiently retrieving tweets from a user's timeline in reverse chronological order.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has external dependencies on several classes from the `com.twitter` package, including `RuntimeConfiguration`, `DeciderKey`, `FeatureValue`, `Future`, and `Config`. It also depends on a `RequestContextBuilder` class from a `com.twitter.timelineranker.parameters.util` package.

3. What are the key features of the `ReverseChronTimelineQueryContextBuilder` class?
- The `ReverseChronTimelineQueryContextBuilder` class has several key features, including the ability to retrieve configuration values from a `Config` object, the ability to build a context for a reverse chronological timeline query, and the use of several `FeatureValue` objects to calculate values based on runtime configuration settings. It also has a private method to retrieve a maximum count value from a configuration store.
