The `RecapQueryParamInitializer` class is responsible for initializing the query parameters for a `RecapQuery` object. It takes in a `Config` object and a `RuntimeConfiguration` object as parameters. The `Config` object contains configuration information for the application, while the `RuntimeConfiguration` object contains runtime configuration information.

The class extends the `FunctionArrow` class, which is a functional programming concept that represents a function that takes in one argument and returns a value. In this case, the `RecapQueryParamInitializer` class takes in a `RecapQuery` object and returns a `Future` of a `RecapQuery` object.

The `apply` method of the class takes in a `RecapQuery` object and returns a `Future` of a `RecapQuery` object. It first creates a `RequestContextBuilderImpl` object using the `requestContextFactory` property of the `configApiConfiguration` property of the `runtimeConfig` object. It then uses the `requestContextBuilder` to create a `baseContext` object using the `userId` and `deviceContext` properties of the `query` object.

Next, it uses the `baseContext` object to get the query parameters from the `config` object using the `apply` method. The `apply` method takes in the `baseContext` and `statsReceiver` properties of the `runtimeConfig` object as parameters. The `statsReceiver` property is used for collecting statistics about the application.

Finally, the `apply` method returns a copy of the `query` object with the `params` property set to the query parameters obtained from the `config` object.

This class is used in the larger project to initialize the query parameters for a `RecapQuery` object. The `RecapQuery` object is used to query a timeline and get a recap of the user's activity. The query parameters are obtained from the `config` object, which contains configuration information for the application. The `RecapQueryParamInitializer` class is used to abstract away the details of obtaining the query parameters from the `config` object and provide a simple interface for initializing the query parameters. 

Example usage:

```
val config = new Config()
val runtimeConfig = new RuntimeConfiguration()
val query = new RecapQuery(userId = "123", deviceContext = Some("mobile"))
val initializer = new RecapQueryParamInitializer(config, runtimeConfig)
val initializedQuery = initializer(query).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code initializes parameters for a RecapQuery object using a Config object and a RequestContextBuilderImpl. It likely fits into a larger project related to analyzing and ranking Twitter timelines.

2. What is the expected input and output of the apply method?
- The apply method takes in a RecapQuery object and returns a Future[RecapQuery] object. The RecapQuery object is expected to have a userId and deviceContext, and the returned RecapQuery object will have additional parameters initialized based on the Config object.

3. What is the role of the FunctionArrow class and how is it used in this code?
- The FunctionArrow class is a type of function that takes in one input and returns one output, and it is used in this code to define the apply method. The RecapQueryParamInitializer class extends FunctionArrow and overrides the apply method to initialize parameters for a RecapQuery object.
