The `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` and `ScopedCortexTweetQueryServiceClientFactory` classes are part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. These classes enable calling the Cortex tweet query service to get NSFA (Not Safe For Ads) scores on tweets. 

The `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` class has a method called `getSafeTweets` that takes in a sequence of tweet IDs and returns a future sequence of tweet IDs that are considered safe. A tweet is considered safe if the Cortex NSFA model gives it a score that is above the threshold. Both the score and the threshold are returned in a response from the `getTweetSignalByIds` endpoint. The `getSafeTweet` method is a private method that takes in a `TweetSignalRequest` and a `ModelResponseResult` and returns an optional `TweetId`. It extracts the score and threshold from the response and compares them. If the score is greater than the threshold, the tweet ID is returned. Otherwise, the tweet ID is not returned. 

The `ScopedCortexTweetQueryServiceClientFactory` class is a factory that creates instances of the `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` class. It takes in a `CortexTweetQueryService.MethodPerEndpoint` and a `StatsReceiver` and returns a new instance of the `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` class. 

Overall, these classes enable the larger project to filter out tweets that are not safe for ads. This is important for Twitter's business model, as they rely on ads for revenue. By filtering out unsafe tweets, Twitter can ensure that their advertisers' content is not associated with inappropriate or offensive content. 

Example usage:

```
val cortexClient: CortexTweetQueryService.MethodPerEndpoint = ???
val statsReceiver: StatsReceiver = ???
val factory = new ScopedCortexTweetQueryServiceClientFactory(cortexClient, statsReceiver)
val client = factory.scope(RequestScope("example"))
val tweetIds: Seq[TweetId] = Seq(TweetId(123), TweetId(456), TweetId(789))
val safeTweets: Future[Seq[TweetId]] = client.getSafeTweets(tweetIds)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` object?
- The `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` object contains a private method `getSafeTweet` that determines whether a tweet is safe based on its NSFA score and threshold.

2. What is the purpose of the `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` class?
- The `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` class enables calling the Cortex tweet query service to get NSFA scores on a list of tweets and returns a future sequence of safe tweets.

3. What is the purpose of the `ScopedCortexTweetQueryServiceClientFactory` class?
- The `ScopedCortexTweetQueryServiceClientFactory` class is a factory that creates instances of `CortexTweetQueryServiceClient` with a given `RequestScope` and `StatsReceiver`.
