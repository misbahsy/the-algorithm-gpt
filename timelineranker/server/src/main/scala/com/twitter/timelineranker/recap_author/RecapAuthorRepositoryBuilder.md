The `RecapAuthorRepositoryBuilder` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to build a repository of candidates for the Recap Author feature. The Recap Author feature is used to identify the most important authors for a given topic. 

The class extends the `CandidatesRepositoryBuilder` class and overrides some of its properties. It sets the `clientSubId` to "recap_by_author" and the `requestScope` to `RequestScopes.RecapAuthorSource`. It also sets the `followGraphDataFieldsToFetch` to a set of `SgsFollowGraphDataFields` values that include the followed user IDs, mutually following user IDs, and muted user IDs. 

The class defines two timeouts for the Earlybird service, which is used to retrieve candidate authors. The `earlybirdClient` method is used to create an Earlybird client with a request timeout of 600 milliseconds and a timeout of 650 milliseconds. The `earlybirdRealtimeCGClient` method is used to create a RealtimeCG client with the same timeouts. 

The `apply` method is used to create a `RecapAuthorRepository` object. It creates two `RecapAuthorSource` objects, one using the regular search client and one using the RealtimeCG search client. It then creates a `RecapAuthorRepository` object using these two sources. 

Overall, this class is used to build a repository of candidates for the Recap Author feature. It sets the necessary properties and creates the necessary objects to retrieve candidate authors using the Earlybird and RealtimeCG services.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class that builds a repository for a Twitter project called "The Algorithm". It sets various parameters for the repository, including the client sub ID, request scope, and follow graph data fields to fetch.

2. What is the significance of the EarlybirdService and how is it used in this code?
- EarlybirdService is a Thrift service used for search and retrieval of tweets. In this code, it is used to create an Earlybird client with specific parameters, such as request and timeout durations, and retry policy.

3. What is the purpose of the RecapAuthorRepository and how is it constructed in this code?
- The RecapAuthorRepository is the main repository for the Recap by Author feature in The Algorithm project. It is constructed in this code by creating two instances of the RecapAuthorSource class, one for the regular search client and one for the realtime CG client, and passing them to the RecapAuthorRepository constructor.
