The `LatentRepository` class is used to inject an artificial delay into an underlying repository's response to match the provided p50 and max latencies. This is useful for testing and simulating real-world scenarios where there may be latency in the system. 

The class takes in an underlying repository, which is the repository that will be used to retrieve data. It also takes in a p50 and max duration, which represent the median and maximum latency that should be simulated. The class uses a random number generator to generate a random value between 0 and 1, which is used to calculate the sleep time. The sleep time is calculated using a formula that takes into account the p50 and max durations, as well as the random value generated. 

The `apply` method is overridden to simulate the latency. When the `apply` method is called with a query, the class generates a random value and calculates the sleep time using the formula. It then sleeps for the calculated sleep time using the `Future.sleep` method, which returns a future that is completed after the specified duration. Once the sleep time has elapsed, the underlying repository is called with the query and the result is returned as a future. 

Here is an example of how the `LatentRepository` class can be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.servo.repository.InMemoryRepository

// Create an in-memory repository with some data
val data = Map("key1" -> "value1", "key2" -> "value2")
val repository = new InMemoryRepository(data)

// Create a latent repository with a p50 of 100ms and a max of 500ms
val latentRepository = new LatentRepository(repository, Duration.fromMilliseconds(100), Duration.fromMilliseconds(500))

// Call the latent repository with a query
val result = latentRepository("key1")

// The result will be a future that is completed after a simulated latency
result.onSuccess { value => println(value) }
``` 

In this example, an in-memory repository is created with some data. A `LatentRepository` is then created with a p50 of 100ms and a max of 500ms. The `apply` method is called on the `latentRepository` with a query, which returns a future that is completed after a simulated latency. The result is then printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a LatentRepository class that injects an artificial delay into an underlying repository's response to match the provided p50 and max latencies.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the com.twitter.finagle.util.DefaultTimer, com.twitter.servo.repository.Repository, com.twitter.util.Duration, com.twitter.util.Future, com.twitter.util.Timer, and scala.util.Random libraries.

3. What is the algorithm used to calculate the sleep time in the LatentRepository class?
- The algorithm uses the provided p50 and max latencies, along with a random number, to calculate the sleep time using a mathematical formula that involves raising the p50 and max latencies to certain powers and taking their ratio.
