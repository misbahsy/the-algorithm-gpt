The `ExtendedRepliesFilter` object contains three private methods that are used to filter tweets in the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. The purpose of this object is to filter out extended replies that do not meet certain criteria. 

The first method, `isExtendedReply`, takes in a `HydratedTweet` object and a sequence of `UserId`s that represent the users that the current user follows. It returns a boolean value that indicates whether the tweet is an extended reply that is directed at a user that the current user does not follow, but the current user is the author of the tweet. 

The second method, `isNotQualifiedExtendedReply`, takes in a `HydratedTweet` object, a `UserId` object that represents the current user, a sequence of `UserId`s that represent the users that the current user follows, a set of `UserId`s that represent the users that the current user has muted, and a map of `TweetId`s to `HydratedTweet` objects that represent the source tweets. It returns a boolean value that indicates whether the tweet is a qualified extended reply. A qualified extended reply is an extended reply that is not a retweet, is directed at someone other than the current user, has a source tweet that is not a reply, is not a retweet, and is not authored by the same user. Additionally, the source tweet must not be authored by a muted user. 

The third method, `isNotValidExpandedExtendedReply`, takes in the same parameters as the second method and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the tweet is a valid expanded extended reply. A valid expanded extended reply is an extended reply that is not a retweet, is directed at someone other than the viewing user, and has an in-reply-to tweet that is not a retweet and is not authored by a muted user. 

Overall, the `ExtendedRepliesFilter` object is used to filter out extended replies that do not meet certain criteria in the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. These methods are used to ensure that only qualified and valid extended replies are included in the timeline ranking algorithm. 

Example usage:

```
val tweet: HydratedTweet = // get a hydrated tweet object
val followedUserIds: Seq[UserId] = // get a sequence of user ids that the current user follows
val mutedUserIds: Set[UserId] = // get a set of user ids that the current user has muted
val sourceTweetsById: Map[TweetId, HydratedTweet] = // get a map of tweet ids to hydrated tweet objects

val isExtendedReply = ExtendedRepliesFilter.isExtendedReply(tweet, followedUserIds)
val isNotQualifiedExtendedReply = ExtendedRepliesFilter.isNotQualifiedExtendedReply(tweet, userId, followedUserIds, mutedUserIds, sourceTweetsById)
val isNotValidExpandedExtendedReply = ExtendedRepliesFilter.isNotValidExpandedExtendedReply(tweet, viewingUserId, followedUserIds, mutedUserIds, sourceTweetsById)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines an object called `ExtendedRepliesFilter` with three private methods that filter tweets based on certain criteria. It is likely used to filter tweets in some way within the larger project, but more information is needed to determine the exact purpose.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `isNotQualifiedExtendedReply` method?
- The inputs are a `HydratedTweet` object, a `UserId`, a sequence of `UserId`s, a set of `UserId`s, and a map of `TweetId`s to `HydratedTweet`s. The output is a boolean value indicating whether the tweet is not a qualified extended reply.

3. What is the significance of the `private[util]` access modifier on the `isExtendedReply` method?
- The `private[util]` access modifier means that the method is only accessible within the `util` package. This suggests that the method is not intended to be used outside of this package and may be specific to the functionality of this package.
