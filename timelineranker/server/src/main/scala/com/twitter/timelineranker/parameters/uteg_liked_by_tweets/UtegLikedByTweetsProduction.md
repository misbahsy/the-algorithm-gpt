This code defines a set of parameters and configurations for the UtegLikedByTweets algorithm in the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure and customize the behavior of the algorithm by setting various parameters and feature switches.

The code defines a set of parameters, including integer and boolean parameters, as well as feature switches with bounded double and integer values. These parameters and feature switches can be used to control various aspects of the algorithm, such as the number of tweets to include in the network, the types of tweets to include or exclude, and the relevance of the search results.

The `UtegLikedByTweetsProduction` class uses these parameters and feature switches to create a configuration for the algorithm. It creates a `ConfigHelper` object that maps the parameters to decider keys, which are used to create decider-based boolean overrides. It also creates feature switch overrides for the boolean, bounded double, and bounded integer feature switches.

Finally, the `UtegLikedByTweetsProduction` class creates a `BaseConfig` object that combines all of the overrides and configurations into a single configuration for the algorithm. This configuration can then be used by the algorithm to customize its behavior.

Overall, this code provides a way to configure and customize the UtegLikedByTweets algorithm in the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. By setting various parameters and feature switches, users can control the behavior of the algorithm and tailor it to their specific needs.
