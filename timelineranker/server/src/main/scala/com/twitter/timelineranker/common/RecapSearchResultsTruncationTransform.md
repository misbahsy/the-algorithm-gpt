The `RecapSearchResultsTruncationTransform` class is responsible for truncating search results by score. It assumes that the search results are sorted in score-descending order unless `extraSortBeforeTruncation` is set to true. This class has two main use cases. The first use case is when `returnAllResults` is set to true, earlybird returns `(numResultsPerShard * number of shards)` results. This transform is then used to further truncate the result so that the size will be the same as when `returnAllResults` is set to false. The second use case is when we retrieve an extra number of results from earlybird, as specified in `MaxCountMultiplierParam`, so that we are left with a sufficient number of candidates after hydration and filtering. This transform will be used to get rid of extra results we ended up not using.

The `RecapSearchResultsTruncationTransform` class takes in three parameters: `extraSortBeforeTruncationGate`, `maxCountProvider`, and `statsReceiver`. The `extraSortBeforeTruncationGate` parameter is a dependency provider that returns a boolean value indicating whether to sort the search results before truncation. The `maxCountProvider` parameter is a dependency provider that returns an integer value indicating the maximum number of search results to return. The `statsReceiver` parameter is used to record statistics about the search results.

The `apply` method of the `RecapSearchResultsTruncationTransform` class takes in a `CandidateEnvelope` object and returns a `Future` of `CandidateEnvelope`. The `CandidateEnvelope` object contains the search results to be truncated. The `apply` method first sets aside results that are marked by the `isRandomTweet` field. It then sorts and truncates the search results other than the random tweet. The method then puts back the random tweet set aside previously. Finally, the method records statistics about the search results and returns the `CandidateEnvelope` object with the truncated search results.

Here is an example of how to use the `RecapSearchResultsTruncationTransform` class:

```
val transform = new RecapSearchResultsTruncationTransform(
  extraSortBeforeTruncationGate = new DependencyProvider[Boolean] {
    override def apply(query: RecapQuery): Boolean = true
  },
  maxCountProvider = new DependencyProvider[Int] {
    override def apply(query: RecapQuery): Int = 100
  },
  statsReceiver = new InMemoryStatsReceiver
)

val envelope = CandidateEnvelope(
  query = RecapQuery(),
  searchResults = Seq(
    SearchResult(
      tweetFeatures = Some(TweetFeatures(isRandomTweet = Some(true))),
      metadata = Some(SearchResultMetadata(score = Some(0.5)))
    ),
    SearchResult(
      tweetFeatures = Some(TweetFeatures(isRandomTweet = Some(false))),
      metadata = Some(SearchResultMetadata(score = Some(0.8)))
    ),
    SearchResult(
      tweetFeatures = Some(TweetFeatures(isRandomTweet = Some(false))),
      metadata = Some(SearchResultMetadata(score = Some(0.6)))
    )
  )
)

val result = Await.result(transform(envelope), Duration.Inf)
println(result.searchResults)
// Output: List(SearchResult(Some(TweetFeatures(Some(true))),Some(SearchResultMetadata(Some(0.5)))), SearchResult(Some(TweetFeatures(Some(false))),Some(SearchResultMetadata(Some(0.8)))))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a transform that truncates search results by score, with two main use cases: to further truncate the result when returnAllResults is set to true, and to get rid of extra results we ended up not using when we retrieve extra number of results from earlybird.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several packages, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.servo.util.FutureArrow`, `com.twitter.timelineranker.core.CandidateEnvelope`, `com.twitter.timelineranker.model.RecapQuery.DependencyProvider`, and `com.twitter.timelineranker.util.SearchResultUtil`.

3. What are the main steps of the transform?
- The transform first sets aside results that are marked by isRandomTweet field, then sorts and truncates searchResults other than the random tweet. It then puts back the random tweet set aside previously, and adds stats for postTruncationSize and earlybirdScoreX100. Finally, it returns the envelope with the truncated search results.
