The `SearchResultUtil` object provides utility functions for processing search results from Twitter. The object contains several methods that extract information from a `ThriftSearchResult` object, which is a data structure that represents a tweet search result. 

The `getScore` method returns the score of a search result. The score is a measure of the relevance of the tweet to the search query. 

The `isRetweet` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet is a retweet. 

The `isReply` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet is a reply. 

The `isEligibleReply` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet is an eligible reply. An eligible reply is a reply that is not a retweet. 

The `authorId` method returns the user ID of the author of the tweet. 

The `referencedTweetAuthorId` method returns the user ID of the author of the referenced tweet. 

The `isExtendedReply` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet is an extended reply. An extended reply is a reply from a followed user to a non-followed user. 

The `isInNetworkReply` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet is an in-network reply. An in-network reply is a reply from a followed user to another followed user. 

The `isOutOfNetworkRetweet` method returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet is an out-of-network retweet. An out-of-network retweet is a retweet of a tweet from a non-followed user. 

The `getSourceTweetId` method returns the ID of the source tweet. The source tweet is the original tweet that was retweeted or replied to. 

The `getRetweetSourceTweetId` method returns the ID of the source tweet if the tweet is a retweet, otherwise it returns `None`. 

The `getInReplyToTweetId` method returns the ID of the tweet that the tweet is replying to. 

The `getReplyRootTweetId` method returns the ID of the root tweet in a conversation thread. 

The `getOriginalTweetIdAndAncestorTweetIds` method returns a set of tweet IDs that includes the ID of the tweet itself, the ID of the source tweet (if the tweet is a retweet), and the ID of the root tweet in a conversation thread (if the tweet is a reply). 

These methods are useful for analyzing tweet search results and extracting relevant information. They can be used in a larger project that involves analyzing Twitter data, such as a sentiment analysis or topic modeling project. For example, the `isInNetworkReply` method could be used to filter out replies from non-followed users in a sentiment analysis project. The `getOriginalTweetIdAndAncestorTweetIds` method could be used to construct a graph of conversation threads in a topic modeling project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SearchResultUtil` object?
- The `SearchResultUtil` object provides utility functions for working with `ThriftSearchResult` objects, which are search results from Twitter's Earlybird search engine.

2. What is the difference between `isExtendedReply` and `isInNetworkReply`?
- `isExtendedReply` checks if a tweet is a reply from a followed user to a non-followed user, while `isInNetworkReply` checks if a tweet is a reply between two users that are both followed by the querying user.

3. What is the purpose of the `getOriginalTweetIdAndAncestorTweetIds` function?
- The `getOriginalTweetIdAndAncestorTweetIds` function returns a set of tweet IDs that includes the ID of the original tweet, the ID of the source tweet (for retweets), and the ID of the root tweet (for replies). It is used to de-duplicate tweet IDs when analyzing a set of search results.
