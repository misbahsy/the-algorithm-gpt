This code defines two type aliases and two objects in the `core` package object. The purpose of this code is to provide type aliases for two classes from the `configapi` package that are used in the `timelineranker` package. 

The first type alias is `FutureDependencyTransformer[-U, +V]`, which is defined as a type alias for `configapi.FutureDependencyTransformer[RecapQuery, U, V]`. This type alias is used to transform a `Future` of type `U` into a `Future` of type `V`, given a `RecapQuery`. The `RecapQuery` class is defined in the `timelineranker.model` package. 

The second type alias is `DependencyTransformer[-U, +V]`, which is defined as a type alias for `configapi.DependencyTransformer[RecapQuery, U, V]`. This type alias is used to transform a value of type `U` into a value of type `V`, given a `RecapQuery`. 

The two objects defined in this code are `FutureDependencyTransformer` and `DependencyTransformer`. These objects extend the `configapi.FutureDependencyTransformerFunctions` and `configapi.DependencyTransformerFunctions` classes, respectively. These objects provide additional functions for working with the `FutureDependencyTransformer` and `DependencyTransformer` type aliases. 

Overall, this code provides a way to transform values and futures given a `RecapQuery`. It is likely used in the larger project to transform data for use in the timeline ranking algorithm. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.timelineranker.core._

val transformer: DependencyTransformer[Int, String] = ???
val recapQuery: RecapQuery = ???

val transformedValue: String = transformer.transform(42, recapQuery)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines type aliases and objects for future and dependency transformers in the `com.twitter.timelineranker` package.

2. What is the relationship between `RecapQuery` and the transformers?
   - The transformers defined in this code use `RecapQuery` as a type parameter to transform dependencies and futures.

3. What is the `configapi` package used for?
   - The `configapi` package is imported and used to define the transformers in this code. It is likely a separate library or module that provides functionality for dependency and future transformations.
