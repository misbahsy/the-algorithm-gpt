The `FollowGraphData` class is a data structure that represents the follow graph details of a given user on Twitter. It includes information about the users that the given user follows, as well as users that follow the given user back. Additionally, it includes information about users that the given user has muted, as well as users whose retweets are muted by the given user.

The class takes in several parameters, including the ID of the given user, the IDs of users who the given user follows, a subset of followedUserIds where followed users follow back the given user, a subset of followedUserIds that the given user has muted, and a subset of followedUserIds whose retweets are muted by the given user.

The class has several properties that are computed based on the input parameters. The `filteredFollowedUserIds` property is a sequence of user IDs that the given user follows, excluding any users that the given user has muted. The `allUserIds` property is a sequence of user IDs that includes the `filteredFollowedUserIds` as well as the ID of the given user. The `inNetworkUserIds` property is a sequence of user IDs that includes the `followedUserIds` as well as the ID of the given user.

The `FollowGraphData` object includes a static property `Empty`, which is an instance of the `FollowGraphData` class with all properties set to empty values.

This class can be used in the larger project to represent the follow graph details of a user, which can be used for various purposes such as recommending new users to follow or analyzing the user's social network. For example, the `filteredFollowedUserIds` property can be used to get a list of users that the given user follows but has not muted, which can be used to recommend new users to follow. The `inNetworkUserIds` property can be used to get a list of users that are in the given user's social network, which can be used for social network analysis.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code defines a case class called FollowGraphData that stores information about a user's follow graph on Twitter, including followed users, mutually following users, and muted users. It also includes some derived properties like filteredFollowedUserIds and allUserIds. It is likely used in other parts of the project that need to analyze or manipulate Twitter follow graphs.

2. What is the significance of the Empty object in the FollowGraphData companion object?
- The Empty object is a singleton instance of FollowGraphData that represents an empty or default follow graph. It is useful for initializing or resetting follow graph data in certain parts of the project.

3. What is the difference between the followedUserIds and inNetworkUserIds properties?
- The followedUserIds property is a list of user IDs that the given user follows, while the inNetworkUserIds property is a list of user IDs that includes the given user and all users they follow. The latter is likely used to represent the entire follow network of the given user, while the former is a subset of that network.
