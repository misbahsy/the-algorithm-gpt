The `RecapAuthorRepository` class is a repository of recap author results for the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. It takes in two `RecapAuthorSource` objects, one for real-time results and one for non-real-time results. 

The `get` method takes in a `RecapQuery` object and returns a `Future` of `CandidateTweetsResult`. It checks if the `enableRealtimeCGProvider` is true for the given query, and if so, it returns the result from the real-time source. Otherwise, it returns the result from the non-real-time source. 

The `get` method is also overloaded to take in a sequence of `RecapQuery` objects and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `CandidateTweetsResult`. It uses the `Future.collect` method to asynchronously collect the results of each query using the `get` method. 

Overall, this class provides a way to retrieve recap author results from either a real-time or non-real-time source depending on the query. It can be used in the larger project to provide different levels of result accuracy and speed depending on the needs of the user. 

Example usage:
```
val repo = new RecapAuthorRepository(nonRealTimeSource, realTimeSource)
val query = RecapQuery(...)
val result = repo.get(query)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a repository for recap author results and provides methods for retrieving these results from an underlying source. It solves the problem of efficiently retrieving and caching recap author results.

2. What is the role of the `DependencyProvider` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `DependencyProvider` class is used to retrieve a parameter value (`EnableEarlybirdRealtimeCgMigrationParam`) and determine whether to use the `realtimeCGSource` or `source` to retrieve the `CandidateTweetsResult`. It is used in the `get` method to conditionally select the appropriate source.

3. Why does the `get` method return a `Future` and what does this imply about the method's execution?
- The `get` method returns a `Future` because the retrieval of `CandidateTweetsResult` may be an asynchronous operation that takes some time to complete. This implies that the method's execution may not be immediate and that the result will be available at some point in the future.
