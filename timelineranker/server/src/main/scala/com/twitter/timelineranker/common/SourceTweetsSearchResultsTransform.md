The `SourceTweetsSearchResultsTransform` class is responsible for fetching source tweets for a given set of search results. It collects the ids of source tweets, including extended reply and reply source tweets if needed, fetches those tweets from search, and populates them into the envelope. 

The class takes in several dependencies, including a `SearchClient`, a `FailOpenHandler`, a `DependencyProvider` for hydrating reply root tweets, a `DependencyProvider` for per-request source search client ID, and a `StatsReceiver`. 

The `apply` method is the main entry point for this class. It takes in a `CandidateEnvelope` and returns a `Future` of `CandidateEnvelope`. The method first extracts the `followedUserIds` from the `envelope`. It then computes the `searchResultsTweetIds` from the `envelope`'s `searchResults`. It uses the `SourceTweetsUtil` to get the `sourceTweetIds` for the given `searchResults`. If there are no `sourceTweetIds`, it returns an empty `Future` of `Seq[ThriftSearchResult]`. Otherwise, it calls the `getTweetsScoredForRecap` method on the `searchClient` to get the `sourceSearchResults` for the given `sourceTweetIds`. 

The `FailOpenHandler` is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the `apply` method. If an exception occurs, it returns an empty `Future` of `Seq[ThriftSearchResult]`. Finally, the `sourceSearchResults` are added to the `envelope` and the updated `envelope` is returned. 

This class is used in the larger project to fetch source tweets for a given set of search results. It is used in conjunction with other classes to rank and summarize tweets for a given user. 

Example usage:
```
val searchClient = new SearchClient(...)
val failOpenHandler = new FailOpenHandler(...)
val hydrateReplyRootTweetProvider = new DependencyProvider[Boolean](...)
val perRequestSourceSearchClientIdProvider = new DependencyProvider[Option[String]](...)
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver(...)

val sourceTweetsSearchResultsTransform = new SourceTweetsSearchResultsTransform(
  searchClient,
  failOpenHandler,
  hydrateReplyRootTweetProvider,
  perRequestSourceSearchClientIdProvider,
  statsReceiver
)

val envelope = new CandidateEnvelope(...)
sourceTweetsSearchResultsTransform(envelope).map { updatedEnvelope =>
  // Do something with the updated envelope
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code fetches source tweets for a given set of search results, collects ids of source tweets, including extended reply and reply source tweets if needed, fetches those tweets from search and populates them into the envelope.

2. What are the input parameters for the `SourceTweetsSearchResultsTransform` class?
- The input parameters for the `SourceTweetsSearchResultsTransform` class are `searchClient`, `failOpenHandler`, `hydrateReplyRootTweetProvider`, `perRequestSourceSearchClientIdProvider`, and `statsReceiver`.

3. What is the purpose of the `EmptySearchResults` and `EmptySearchResultsFuture` values?
- The `EmptySearchResults` value is an empty sequence of `ThriftSearchResult`. The `EmptySearchResultsFuture` value is a future that returns an empty sequence of `ThriftSearchResult`. These values are used when there are no source tweet ids to fetch.
