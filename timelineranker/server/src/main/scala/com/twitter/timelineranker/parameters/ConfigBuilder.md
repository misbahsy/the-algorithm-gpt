The `ConfigBuilder` class in the `com.twitter.timelineranker.parameters` package is responsible for building a global composite configuration that contains prioritized "layers" of parameter overrides based on whitelists, experiments, and deciders. This configuration can be used in tests with mocked decider and whitelist. 

The `ConfigBuilder` class has three properties: `prodConfig`, `whitelistConfig`, and `rootConfig`. 

The `prodConfig` property is a `Config` object that includes all configurations that contribute to production behavior. At a minimum, it should include all configurations containing decider-based parameter overrides. It is important that the production config includes all production parameter overrides as it is used to build holdback experiment configurations. If the production config doesn't include all parameter overrides supporting production behavior, then holdback experiment "production" buckets will not reflect production behavior. 

The `whitelistConfig` property is a `Config` object that contains no whitelists configured at present. 

The `rootConfig` property is a `Config` object that is a composite of the `whitelistConfig` and `prodConfig` properties. 

This class is used in the larger project to build a global composite configuration that can be used in tests with mocked decider and whitelist. 

Example usage:

```scala
val deciderGateBuilder: DeciderGateBuilder = ???
val statsReceiver: StatsReceiver = ???

val configBuilder = new ConfigBuilder(deciderGateBuilder, statsReceiver)
val rootConfig = configBuilder.rootConfig
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code builds a global composite config containing prioritized "layers" of parameter overrides based on whitelists, experiments, and deciders, which can be used in tests with mocked decider and whitelist.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of this code?
- The inputs of this code are various parameter override configs, decider gate builder, and stats receiver. The output of this code is a composite config that includes all the input configs.

3. What is the significance of the `prodConfig` and `rootConfig` variables?
- `prodConfig` is a production config that includes all configs containing decider-based param overrides, and it is used to build holdback experiment configs. `rootConfig` is a composite config that includes `whitelistConfig` and `prodConfig`, and it is the final output of this code.
