The `TrimToMatchHydratedTweetsTransform` object is a utility that trims a set of search results to match a set of hydrated tweets. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the search results returned by a search query match the set of hydrated tweets that were previously filtered. 

The `TrimToMatchHydratedTweetsTransform` object is defined as a `FutureArrow` that takes a `CandidateEnvelope` as input and returns a `Future` of a `CandidateEnvelope`. The `CandidateEnvelope` is a case class that contains two sequences of data: `searchResults` and `hydratedTweets`. The `searchResults` sequence contains the search results returned by a search query, while the `hydratedTweets` sequence contains the hydrated tweets that were previously filtered. 

The `apply` method of the `TrimToMatchHydratedTweetsTransform` object takes a `CandidateEnvelope` as input and returns a `Future` of a `CandidateEnvelope`. The method first calls the `trimSearchResults` method to filter the `searchResults` sequence to match the `hydratedTweets` sequence. It then calls the `trimSearchResults` method again to filter the `sourceSearchResults` sequence to match the `sourceHydratedTweets` sequence. Finally, it returns a new `CandidateEnvelope` with the filtered `searchResults` and `sourceSearchResults` sequences.

The `trimSearchResults` method takes two sequences as input: `searchResults` and `hydratedTweets`. It returns a new sequence of search results that match the tweet IDs in the `hydratedTweets` sequence. The method first creates a set of tweet IDs from the `hydratedTweets` sequence using the `map` and `toSet` methods. It then filters the `searchResults` sequence using the `filter` method and a predicate that checks if the tweet ID of each search result is in the set of tweet IDs from the `hydratedTweets` sequence.

Overall, the `TrimToMatchHydratedTweetsTransform` object is a useful utility for ensuring that search results match a set of hydrated tweets. It can be used in the larger project to improve the accuracy of search results and provide more relevant content to users. An example usage of this code might look like:

```
val envelope = CandidateEnvelope(searchResults, hydratedTweets, sourceSearchResults, sourceHydratedTweets)
val trimmedEnvelope = TrimToMatchHydratedTweetsTransform(envelope)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a Scala object that defines a function to trim search results to match with hydrated tweets.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `trimSearchResults` function?
    
    The `trimSearchResults` function takes in two arguments: a sequence of `ThriftSearchResult` objects and a sequence of `HydratedTweet` objects. It returns a sequence of `ThriftSearchResult` objects.

3. What is the purpose of the `FutureArrow` trait and how is it used in this code?
    
    The `FutureArrow` trait is used to define a function that takes a `Future` as input and returns a `Future` as output. In this code, the `TrimToMatchHydratedTweetsTransform` object extends the `FutureArrow` trait and overrides its `apply` method to take a `CandidateEnvelope` object as input and return a `Future` of `CandidateEnvelope` as output.
