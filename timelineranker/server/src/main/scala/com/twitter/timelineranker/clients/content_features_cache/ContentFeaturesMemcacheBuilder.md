The `ContentFeaturesMemcacheBuilder` class is responsible for building a memcache store that will hold content features for tweets. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to store and retrieve content features for tweets in a distributed cache, which can be accessed by other parts of the larger project.

The class takes in a `StorehausMemcacheConfig` object, which contains configuration information for the memcache store, a `Duration` object representing the time-to-live (TTL) for the cache, and a `StatsReceiver` object for collecting statistics on cache usage.

The class uses the `Injection` class from the `com.twitter.bijection` package to convert between `ContentFeatures` objects and their Thrift representations, which are used to store the data in the memcache store. The `scalaToThriftInjection` object is used to convert `ContentFeatures` objects to Thrift objects, while the `thriftToBytesInjection` object is used to convert Thrift objects to byte arrays, which can be stored in the memcache store.

The `underlyingBuilder` object is an instance of the `MemcacheStoreBuilder` class, which is responsible for building the actual memcache store. It takes in the configuration information, scope name, stats receiver, and TTL, and returns a `Store` object that can be used to store and retrieve content features for tweets.

The `build()` method simply calls the `build()` method on the `underlyingBuilder` object and returns the resulting `Store` object.

Overall, this class provides a way to store and retrieve content features for tweets in a distributed cache, which can be accessed by other parts of the larger project. Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```
val config = new StorehausMemcacheConfig(...)
val ttl = Duration.fromSeconds(60)
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver(...)
val builder = new ContentFeaturesMemcacheBuilder(config, ttl, statsReceiver)
val store = builder.build()

// Store content features for a tweet
val tweetId = TweetId(...)
val contentFeatures = ContentFeatures(...)
store.put(tweetId, contentFeatures)

// Retrieve content features for a tweet
val retrievedFeatures = store.get(tweetId)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `ContentFeaturesMemcacheBuilder` that builds a store for content features of tweets using Memcache.

2. What other dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several dependencies from other packages, including `com.twitter.bijection`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, `com.twitter.storehaus`, and `com.twitter.timelines`.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `build()` method?
- The `build()` method returns a store for content features of tweets using Memcache, with a specified time-to-live (TTL) and stats receiver.
