[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/timelineranker/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/timelineranker/util/RecommendedRepliesFilter.scala)

The code defines an object called RecommendedRepliesFilter that contains two private methods: isRecommendedReply and isRecommendedReplyToNotFollowedUser. These methods take in a HydratedTweet object, which represents a tweet with additional metadata, as well as other parameters such as a sequence of followed user IDs and a set of muted user IDs.

The purpose of these methods is to filter out recommended replies to tweets based on certain criteria. The isRecommendedReply method checks if a tweet has a reply and is not from a followed user, while the isRecommendedReplyToNotFollowedUser method checks if a tweet is a recommended reply to a tweet from a followed user but is not from a muted user and is not a retweet.

These methods may be used in the larger project to help rank and display tweets in a user's timeline. By filtering out recommended replies that do not meet certain criteria, the timeline can be optimized to show more relevant and interesting content to the user.

Here is an example of how these methods may be used:

```
import com.twitter.timelineranker.util.RecommendedRepliesFilter
import com.twitter.timelines.model.{UserId, HydratedTweet}

val followedUserIds: Seq[UserId] = Seq(123, 456, 789)
val mutedUserIds: Set[UserId] = Set(987, 654, 321)
val tweet: HydratedTweet = // get a tweet object

if (RecommendedRepliesFilter.isRecommendedReplyToNotFollowedUser(tweet, viewingUserId, followedUserIds, mutedUserIds)) {
  // do something with the tweet
}
```

In this example, the isRecommendedReplyToNotFollowedUser method is used to check if a tweet is a recommended reply that should be displayed to the user. If it meets the criteria, then some action can be taken with the tweet object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines an object called `RecommendedRepliesFilter` with two private methods that take in tweet and user data to determine if a tweet is a recommended reply. A smart developer might want to know how this object is used in the larger project and what other components it interacts with.

2. What is the difference between the `isRecommendedReply` and `isRecommendedReplyToNotFollowedUser` methods?
- The `isRecommendedReply` method checks if a tweet is a recommended reply based on whether it has a reply and is not from a followed user. The `isRecommendedReplyToNotFollowedUser` method builds on this by also checking if the tweet is not a retweet, is in reply to a followed user, and is not from a muted user. A smart developer might want to know why these additional checks are necessary and how they affect the overall filtering process.

3. What is the significance of the access modifier `private[util]` before the method definitions?
- The `private[util]` access modifier limits the visibility of the methods to the `util` package, meaning they can only be accessed by other classes or objects within that package. A smart developer might want to know why this restriction is in place and what other parts of the project are in the `util` package.
