The `CandidateEnvelope` object is a data structure used in the TimeLineRanker core of the Twitter algorithm. It contains information about a candidate tweet that is being considered for inclusion in a user's timeline. 

The object has several fields, including `query`, which is a `RecapQuery` object representing the query used to retrieve the candidate tweet. The `searchResults` field is a sequence of `ThriftSearchResult` objects representing the search results that led to the candidate tweet. The `utegResults` field is a map of `TweetId` objects to `TweetRecommendation` objects, representing recommendations for related tweets based on the user-tweet-entity graph. The `hydratedTweets` field is a `HydratedTweets` object representing the hydrated version of the candidate tweet. The `followGraphData` field is a `FollowGraphDataFuture` object representing the follow graph data for the user who posted the candidate tweet. Finally, the `sourceSearchResults` and `sourceHydratedTweets` fields represent the search results and hydrated tweets for the source tweet (i.e. the tweet that was retweeted or replied to).

This object is used to store all the relevant information about a candidate tweet in one place, making it easier to process and rank the tweets for inclusion in a user's timeline. For example, the `searchResults` and `utegResults` fields can be used to determine the relevance of the candidate tweet to the user's interests, while the `hydratedTweets` field can be used to extract additional information about the tweet (e.g. the sentiment or topic). The `followGraphData` field can be used to determine the user's relationship to the tweet author, which may affect the ranking of the tweet.

Here is an example of how the `CandidateEnvelope` object might be used in the larger TimeLineRanker project:

```scala
val query = RecapQuery("cats")
val searchResults = Seq(ThriftSearchResult("cat video", 0.8), ThriftSearchResult("funny cat meme", 0.6))
val utegResults = Map(TweetId(1234) -> TweetRecommendation("cute cat photo", 0.9))
val hydratedTweets = HydratedTweets(Seq("cat", "video"), Seq("cute", "funny"))
val followGraphData = FollowGraphDataFuture(userFollowers = Seq("alice", "bob"), tweetAuthorFollowers = Seq("bob", "charlie"))
val sourceSearchResults = Seq(ThriftSearchResult("original tweet", 0.7))
val sourceHydratedTweets = HydratedTweets(Seq("cat"), Seq("cute"))

val candidate = CandidateEnvelope(query, searchResults, utegResults, hydratedTweets, followGraphData, sourceSearchResults, sourceHydratedTweets)
```

In this example, we create a `CandidateEnvelope` object for a candidate tweet about cats. We provide search results, UTEG results, and hydrated tweet information to help rank the tweet for inclusion in a user's timeline. We also provide follow graph data to help determine the user's relationship to the tweet author. Finally, we provide information about the source tweet (i.e. the tweet that was retweeted or replied to) to help with ranking.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CandidateEnvelope` class and its properties?
- The `CandidateEnvelope` class is used to store data related to a query, including search results, tweet recommendations, and hydrated tweets. Its properties include default values for these data types.
2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including `com.twitter.recos.user_tweet_entity_graph.thriftscala.TweetRecommendation`, `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thriftscala.ThriftSearchResult`, `com.twitter.timelineranker.model.RecapQuery`, and `com.twitter.timelines.model.TweetId`.
3. What is the purpose of the `EmptySearchResults` and `EmptyHydratedTweets` properties?
- These properties provide default empty values for the `searchResults` and `hydratedTweets` properties of the `CandidateEnvelope` class, respectively.
