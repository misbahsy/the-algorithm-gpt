The DebugObserverBuilder class is responsible for building a DebugObserver that is attached to thrift requests. The purpose of this class is to centralize the gates that determine whether or not to enable debug transcripts for a particular request. 

The DebugObserver is a class that observes the execution of a request and logs debug information. It is useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues in the application. 

The DebugObserverBuilder takes a UserList as a parameter, which is a list of users that are allowed to enable debug transcripts. The queryGate method in DebugObserverBuilder returns a Gate object that determines whether or not to enable debug transcripts for a particular request. 

The Gate object takes an Any object as a parameter and returns a Boolean value. It checks the type of the object and determines whether or not to enable debug transcripts based on the user ID in the request and the whitelist of users allowed to enable debug transcripts. 

The DebugObserverBuilder is used in the larger project to enable debug transcripts for specific requests. For example, if a user is experiencing an issue with their timeline, the DebugObserver can be enabled for their request to log additional information that can be used to troubleshoot the issue. 

Example usage:

```
val userList = new UserList(Seq("user1", "user2"))
val debugObserverBuilder = new DebugObserverBuilder(userList)
val debugObserver = debugObserverBuilder.observer

// Attach the debug observer to a thrift request
thriftRequest.attachObserver(debugObserver)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the DebugObserver class and how is it used in this code?
   - The DebugObserver class is used to enable debug transcripts for a particular request. It is attached to thrift requests through the observer property of the DebugObserverBuilder class.
   
2. What is the significance of the whitelist parameter in the DebugObserverBuilder constructor?
   - The whitelist parameter is a UserList object that is used to determine whether or not to enable debug transcripts for a particular user. It is used to create a queryGate that checks if the user is allowed to have debug transcripts enabled.

3. What types of queries are checked in the queryGate method and how are they evaluated for debug transcript enablement?
   - The queryGate method checks for several types of queries including EngagedTweetsQuery, RecapHydrationQuery, RecapQuery, and TimelineQuery. It evaluates each query by checking if the user associated with the query is allowed to have debug transcripts enabled based on the whitelist parameter.
