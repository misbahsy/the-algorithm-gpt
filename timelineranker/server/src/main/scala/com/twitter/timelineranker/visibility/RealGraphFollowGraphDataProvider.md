The `RealGraphFollowGraphDataProvider` class is a wrapper around an underlying `FollowGraphDataProvider` that supplements the list of followings provided by the underlying provider with additional followings fetched from RealGraph if it looks like the underlying provider did not get the full list of the user's followings. 

The class is mainly intended for use in the home timeline materialization path, with the goal of preventing a case where users who follow a very large number of accounts may not see Tweets from their earlier follows if we used SGS-based follow fetching alone.

The class has several methods that override the methods of the `FollowGraphDataProvider` trait. The `getAsync` method takes a user ID and a maximum number of followings to return, and returns a `FollowGraphDataFuture` object. The `getFollowing` method takes a user ID and a maximum number of followings to return, and returns a `Future` of a sequence of user IDs. The `getMutuallyFollowingUserIds` method takes a user ID and a sequence of user IDs, and returns a `Future` of a set of user IDs.

The `supplementFollowsWithRealGraph` method is a private method that takes a user ID, a maximum number of followings to return, a sequence of user IDs, and a start time. It returns a `Future` of a sequence of user IDs. This method first checks whether the size of the underlying following list is >= the max requested following count, which implies that there were additional followings beyond the max requested count. If so, it fetches the full set of followings from RealGraph, which will be at most 2000. 

Because the RealGraph dataset is not realtime and thus can potentially include stale followings, the provider confirms that the followings fetched from RealGraph are valid using SGS's `getFollowOverlap` method, and then merges the valid RealGraph followings with the underlying followings. 

The class has several instance variables that are used to keep track of statistics related to the class's performance. These include counters for the number of requests, the number of times the underlying provider returned the maximum number of followings, and the number of times the RealGraph response was empty. There are also stats for the total latency when supplementing, the latency of supplementing follows, the size of the RealGraph follows, and the size of the non-overlapping follows. 

Overall, this class is an important part of the larger project as it ensures that users who follow a very large number of accounts can see Tweets from their earlier follows.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a Scala implementation of a FollowGraphDataProvider that supplements the list of followings provided by the underlying provider with additional followings fetched from RealGraph if it looks like the underlying provider did not get the full list of the user's followings. It is intended for use in the home timeline materialization path to prevent a case where users who follow a very large number of accounts may not see Tweets from their earlier follows if we used SGS-based follow fetching alone.

2. What external dependencies does this code have and how are they used? 
- This code has several external dependencies including com.twitter.finagle.stats.Stat, com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.servo.repository.KeyValueRepository, com.twitter.servo.util.Gate, com.twitter.timelineranker.core.FollowGraphData, com.twitter.timelineranker.core.FollowGraphDataFuture, com.twitter.timelines.clients.socialgraph.SocialGraphClient, com.twitter.timelines.model.UserId, com.twitter.timelines.util.FailOpenHandler, com.twitter.util.Future, com.twitter.util.Stopwatch, and com.twitter.wtf.candidate.thriftscala.CandidateSeq. These dependencies are used for various purposes such as tracking statistics, handling failures, and making asynchronous requests.

3. What is the algorithm used to supplement the list of followings and what are the potential drawbacks of this approach? 
- The algorithm first checks whether the size of the underlying following list is >= the max requested following count, which implies that there were additional followings beyond the max requested count. If so, it fetches the full set of followings from RealGraph (go/realgraph), which will be at most 2000. Because the RealGraph dataset is not realtime and thus can potentially include stale followings, the provider confirms that the followings fetched from RealGraph are valid using SGS's getFollowOverlap method, and then merges the valid RealGraph followings with the underlying followings. The potential drawbacks of this approach include the fact that it is expected to be very rare as most users do not have more than the max followings we fetch from SGS, and that the RealGraph dataset is not realtime and thus can potentially include stale followings.
