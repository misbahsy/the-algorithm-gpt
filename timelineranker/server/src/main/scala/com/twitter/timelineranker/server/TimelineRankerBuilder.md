The `TimelineRankerBuilder` class is responsible for building and configuring the `TimelineRanker` service, which is a Finagle service that provides a ranking of tweets for a given user's timeline. The `TimelineRanker` service is used in the larger project to provide personalized timelines to Twitter users.

The `TimelineRankerBuilder` class takes a `RuntimeConfiguration` object as input, which contains various configuration parameters for the `TimelineRanker` service. The class then uses these configuration parameters to build and configure the various components of the `TimelineRanker` service.

The `TimelineRanker` service is composed of several repositories that are responsible for retrieving and ranking tweets. These repositories include the `RoutingTimelineRepository`, `InNetworkTweetRepository`, `RecapHydrationRepository`, `RecapAuthorRepository`, `EntityTweetsRepository`, and `UtegLikedByTweetsRepository`. Each of these repositories is built using a corresponding builder class, such as `RoutingTimelineRepositoryBuilder` and `InNetworkTweetRepositoryBuilder`.

The `TimelineRankerBuilder` class also configures various filters that are used to limit the number of concurrent requests handled by the `TimelineRanker` service, forward traffic to the `TimelineRanker` proxy, and warm up the forwarding client. These filters include the `ClientIdRequiredFilter`, `DeciderableRequestSemaphoreFilter`, `DarkTrafficFilter`, and `ThriftForwardingWarmUpFilter`.

Finally, the `TimelineRankerBuilder` class creates two `ServiceFactory` objects that are used to create instances of the `TimelineRanker` service. One `ServiceFactory` uses the `TBinaryProtocol` protocol factory, while the other uses the `TCompactProtocol` protocol factory.

Example usage:

```scala
val config = new RuntimeConfiguration(...)
val builder = new TimelineRankerBuilder(config)
val serviceFactory = builder.serviceFactory
val compactProtocolServiceFactory = builder.compactProtocolServiceFactory
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a builder for a timeline ranker service for Twitter. It creates various repositories and filters to handle incoming requests and limit concurrency, and ultimately creates a service factory for the timeline ranker.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries, including Finagle, Thrift, and Apache Thrift Protocol.

3. What is the role of the `DeciderKey` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `DeciderKey` class is used to enable or disable certain features or filters based on runtime configuration. It is used to create a linear gate for limiting concurrency, and to enable routing to a ranker dev proxy for dark traffic.
