The `RecapParams` object contains a set of parameters used in the Recap feature of the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. These parameters control various aspects of the Recap feature, such as the limit on the number of followed users fetched from SGS, the maximum number of hits for Earlybird, and the probability of including a random tweet in the response. 

The object contains several sub-objects, each of which represents a specific parameter. For example, the `MaxFollowedUsersParam` object controls the limit on the number of followed users fetched from SGS. It is an instance of the `FSBoundedParam` class, which is a bounded parameter that can be controlled by the FS (feature store). It has a default value of 1000 and a minimum and maximum value of 1 and 3000, respectively. 

Other notable sub-objects include `EnableRealGraphUsersParam`, which enables fetching author seedset from real graph users, and `MaxCountMultiplierParam`, which multiplies the `maxCount` parameter supplied by the caller by a multiplier to fetch more candidates from search. 

Overall, the `RecapParams` object provides a centralized location for managing the parameters used in the Recap feature. By adjusting these parameters, developers can fine-tune the behavior of the Recap feature to better suit their needs. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.timelineranker.parameters.recap.RecapParams

// Get the maximum number of followed users
val maxFollowedUsers = RecapParams.MaxFollowedUsers.default

// Enable fetching author seedset from real graph users
RecapParams.EnableRealGraphUsersParam.set(true)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines various parameters for the Recap feature in Twitter's Timelines service, such as limits on the number of followed users fetched and the probability of including a random tweet in the response.
2. What is the significance of the `BoundsWithDefault` and `FSBoundedParam` classes?
- The `BoundsWithDefault` class defines a range of values with a default value, while the `FSBoundedParam` class is a parameter with a name, default value, and minimum/maximum bounds that can be controlled by a feature flag.
3. What is the purpose of the `ImputeRealGraphAuthorWeightsParam` and `EnableRealGraphUsersParam` parameters?
- The `ImputeRealGraphAuthorWeightsParam` parameter is an experimental feature that attempts to impute missing relevance scores for follow-graph store data by using aggregated statistics from real-graph scores. The `EnableRealGraphUsersParam` parameter enables fetching author seedset from real graph users if the user follows at least 1000 users.
