The code defines two classes, `MemcacheFactory` and `ScopedMemcacheFactory`, that are used to create a Memcache-backed cache object. The purpose of this code is to provide a way for clients to store and retrieve data from a Memcache server using a cache object. 

The `MemcacheFactory` class takes in a `FinagleMemcacheClient` object and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. It provides a method `apply` that takes in a key serializer, a value serializer, and a time-to-live (TTL) duration. The `apply` method returns a `MemcacheCache` object that is backed by a Memcache server. The `MemcacheCache` object is created using an `ObservableMemcache` object, which is a wrapper around the `FinagleMemcacheClient` object that provides additional functionality such as cache observation. The `ttl` parameter specifies the amount of time that the cache should keep the data before it expires. The `serializer` parameter specifies the serializer to use for the cache values. The `transformKey` parameter specifies the serializer to use for the cache keys.

The `ScopedMemcacheFactory` class extends the `ScopedFactory` class and provides a way to create a `MemcacheFactory` object that is scoped to a particular request. The `scope` method takes in a `RequestScope` object and returns a new `MemcacheFactory` object that is scoped to the specified request. The `statsReceiver` object is scoped to the "memcache" namespace with the specified request scope.

Overall, this code provides a way for clients to create a Memcache-backed cache object that can be used to store and retrieve data. The `MemcacheFactory` class provides the main functionality for creating the cache object, while the `ScopedMemcacheFactory` class provides a way to create a scoped `MemcacheFactory` object. This code can be used in a larger project that requires caching of data to improve performance. For example, a web application that needs to retrieve data from a database can use this code to cache the data in a Memcache server to reduce the number of database queries. 

Example usage:
```
val memcacheClient = FinagleMemcache.newClient("localhost:11211")
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()
val memcacheFactory = new MemcacheFactory(memcacheClient, statsReceiver)

// Define key and value serializers
val keySerializer = (key: String) => key
val valueSerializer = new MyValueSerializer()

// Create a cache object with a TTL of 1 hour
val cache = memcacheFactory(keySerializer, valueSerializer, Duration.fromHours(1))

// Store a value in the cache
cache.put("myKey", myValue)

// Retrieve a value from the cache
val cachedValue = cache.get("myKey")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a factory for creating a Memcache-backed cache object that requires a serializer/deserializer for keys and values. It solves the problem of caching data in a distributed system using Memcache.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several libraries from the Finagle and Servo frameworks, including FinagleMemcache, StatsReceiver, Logger, MemcacheCache, ObservableMemcache, Serializer, StatsReceiverCacheObserver, RequestScope, and ScopedFactory.

3. How is the MemcacheCache object created and configured?
- The MemcacheCache object is created by instantiating a new ObservableMemcache object with a FinagleMemcacheClient and a StatsReceiverCacheObserver, and passing it along with a TTL, serializer, and key serializer to the MemcacheCache constructor. The TTL determines how long the cache entries will be stored, the serializer is used to serialize/deserialize the cache values, and the key serializer is used to transform the cache keys.
