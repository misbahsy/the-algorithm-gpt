The `FollowGraphDataFuture` class is a case class that is similar to the `FollowGraphData` class, but it makes its fields available as separate futures. This class takes in a `userId` of type `UserId` and four futures of type `Future[Seq[UserId]]`, `Future[Set[UserId]]`, `Future[Set[UserId]]`, and `Future[Set[UserId]]` respectively. These futures represent the `followedUserIds`, `mutuallyFollowingUserIds`, `mutedUserIds`, and `retweetsMutedUserIds` fields of the `FollowGraphData` class.

The `inNetworkUserIdsFuture` method returns a future of type `Future[Seq[UserId]]` that concatenates the `followedUserIds` sequence with the `userId` to get the `inNetworkUserIds`.

The `get` method returns a future of type `Future[FollowGraphData]` that joins the four futures using the `Future.join` method and maps the result to a `FollowGraphData` object. The `FollowGraphData` object is constructed using the `userId` and the four fields obtained from the futures.

The `FollowGraphDataFuture` object contains a method `mkEmptyFuture` that takes in a `field` of type `String` and returns a future of type `Future[Nothing]` that throws an exception with a message indicating that the field was accessed without being set. The `EmptyFollowGraphDataFuture` is a `FollowGraphDataFuture` object with all its fields set to the result of calling `mkEmptyFuture` on each field. This object can be used as a default value when a `FollowGraphDataFuture` object is required but none is available.

This code is used in the larger project to represent the follow graph data of a user on Twitter. The `FollowGraphDataFuture` class is used to obtain the follow graph data of a user as separate futures, which can be useful in cases where only some of the fields are required. The `FollowGraphData` class is used to obtain the follow graph data of a user as a single object, which can be useful in cases where all the fields are required. The `EmptyFollowGraphDataFuture` object is used as a default value when a `FollowGraphDataFuture` object is required but none is available.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code defines a case class called FollowGraphDataFuture that represents data about a user's Twitter network. It also includes a method to retrieve the data as a FollowGraphData object. A smart developer might want to know how this class is used in the project and what other components it interacts with.

2. What are the expected inputs and outputs of the FollowGraphDataFuture class?
- The FollowGraphDataFuture class takes in a UserId and four Future objects representing different sets of user IDs. It outputs a FollowGraphData object when the get() method is called. A smart developer might want to know what types of data are expected to be passed into this class and what the FollowGraphData object contains.

3. What is the purpose of the mkEmptyFuture method in the FollowGraphDataFuture object?
- The mkEmptyFuture method is used to create a Future object that throws an exception when accessed. It is used to initialize the EmptyFollowGraphDataFuture object, which represents an empty instance of the FollowGraphDataFuture class. A smart developer might want to know why this object is needed and how it is used in the project.
