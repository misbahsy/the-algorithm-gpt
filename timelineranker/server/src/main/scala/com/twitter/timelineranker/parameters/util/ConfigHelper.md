The `ConfigHelper` class in the `com.twitter.timelineranker.parameters.util` package provides methods to create decider-based overrides for configuration parameters. The purpose of this code is to allow for dynamic configuration of the `timelineranker` module in the larger Twitter project. 

The `createDeciderBasedBooleanOverrides` method takes a sequence of boolean parameters and returns a sequence of `OptionalOverride[Boolean]` objects. Each `OptionalOverride` object represents an override for a specific boolean parameter based on a decider gate. The decider gate is built using the `DeciderGateBuilder` passed to the `ConfigHelper` constructor and the `DeciderKeyName` associated with the parameter in the `deciderByParam` map. The `RecipientBuilder` is set to `User`, meaning the override applies to individual users rather than groups. If the decider gate is enabled for the user, the parameter is overridden with the `enabledValue` (true), otherwise it is overridden with the `disabledValueOption` (Some(false)). 

The `createDeciderBasedOverrides` method is similar to `createDeciderBasedBooleanOverrides`, but takes a sequence of parameters of any type that extends `DeciderValueConverter`. It returns a sequence of `OptionalOverride[T]` objects, where `T` is the type of the parameter. The `DeciderIntSpaceOverrideValue` is used to create the override, with the same decider gate and feature as in the boolean method, but with a conversion function provided by the parameter's `convert` method. 

These methods are likely used in the larger project to allow for dynamic configuration of the `timelineranker` module based on decider gates. For example, if a certain user group is experiencing performance issues, a decider gate could be created to disable certain features for that group, and the `ConfigHelper` methods could be used to create overrides for the affected parameters. 

Example usage:
```
val deciderByParam: Map[Param[_], DeciderKeyName] = Map(
  booleanParam -> DeciderKeyName("myBooleanFeature"),
  intParam -> DeciderKeyName("myIntFeature")
)
val deciderGateBuilder: DeciderGateBuilder = ...
val configHelper = new ConfigHelper(deciderByParam, deciderGateBuilder)

val booleanOverrides = configHelper.createDeciderBasedBooleanOverrides(Seq(booleanParam))
val intOverrides = configHelper.createDeciderBasedOverrides(Seq(intParam))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code provides helper methods for creating decider-based overrides for configuration parameters in the Twitter Timeline Ranker project. It allows developers to easily create boolean and integer overrides based on decider keys.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several classes from the `com.twitter.servo.decider` and `com.twitter.timelines.configapi` packages, which are likely part of the Twitter Timeline Ranker project.
3. How are the decider keys mapped to features and recipients in this code?
   - The `createDeciderBasedBooleanOverrides` method maps the decider key for a given boolean parameter to a feature and recipient, and sets the enabled and disabled values. The `createDeciderBasedOverrides` method does the same for integer parameters, but uses a conversion function to map the parameter value to an integer space.
