The code defines a `RequestContextBuilder` interface and its implementation `RequestContextBuilderImpl` that builds a `CommonRequestContext` object. The `CommonRequestContext` trait extends several other traits that define the context of a request, such as the user ID, experiment context, and feature context. 

The `RequestContextBuilder` interface has a single method that takes two optional parameters: `recipientUserId` and `deviceContext`. The `recipientUserId` parameter is an optional user ID that represents the recipient of the request, and the `deviceContext` parameter is an optional device context that provides information about the device making the request. The method returns a `Future` that resolves to a `CommonRequestContext` object.

The `RequestContextBuilderImpl` implementation takes a `RequestContextFactory` object as a constructor parameter. The `apply` method of this implementation creates a `Future` that resolves to a `CommonRequestContext` object. It does this by calling the `requestContextFactory` method with several parameters, including the `recipientUserId` and `deviceContextOpt` parameters passed to the `apply` method. The `requestContextFactory` method returns a `Future` that resolves to a `BaseRequestContext` object.

The `map` method is then called on the `requestContextFut` `Future` to transform the `BaseRequestContext` object into a `CommonRequestContext` object. The `CommonRequestContext` object is created by extending the `BaseRequestContext` object and overriding some of its properties with the values from the `requestContext` object. The `userId`, `experimentContext`, and `featureContext` properties are overridden with the `recipientUserId` and the corresponding properties of the `requestContext` object.

This code is likely used in the larger project to create a `CommonRequestContext` object that represents the context of a request. This context can then be used by other parts of the project to determine how to handle the request, such as which experiments or features to enable or disable. An example usage of this code might look like:

```
val builder = new RequestContextBuilderImpl(requestContextFactory)
val recipientUserId = Some(UserId("12345"))
val deviceContext = Some(DeviceContext("iPhone", "iOS", "14.5"))
val requestContextFut = builder(recipientUserId, deviceContext)
requestContextFut.map { requestContext =>
  // Use the requestContext object to handle the request
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a trait and a class for building a common request context for a Twitter timeline service.

2. What other dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several classes from other packages, including `com.twitter.servo.util.Gate` and `com.twitter.timelineservice.DeviceContext`.

3. What is the expected output of the `apply` method in `RequestContextBuilder`?
- The `apply` method takes in an optional recipient user ID and device context, and returns a future that resolves to a `CommonRequestContext` object. The `CommonRequestContext` object includes the recipient user ID and experiment/feature contexts from the request context.
