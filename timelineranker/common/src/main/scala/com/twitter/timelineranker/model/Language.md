The code defines a Language class and an object that provides a method to convert a thrift Language object to a Language instance. The Language class represents a language and its scope, and has a method to convert it to a thrift Language object. It also has a method to check if the language is valid, using the LocaleUtil class to get the locale of the language and checking if it is not unknown.

This code is likely part of a larger project that involves analyzing and ranking Twitter timelines based on various factors, including language. The Language class is used to represent the language of a tweet or user profile, and the fromThrift method in the Language object is likely used to convert thrift Language objects received from the Twitter API to Language instances that can be used in the project. The toThrift method in the Language class is likely used to convert Language instances back to thrift Language objects when sending data to the Twitter API.

Here is an example of how the Language class might be used in the larger project:

```
import com.twitter.timelineranker.model.Language

// create a Language instance representing English tweets
val english = Language("en", LanguageScope.TWEET)

// check if the language is valid
english.throwIfInvalid()

// convert the Language instance to a thrift Language object
val thriftLanguage = english.toThrift()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a Language class and a Language object with methods to convert to and from a Thrift representation of a language and to check if a language is supported.

2. What is the significance of the LanguageScope enum?
    
    The LanguageScope enum is used to specify the scope of a language, which could be either a tweet or a user profile.

3. What is the purpose of the throwIfInvalid method?
    
    The throwIfInvalid method checks if a language is supported by checking if its locale can be determined. If the language is unsupported, it throws an exception.
