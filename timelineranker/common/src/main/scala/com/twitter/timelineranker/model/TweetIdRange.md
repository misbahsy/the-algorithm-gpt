The `TweetIdRange` object and `TweetIdRange` case class are part of the `com.twitter.timelineranker.model` package and are used to represent a range of Tweet IDs with exclusive bounds. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to create and manipulate Tweet ID ranges, which can be used in the larger project to filter and rank timelines based on specific criteria.

The `TweetIdRange` case class takes two optional parameters, `fromId` and `toId`, which represent the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively. The `fromId` and `toId` parameters are of type `Option[TweetId]`, where `TweetId` is a type alias for `Long`. This means that a `TweetIdRange` can have either one or both bounds specified, or neither if it is empty.

The `TweetIdRange` case class has several methods that can be used to convert it to and from other representations. The `toThrift` method returns a `thrift.TweetIdRange` object, which is a Thrift struct that represents a range of Tweet IDs. The `toTimelineRangeThrift` method returns a `thrift.TimelineRange` object, which is a Thrift union that can represent different types of timeline ranges, including `TweetIdRange`. These methods are useful for interoperating with other parts of the project that use Thrift.

The `TweetIdRange` object also has several methods that can be used to create `TweetIdRange` objects from other representations. The `fromThrift` method takes a `thrift.TweetIdRange` object and returns a `TweetIdRange` object. The `fromTimelineRange` method takes a `TimelineRange` object and returns a `TweetIdRange` object if the `TimelineRange` is a `TweetIdRange`, or throws an `IllegalArgumentException` otherwise. These methods are useful for converting between different representations of timeline ranges.

Overall, the `TweetIdRange` object and `TweetIdRange` case class provide a way to represent and manipulate ranges of Tweet IDs, which can be used in the larger project to filter and rank timelines based on specific criteria. For example, a `TweetIdRange` could be used to represent a range of Tweet IDs that correspond to a specific time period, and this range could be used to filter a timeline to only include Tweets from that time period.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a TweetIdRange class and its companion object that provides methods for creating instances of TweetIdRange from different sources.

2. What other classes or dependencies are required to use this code?
- This code requires the com.twitter.timeliner.thriftscala and com.twitter.timelines.model packages to be imported.

3. What is the expected behavior of the throwIfInvalid method?
- The throwIfInvalid method checks if the fromId and toId values of a TweetIdRange instance are valid, and throws an exception if they are not. Specifically, it requires that fromId is less than or equal to toId.
