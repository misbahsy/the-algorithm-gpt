The `RecapQuery` object is a model object that corresponds to the `RecapQuery` Thrift struct. It contains various methods that convert the Thrift struct to the `RecapQuery` object and vice versa. The `RecapQuery` object is used to query various types of tweets from Twitter's timelines. 

The `RecapQuery` object has various properties such as `userId`, `maxCount`, `range`, `options`, `searchOperator`, `earlybirdOptions`, `deviceContext`, `authorIds`, `tweetIds`, `semanticCoreIds`, `hashtags`, `languages`, `excludedTweetIds`, `utegLikedByTweetsOptions`, `searchClientSubId`, `params`, `candidateTweetSourceId`, `includeNullcastTweets`, `includeTweetsFromArchiveIndex`, and `hydratesContentFeatures`. 

The `fromThrift` methods convert the Thrift struct to the `RecapQuery` object. The `toThrift` methods convert the `RecapQuery` object to the Thrift struct. The `throwIfInvalid` method checks if the `RecapQuery` object is valid. 

The `RecapQuery` object is used in the larger project to query various types of tweets from Twitter's timelines. For example, the `fromThrift` method `fromThrift(query: thrift.EntityTweetsQuery)` is used to query tweets based on entities such as hashtags and languages. The `fromThrift` method `fromThrift(query: thrift.UtegLikedByTweetsQuery)` is used to query tweets that are liked by users in a given network. The `toThrift` methods are used to convert the `RecapQuery` object to the Thrift struct, which is then used to query tweets from Twitter's timelines. 

Example usage:

```scala
val query = RecapQuery(
  userId = 1234,
  maxCount = Some(100),
  range = Some(TimelineRange(Some(1234567890), Some(1234567899))),
  options = TweetKindOption.includeOriginalTweetsAndQuotes,
  searchOperator = SearchOperator.Exclude,
  earlybirdOptions = Some(EarlybirdOptions(Some(1234567890), Some(1234567899))),
  deviceContext = Some(DeviceContext(Some("iPhone"), Some("en"), Some("US"))),
  authorIds = Some(Seq(5678)),
  excludedTweetIds = Some(Seq(9876)),
  semanticCoreIds = Some(Set(SemanticCoreAnnotation("entity1", 0.5))),
  hashtags = Some(Set("hashtag1")),
  languages = Some(Set(Language("en"))),
  utegLikedByTweetsOptions = Some(UtegLikedByTweetsOptions(10, true, Map(5678 -> 0.5))),
  searchClientSubId = Some("searchClientSubId"),
  candidateTweetSourceId = Some(CandidateTweetSourceId.TwitterForAndroid),
  includeNullcastTweets = Some(true),
  includeTweetsFromArchiveIndex = Some(true),
  hydratesContentFeatures = Some(true)
)

val thriftQuery = query.toThriftEntityTweetsQuery
// use thriftQuery to query tweets from Twitter's timelines
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the RecapQuery object and what parameters does it take?
- The RecapQuery object is a model object corresponding to a Thrift struct used for querying tweets. It takes parameters such as userId, maxCount, range, options, searchOperator, earlybirdOptions, deviceContext, authorIds, tweetIds, semanticCoreIds, hashtags, languages, excludedTweetIds, utegLikedByTweetsOptions, searchClientSubId, candidateTweetSourceId, includeNullcastTweets, and hydratesContentFeatures.

2. What are the different fromThrift methods in the RecapQuery object used for?
- The different fromThrift methods in the RecapQuery object are used to convert Thrift structs to RecapQuery objects. There are different methods for different types of queries such as RecapQuery, RecapHydrationQuery, EngagedTweetsQuery, EntityTweetsQuery, and UtegLikedByTweetsQuery.

3. What is the purpose of the throwIfInvalid method in the RecapQuery object?
- The throwIfInvalid method in the RecapQuery object is used to check if the parameters of the RecapQuery object are valid. It checks if maxCount is a positive integer, if range is valid, if tweetIds is non-empty if present, if semanticCoreIds and languages are valid and unique if present, and throws an exception if any of these conditions are not met.
