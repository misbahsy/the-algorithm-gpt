The code above defines a case class called UtegLikedByTweetsOptions. This class is a part of the TimeLineRanker model in the Twitter project. The purpose of this class is to store options related to the ranking of tweets that are liked by a particular user.

The class has three properties: utegCount, isInNetwork, and weightedFollowings. The utegCount property is an integer that represents the number of tweets that should be ranked. The isInNetwork property is a boolean that indicates whether the tweets should be ranked based on the user's network or not. The weightedFollowings property is a map that contains UserId keys and Double values. This map represents the weighted followings of the user. The weights are used to rank the tweets based on the importance of the users who liked them.

This class can be used in the larger project to rank tweets that are liked by a particular user. For example, if a user wants to see the top 10 tweets that they liked, they can create an instance of this class with utegCount set to 10 and isInNetwork set to false. They can then pass this instance to a method that will use the weightedFollowings property to rank the tweets based on the importance of the users who liked them.

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
val options = UtegLikedByTweetsOptions(10, false, Map(userId1 -> 0.5, userId2 -> 0.3, userId3 -> 0.2))
val topLikedTweets = rankLikedTweets(user, options)
```

In this example, the options variable is an instance of the UtegLikedByTweetsOptions class with utegCount set to 10, isInNetwork set to false, and weightedFollowings set to a map that contains three UserId keys with corresponding Double values. The rankLikedTweets method will use these options to rank the tweets that the user liked and return the top 10 tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UtegLikedByTweetsOptions` case class?
   - The `UtegLikedByTweetsOptions` case class is used to store options for a function that ranks tweets based on how many users in a given network have liked them, with additional weighting based on the followings of those users.

2. What is the meaning of the `isInNetwork` boolean parameter?
   - The `isInNetwork` boolean parameter determines whether or not the ranking function should only consider likes from users within a given network. If `true`, only likes from users within the network will be counted, while if `false`, likes from all users will be counted.

3. What is the purpose of the `weightedFollowings` parameter?
   - The `weightedFollowings` parameter is a map that assigns a weight to each user in the network based on their number of followers. This weight is used to adjust the contribution of each user's likes to the overall ranking of a tweet.
