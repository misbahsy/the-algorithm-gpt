The `CandidateTweetsResult` object and `CandidateTweetsResult` case class are used to represent the result of a call to the `GetCandidateTweets` endpoint in the larger project. This endpoint returns a list of candidate tweets and a list of source tweets that are relevant to a given query. 

The `CandidateTweetsResult` object contains three static values: `Empty`, `EmptyFuture`, and `EmptyCandidateTweet`. `Empty` is an instance of `CandidateTweetsResult` with empty lists for both `candidates` and `sourceTweets`. `EmptyFuture` is a `Future` that resolves to `Empty`. `EmptyCandidateTweet` is an empty sequence of `CandidateTweet` objects. These values are used to represent empty or default values for `CandidateTweetsResult`.

The `fromThrift` method is used to convert a `thrift.GetCandidateTweetsResponse` object to a `CandidateTweetsResult` object. It extracts the `candidates` and `sourceTweets` lists from the `thrift.GetCandidateTweetsResponse` object and maps them to `CandidateTweet` objects using the `CandidateTweet.fromThrift` method. If either list is empty, it returns an `Empty` instance of `CandidateTweetsResult`. If `sourceTweets` is not empty, it checks that `candidates` is also not empty, throwing an exception if it is. It then returns a new instance of `CandidateTweetsResult` with the mapped `candidates` and `sourceTweets` lists.

The `CandidateTweetsResult` case class has two fields: `candidates` and `sourceTweets`, both of which are sequences of `CandidateTweet` objects. It also has a `toThrift` method that converts the `CandidateTweetsResult` object to a `thrift.GetCandidateTweetsResponse` object. It maps the `candidates` and `sourceTweets` lists to `thrift.CandidateTweet` objects using the `CandidateTweet.toThrift` method and returns a new `thrift.GetCandidateTweetsResponse` object with the mapped lists.

Overall, the `CandidateTweetsResult` object and `CandidateTweetsResult` case class provide a way to represent the result of a call to the `GetCandidateTweets` endpoint in the larger project. They allow for easy conversion between the `thrift` and Scala representations of the result and provide default values for empty or missing results. An example usage of these classes might be:

```
val response: thrift.GetCandidateTweetsResponse = // some response from the GetCandidateTweets endpoint
val result: CandidateTweetsResult = CandidateTweetsResult.fromThrift(response)
// do something with the result
val thriftResponse: thrift.GetCandidateTweetsResponse = result.toThrift
// send the thrift response back to the client
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CandidateTweetsResult` object and how is it used in the project?
   
   The `CandidateTweetsResult` object represents a result containing two sequences of `CandidateTweet` objects, `candidates` and `sourceTweets`. It is used to convert a Thrift response object to a Scala object and vice versa.

2. What is the significance of the `Empty` and `EmptyFuture` values in the `CandidateTweetsResult` object?
   
   The `Empty` value represents an empty `CandidateTweetsResult` object, while the `EmptyFuture` value represents a future that resolves to an empty `CandidateTweetsResult` object. These values are used as defaults and to simplify the code.

3. What is the purpose of the `require` statement in the `fromThrift` method of the `CandidateTweetsResult` object?
   
   The `require` statement checks that the `sourceTweets` sequence is not empty if the `candidates` sequence is not empty. This is to ensure that the data is consistent and valid.
