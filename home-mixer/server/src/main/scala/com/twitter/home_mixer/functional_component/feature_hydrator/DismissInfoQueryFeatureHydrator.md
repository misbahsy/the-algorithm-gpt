The `DismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator` is a Scala object that contains a case class `DismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator` and a companion object. The case class is a `QueryFeatureHydrator` that extends the `QueryFeatureHydrator` trait from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator` package. This trait is used to hydrate features for a given query. The `DismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator` hydrates the `DismissInfoFeature` for a given `PipelineQuery`. 

The `DismissInfoFeature` is a feature that contains a map of `DismissInfo` objects. The `hydrate` method of the `DismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator` uses an `InjectionHistoryClient` to read the `DismissInfo` entries for a given user ID and a sequence of `SuggestType`s. It then maps the response to a `DismissInfo` map and builds a `FeatureMap` using the `FeatureMapBuilder`. The `FeatureMap` contains the `DismissInfoFeature` and the `DismissInfo` map. 

The purpose of this code is to hydrate the `DismissInfoFeature` for a given `PipelineQuery`. The `DismissInfoFeature` is used in the larger project to provide information about dismissed suggestions to the timeline mixer. The `DismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator` is a part of the feature hydrator system that is used to hydrate features for a given query. 

Example usage:

```scala
val query = PipelineQuery(userId = 12345)
val dismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator = DismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator(dismissInfoClient)
val featureMap = dismissInfoQueryFeatureHydrator.hydrate(query).get()
val dismissInfoFeature = featureMap.get(DismissInfoFeature)
val dismissInfoMap = dismissInfoFeature.asInstanceOf[Map[String, DismissInfo]]
```
