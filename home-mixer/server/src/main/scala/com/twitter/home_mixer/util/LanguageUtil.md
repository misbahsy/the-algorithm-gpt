The `LanguageUtil` object in the `com.twitter.home_mixer.util` package provides methods for computing a list of languages based on user language information retrieved from Metastore. The purpose of this code is to help determine the languages that a user is most likely to understand and produce content in, based on their language preferences and usage.

The `computeLanguages` method takes in a `smg.UserLanguages` object, which contains information about the languages that the user has produced and consumed. It also takes in two optional parameters: `minProducedLanguageRatio` and `minConsumedLanguageConfidence`, which are used to filter out languages that do not meet certain criteria. The method returns a sequence of `scc.ThriftLanguage` objects, which represent the languages that the user is most likely to understand and produce content in. The list is sorted in descending order of confidence score associated with each language, with the language with the highest confidence value in index 0.

The `computeLanguageConfidenceMap` method is a helper method that computes a confidence map based on the user language information. The confidence map is a map where the key is a language code and the value is the level of confidence that the language is applicable to a user. This method takes in the same parameters as `computeLanguages` and returns a map of `scc.ThriftLanguage` objects and their corresponding confidence scores.

The `getLanguageMap` method is another helper method that takes in a sequence of `smg.ScoredString` objects and returns a map of `scc.ThriftLanguage` objects and their corresponding weights. This method is used to extract the language information from the `smg.UserLanguages` object.

The `getThriftLanguage` method is a final helper method that takes in a language name and returns a corresponding `scc.ThriftLanguage` object. This method is used to convert the language name to a `scc.ThriftLanguage` object, which is used throughout the code.

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project as it helps to determine the languages that a user is most likely to understand and produce content in. This information can be used to personalize the user's experience and provide them with content that is relevant to their language preferences. Here is an example of how this code can be used:

```
val userLanguages = smg.UserLanguages(Seq(smg.ScoredString("English", 0.9)), Seq(smg.ScoredString("Spanish", 0.8)))
val languages = LanguageUtil.computeLanguages(userLanguages)
println(languages) // prints Seq(ThriftLanguage(0), ThriftLanguage(1))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code computes a list of languages based on UserLanguages information retrieved from Metastore, sorted in descending order of confidence score associated with each language.

2. What are the input parameters for the `computeLanguages` function?
- The input parameters for the `computeLanguages` function are `userLanguages` of type `smg.UserLanguages`, `minProducedLanguageRatio` of type `Double` with a default value of `0.05`, and `minConsumedLanguageConfidence` of type `Double` with a default value of `0.8`.

3. What is the output of the `computeLanguageConfidenceMap` function?
- The output of the `computeLanguageConfidenceMap` function is a `Map` where the key is a `scc.ThriftLanguage` and the value is a `Double` representing the level of confidence that the language is applicable to a user.
