The `FocalTweetFeatureHydrator` class is a Scala implementation of a feature hydrator for the Twitter home timeline. The purpose of this class is to copy focal tweet data into the root tweet so that social context for conversation modules can be hydrated on the root tweet. This is necessary because the focal tweet contains information about the author that is needed to render the banner. 

The class extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class, which is a functional component that hydrates features for a batch of candidates. The `FocalTweetFeatureHydrator` class overrides the `identifier` and `features` properties of the parent class. The `identifier` property is a unique identifier for the feature hydrator, and the `features` property is a set of features that the hydrator will hydrate. 

The class also defines a `DefaultFeatureMap` property, which is a default feature map that is used when a candidate is not a root tweet or when its focal tweet's features are not available. 

The `apply` method is the main method of the class. It takes a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects as input and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]` object. The method first builds a map of all the focal tweets to their corresponding features. It then maps over the candidates and checks if the candidate is a root tweet and if its focal tweet's features are available. If so, it builds a new feature map with the focal tweet's features and returns it. Otherwise, it returns the default feature map. 

This class is used in the larger Twitter home timeline project to hydrate features for a batch of candidates. It is specifically used to hydrate focal tweet data into the root tweet so that social context for conversation modules can be hydrated on the root tweet. This is necessary for rendering the banner. 

Example usage:

```scala
val hydrator = new FocalTweetFeatureHydrator()
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(...)
val result = hydrator.apply(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a feature hydrator that copies focal tweet data into the root tweet to render the banner for social context for convo modules.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method? 
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` and outputs a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`.

3. What are the features that are being set in the `features` set? 
- The features being set in the `features` set are `FocalTweetAuthorIdFeature`, `FocalTweetInNetworkFeature`, `FocalTweetRealNamesFeature`, and `FocalTweetScreenNamesFeature`.
