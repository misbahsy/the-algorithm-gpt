The `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect` class is a pipeline side-effect that publishes candidate keys to a Kafka topic. This class extends the `KafkaPublishingSideEffect` class and implements the `PipelineResultSideEffect.Conditionally` trait. It takes a topic name and a set of candidate pipeline identifiers as input parameters. 

The purpose of this class is to publish candidate keys to a Kafka topic for further processing. The candidate keys are extracted from the pipeline query and are used to build a `ProducerRecord` object that is then published to the Kafka topic. The `buildRecords` method is responsible for building the `ProducerRecord` objects. This method takes the pipeline query, selected candidates, remaining candidates, dropped candidates, and response as input parameters. It extracts the candidate keys from the selected candidates using the `extractCandidates` method and builds a `ProducerRecord` object for each candidate key. The `key` of the `ProducerRecord` object is a `sc.CandidateFeatureKey` object, and the `value` is a `pldr.PolyDataRecord` object. 

The `onlyIf` method is used to determine whether the side-effect should be executed. It takes the pipeline query, selected candidates, remaining candidates, dropped candidates, and response as input parameters. It checks whether the `EnableServedCandidateKafkaPublishingParam` parameter is set to `true` in the pipeline query parameters. If it is set to `true`, the side-effect is executed; otherwise, it is skipped.

The `alerts` field is a sequence of `HomeMixerAlertConfig` objects that define the alerts to be triggered when the side-effect is executed. In this case, the default success rate alert is defined with a threshold of 98.5%.

Example usage:

```scala
val sideEffect = new ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect(
  topic = "candidate-keys-topic",
  sourceIdentifiers = Set(identifier.CandidatePipelineIdentifier("pipeline-1"))
)

val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val selectedCandidates = Seq(...)
val remainingCandidates = Seq(...)
val droppedCandidates = Seq(...)
val response = Timeline(...)

if (sideEffect.onlyIf(query, selectedCandidates, remainingCandidates, droppedCandidates, response)) {
  val records = sideEffect.buildRecords(query, selectedCandidates, remainingCandidates, droppedCandidates, response)
  records.foreach(record => kafkaProducer.send(record))
}
```
