The code defines a class called `NotRelevantChildFeedbackActionBuilder` that is used to build a child feedback action for a tweet candidate that is deemed not relevant. The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The class has one constructor that takes two parameters: a `StringCenter` instance and an instance of `HomeMixerExternalStrings`. The `StringCenter` is used to prepare strings for display, while `HomeMixerExternalStrings` contains externalized strings used in the feedback action.

The class has one method called `apply` that takes a `TweetCandidate` and a `FeatureMap` as input parameters and returns an `Option[ChildFeedbackAction]`. The `TweetCandidate` represents a tweet that is being evaluated for relevance, while the `FeatureMap` contains features associated with the tweet candidate. The method first prepares two strings using the `StringCenter` instance: `notRelevantString` and `notRelevantConfirmationString`. It then creates a `FeedbackMetadata` instance that contains information about the tweet being evaluated, such as its ID. It also creates a feedback URL using the `FeedbackInfo` object, which contains information about the feedback type, metadata, and injection type. Finally, it creates a `ChildFeedbackAction` object that contains information about the feedback action, such as the feedback type, prompt, confirmation, and feedback URL.

This class is likely used in a larger project that involves evaluating tweets for relevance and providing feedback to users. The `NotRelevantChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class is responsible for building a feedback action that allows users to indicate that a tweet is not relevant. This feedback can then be used to improve the relevance of future tweets shown to the user. The `FeatureMap` parameter allows for additional features to be associated with the tweet candidate, which can be used to further refine the relevance evaluation. Overall, this class is a small but important part of a larger system that aims to improve the relevance of tweets shown to users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a child feedback action builder for the Twitter home mixer product. It provides a way to generate feedback actions for tweets that are not relevant to the user.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including the Twitter string center client, the Twitter timelineservice model, and the Twitter product mixer component library model.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `TweetCandidate` object and a `FeatureMap` object, and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction` object. The purpose of this method is to generate a feedback action for the given tweet candidate based on its features and metadata.
