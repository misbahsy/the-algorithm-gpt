The `OONTweetScalingScorer` object is a Scala implementation of a scorer that scales the scores of out-of-network tweets by a specified scale factor. This object is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The object imports several classes from the `com.twitter` package, including `Scorer`, `Feature`, `FeatureMap`, `FeatureMapBuilder`, `CandidateWithFeatures`, and `Stitch`. These classes are used to define and manipulate features and scores of tweet candidates. 

The `OONTweetScalingScorer` object extends the `Scorer` trait, which requires the implementation of the `apply` method. This method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects as input and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`. The `apply` method maps over the `candidates` sequence and applies a scaling factor of 0.75 to the score of each out-of-network tweet. The updated score is then added to a new `FeatureMap` object and returned as part of a sequence of `FeatureMap` objects. 

The `OONTweetScalingScorer` object also defines a private method called `selector` that takes a `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` object as input and returns a Boolean value. This method is used to determine whether the scaling factor should be applied to a tweet candidate. The method returns `true` if the tweet candidate is an out-of-network tweet that is not an in-network retweet of an out-of-network tweet. 

Overall, the purpose of this code is to provide a scoring mechanism for tweet candidates that scales the scores of out-of-network tweets by a specified factor. This scorer can be used as part of a larger pipeline to rank and select tweet candidates for display to users. 

Example usage:

```
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(CandidateWithFeatures(tweetCandidate1), CandidateWithFeatures(tweetCandidate2), ...)
val scorer = OONTweetScalingScorer
val featureMaps = scorer(query, candidates).get
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a scorer component for a Twitter home feed algorithm. Specifically, it scales the scores of out-of-network tweets by a specified factor.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects, and returns a `Stitch` object containing a sequence of `FeatureMap` objects.

3. What is the significance of the `selector` method?
- The `selector` method is a private helper method that determines whether the score multiplier should be applied to a given tweet candidate. It returns `true` if the candidate is an out-of-network tweet that is not an in-network retweet of an out-of-network tweet.
