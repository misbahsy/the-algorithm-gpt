[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/home-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/home_mixer/functional_component/decorator/UnfollowUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder.scala)

The code defines a Scala case class called `UnfollowUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder` that is used to build a `ChildFeedbackAction` object. This class takes in a `FeatureMap` object as input and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction` object. The purpose of this class is to build a feedback action that allows a user to unfollow another user on Twitter.

The `FeatureMap` object contains information about the user that the feedback action is being built for. Specifically, it contains information about whether the user is in the same network as the current user (`isInNetwork`), the user's ID (`userIdOpt`), and the user's screen name (`screenNamesMap`).

If the user is in the same network as the current user, the feedback action is built. The feedback action consists of a prompt and a confirmation message that are displayed to the user when they attempt to unfollow the other user. The prompt and confirmation messages are built using the `StringCenter` object and the `HomeMixerExternalStrings` object. The `StringCenter` object is used to retrieve localized strings for the prompt and confirmation messages, while the `HomeMixerExternalStrings` object contains the keys for these strings.

The feedback action also includes an icon (`Unfollow`) and a `RichFeedbackBehaviorToggleFollowUser` object that specifies the user ID of the user being unfollowed. The `RichFeedbackBehaviorToggleFollowUser` object is used to update the state of the follow button after the user has been unfollowed.

Overall, this code is used to build a feedback action that allows a user to unfollow another user on Twitter. It is part of a larger project that likely includes other components for managing user interactions on the platform. Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val featureMap = FeatureMap(
  InNetworkFeature -> true,
  AuthorIdFeature -> Some(12345),
  ScreenNamesFeature -> Map(12345 -> "example_user")
)

val builder = UnfollowUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder(stringCenter, externalStrings)
val feedbackAction = builder(featureMap)

// Use the feedback action to display a prompt and confirmation message to the user
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala case class that builds a child feedback action for unfollowing a user in the Twitter home mixer product. It solves the problem of providing a prompt and confirmation message for unfollowing a user.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.product.following.model.HomeMixerExternalStrings`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.icon`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata.ChildFeedbackAction`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata.RichBehavior`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata.RichFeedbackBehaviorToggleFollowUser`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.product.guice.scope.ProductScoped`, `com.twitter.stringcenter.client.StringCenter`, `javax.inject.Inject`, and `javax.inject.Singleton`.

3. What input does the `apply` method take and what output does it produce?
- The `apply` method takes a `candidateFeatures` parameter of type `FeatureMap` and returns an `Option[ChildFeedbackAction]`. The `FeatureMap` is used to extract the `InNetworkFeature`, `AuthorIdFeature`, and `ScreenNamesFeature` values, which are used to build the child feedback action for unfollowing a user. The `Option[ChildFeedbackAction]` output is either `Some(action)` if the `isInNetwork` value is true and `userIdOpt` is defined, or `None` otherwise.
