The `ExtendedReplySocialContextBuilder` class is a decorator for the `BaseSocialContextBuilder` class, which is used to build social context metadata for tweets in the Twitter home timeline. This decorator is responsible for adding an "extended reply" banner to tweets that meet certain criteria.

The `apply` method takes a `PipelineQuery`, a `TweetCandidate`, and a `FeatureMap` as input, and returns an optional `SocialContext` object. If the tweet is a root tweet (i.e. not a reply to another tweet), and the root tweet is out-of-network while the reply is in-network, an extended reply banner is added to the tweet. The banner includes the name of the author of the original tweet, and a link to the tweet.

The `ExtendedReplySocialContextBuilder` class is injected with an instance of `HomeMixerExternalStrings`, which provides externalized strings for the banner text, and an instance of `StringCenter`, which is used to prepare the banner text with placeholders for the author's name.

This class is used in the larger project to enhance the user experience of the Twitter home timeline by providing additional context for tweets that are part of a conversation. By adding an extended reply banner to tweets that meet certain criteria, users can quickly see who the original author of a conversation was, and easily navigate to the original tweet. 

Example usage:

```
val builder = ExtendedReplySocialContextBuilder(externalStrings, stringCenterProvider)
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidate = TweetCandidate(...)
val features = FeatureMap(...)
val socialContext = builder(query, candidate, features)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a Scala class that builds a social context for a tweet candidate in a pipeline query. It is used to determine whether to show an extended reply banner for a root tweet that is out-of-network and has a reply in-network.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they injected?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `HomeMixerExternalStrings`, `StringCenter`, and `FeatureMap`. These dependencies are injected using the `@Inject` and `@ProductScoped` annotations.

3. What is the expected behavior of this code and how is it enforced?
- This code is expected to only be called for the root tweet of convo modules, as enforced by the `HomeTweetSocialContextBuilder`. It is also expected to return an optional social context based on the input parameters, and will default to not showing an extended reply banner if certain values are missing.
