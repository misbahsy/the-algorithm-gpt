The code defines a class called `ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder` that is responsible for building a child feedback action for reporting a tweet. The class takes in a `TweetCandidate` object and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction` object. 

The `ChildFeedbackAction` object is a part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.metadata` package and represents an action that can be taken by a user in response to a prompt. The `ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class builds this object by setting various properties such as the feedback type, prompt, confirmation, feedback URL, icon, and so on. 

The `apply` method of the class takes in a `TweetCandidate` object and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction` object. The `TweetCandidate` object is a part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model.candidate` package and represents a candidate tweet that can be displayed to a user. 

The `ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class is used in the larger project to provide a way for users to report tweets. The `ChildFeedbackAction` object built by this class can be used to prompt the user to report a tweet and provide feedback on why they are reporting it. The `ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class is injected with a `StringCenter` object and an `HomeMixerExternalStrings` object, which are used to prepare the prompt for reporting a tweet. 

Example usage of this class would be as follows:

```
val tweetCandidate = TweetCandidate(id = "12345", text = "This is a tweet")
val reportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder = ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder(stringCenter, externalStrings)
val reportTweetAction = reportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder(tweetCandidate)
```

In this example, a `TweetCandidate` object is created with an ID of "12345" and some text. The `ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder` object is then created with the necessary dependencies injected. Finally, the `apply` method of the `ReportTweetChildFeedbackActionBuilder` object is called with the `TweetCandidate` object as a parameter, which returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction` object that can be used to prompt the user to report the tweet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a Scala case class that builds a ChildFeedbackAction object for reporting a tweet. It is part of the functional_component.decorator package in the Home Mixer product of Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they being used? 
- This code imports several classes from the product_mixer package and injects a StringCenter object and a HomeMixerExternalStrings object. These dependencies are used to construct the ChildFeedbackAction object.

3. What is the expected output of this code and how is it used in the rest of the project? 
- The expected output of this code is an Option[ChildFeedbackAction] object that can be used to report a tweet. It is likely used in other parts of the Home Mixer product to provide users with the ability to report tweets.
