The `HomeScribeClientEventSideEffect` class is a side effect that logs served tweet metrics to Scribe as client events. This class extends the `ScribeClientEventSideEffect` class and overrides its methods to build client events and set the identifier and page. 

The `buildClientEvents` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, selected and remaining candidates, dropped candidates, and a `Timeline` response. It uses the `CandidatesUtil` object to get the item candidates from the selected candidates and group them by source. It then gets the injected tweets and promoted tweets from the sources using the injected tweets candidate pipeline identifiers and ads candidate pipeline identifier respectively. If the whoToFollow candidate pipeline identifier is present, it gets the whoToFollow users from the sources. It then uses the `ServedEventsBuilder`, `EmptyTimelineEventsBuilder`, and `QueryEventsBuilder` objects to build the served events, empty timeline events, and query events respectively. It filters out events with negative event values and returns the remaining events.

The `identifier` and `page` values are set to "HomeScribeClientEvent" and "timelinemixer" respectively. The `alerts` value is set to a sequence containing a default success rate alert for business hours.

This class is used in the larger project to log served tweet metrics to Scribe as client events. It is likely used in conjunction with other components to track and analyze user behavior and improve the quality of the Twitter timeline. 

Example usage:
```
val sideEffect = HomeScribeClientEventSideEffect(
  logPipelinePublisher = eventPublisher,
  injectedTweetsCandidatePipelineIdentifiers = Seq(candidatePipelineIdentifier),
  adsCandidatePipelineIdentifier = adsCandidatePipelineIdentifier,
  whoToFollowCandidatePipelineIdentifier = Some(whoToFollowCandidatePipelineIdentifier)
)

val clientEvents = sideEffect.buildClientEvents(
  query = pipelineQuery,
  selectedCandidates = selectedCandidates,
  remainingCandidates = remainingCandidates,
  droppedCandidates = droppedCandidates,
  response = timeline
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a side effect that logs served tweet metrics to Scribe as client events, and includes methods for building client events and defining alerts.

2. What other components or libraries does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other components and libraries, including `com.twitter.clientapp.thriftscala.LogEvent`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.service.HomeMixerAlertConfig`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.util.CandidatesUtil`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.side_effect.ScribeClientEventSideEffect`.

3. Are there any optional parameters in this code, and if so, what are they used for?
- Yes, there is an optional parameter called `whoToFollowCandidatePipelineIdentifier`, which is used to specify a candidate pipeline identifier for the "WhoToFollow" module. This module is not required for all home-mixer products, so this parameter allows for flexibility in specifying which products should include it.
