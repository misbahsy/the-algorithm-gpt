The `StaleTweetsCacheCandidateSource` class is a candidate source implementation for retrieving stale tweets from a Memcached cache. It extends the `CandidateSource` trait, which defines a method for retrieving candidate items based on a request. In this case, the request is a sequence of tweet IDs represented as `Long` values.

The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It is also injected with a `MemcachedClient` instance named `StaleTweetsCache`, which is used to retrieve the stale tweets from the cache.

The `apply` method is the implementation of the `CandidateSource` trait's method. It takes a sequence of tweet IDs as input and returns a `Stitch` object that represents a future computation of the result. The method first constructs a sequence of cache keys by prefixing each tweet ID with the string "v1_". It then calls the `get` method on the `staleTweetsCache` instance to retrieve the values associated with these keys. The result is a map of cache keys to tweet values, represented as tuples of `(String, Array[Byte])`. The method maps over this map to extract the tweet IDs and convert them back to `Long` values. Finally, it returns a `Stitch` object that wraps the resulting sequence of tweet IDs.

This implementation can be used as a candidate source in a larger system that needs to retrieve stale tweets from a cache. For example, it could be used in a recommendation system that recommends tweets to users based on their interests. The system could use this candidate source to retrieve a set of stale tweets that match the user's interests, and then use a ranking algorithm to select the most relevant tweets to recommend to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a candidate source for stale tweets using a Memcached client. It solves the problem of retrieving a sequence of stale tweets from the cache.

2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` annotation and how does it affect the behavior of the code?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. This affects the behavior of the code by ensuring that all requests for this candidate source will use the same instance.

3. What is the role of the `Stitch` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `Stitch` class is used to compose and execute asynchronous operations. In this code, it is used to call the `get` method of the Memcached client and map the resulting tweets to a sequence of long integers.
