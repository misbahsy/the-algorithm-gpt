The code defines a configuration class for the parameters used in the List Recommended Users feature of the Twitter home mixer product. The class is located in the `com.twitter.home_mixer.product.list_recommended_users.param` package and extends the `ProductParamConfig` class. It is annotated with `@Singleton` and `@Inject` to indicate that it is a singleton and can be injected into other classes.

The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for configuring the parameters used in the List Recommended Users feature. It defines the `enabledDeciderKey` and `supportedClientFSName` properties, which are used to determine whether the feature is enabled and which client file system is supported, respectively. It also defines the `boundedIntFSOverrides` property, which is a sequence of parameters that are bounded integers and can be overridden by the file system.

An example of how this class may be used in the larger project is in the implementation of the List Recommended Users feature. The feature may use the `ListRecommendedUsersParamConfig` class to retrieve the configured parameters and use them to determine which users to recommend to the user. For example, the `ServerMaxResultsParam` parameter may be used to limit the number of recommended users returned by the server, while the `ExcludedIdsMaxLengthParam` parameter may be used to limit the length of the excluded user IDs list.

Overall, the `ListRecommendedUsersParamConfig` class provides a centralized and configurable way to manage the parameters used in the List Recommended Users feature of the Twitter home mixer product.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is defining a configuration class for a product called ListRecommendedUsersParam in the Twitter home mixer. It sets certain parameters and overrides for this product.
2. What other classes or files does this code interact with?
   - This code imports several classes from other packages, including DeciderKey and ProductParamConfig. It also references other classes within the ListRecommendedUsersParam package.
3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations?
   - The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected by a dependency injection framework.
