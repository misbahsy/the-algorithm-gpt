The `TopicSocialContextBuilder` class is a functional component decorator that is used to build social context metadata for a `TweetCandidate` object in the Twitter product mixer. The purpose of this code is to determine if a tweet candidate is in-network or not, and if it is not, to extract the topic ID and functionality type from the candidate's features and use them to create a `TopicContext` object that is added to the social context metadata.

The `TopicSocialContextBuilder` class extends the `BaseSocialContextBuilder` class and takes in a `PipelineQuery` object, a `TweetCandidate` object, and a `FeatureMap` object as input parameters. It returns an optional `SocialContext` object that contains the topic context metadata.

The `apply` method is the main method of the class and takes in the input parameters. It first checks if the tweet candidate is in-network or not by checking the value of the `InNetworkFeature` feature in the `candidateFeatures` map. If the candidate is not in-network, it extracts the topic ID and functionality type from the `candidateFeatures` map using the `TopicIdSocialContextFeature` and `TopicContextFunctionalityTypeFeature` keys respectively. It then creates a `TopicContext` object using these values and returns it as a `Some` object wrapped in an optional. If either of the feature values is missing, it returns `None`.

If the candidate is in-network, the method returns `None` directly.

This code is used in the larger Twitter product mixer project to add social context metadata to tweet candidates. The `TopicSocialContextBuilder` class is one of several functional component decorators that are used to build different types of social context metadata for tweet candidates. The social context metadata is used to provide additional context to the tweet and to help improve the relevance of the tweet in the user's timeline. 

Example usage:

```scala
val topicSocialContextBuilder = TopicSocialContextBuilder()
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidate = TweetCandidate(...)
val candidateFeatures = FeatureMap(...)
val socialContext = topicSocialContextBuilder(query, candidate, candidateFeatures)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a Scala case class that extends a base social context builder. It is used to build a social context object for a tweet candidate based on certain features. It likely fits into a larger project related to Twitter's home mixer or product mixer.

2. What are the dependencies for this code and how are they imported?
- This code imports several dependencies from other packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core`. These dependencies are imported using the `import` keyword.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a `TweetCandidate`, and a `FeatureMap`, and returns an optional `SocialContext` object. If the `inNetwork` feature is false, it will attempt to extract the `topicId` and `topicContextFunctionalityType` features from the `candidateFeatures` map and use them to create a `TopicContext` object within a `SocialContext`. If either of these features are missing, it will return `None`. If the `inNetwork` feature is true, it will simply return `None`.
