The `ServedCandidateKafkaSideEffect` object in the `side_effect` package is responsible for extracting a sequence of `ItemCandidateWithDetails` objects from a given `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects. The extracted candidates are filtered based on their source identifiers and whether they have a `StreamToKafkaFeature` feature set to `true`. The `ServedIdFeature` feature of each candidate is then set to either the value of the `PredictionRequestIdFeature` feature or the `ServedRequestIdFeature` feature of the `PipelineQuery` if the candidate has the `IsReadFromCacheFeature` feature set to `true` and the `ServedRequestIdFeature` feature is not empty. Finally, the extracted candidates are deduplicated based on their `candidateIdLong`, `getRequiredUserId`, and `ServedIdFeature` values.

This code is likely used in the larger project to extract a sequence of candidates that are eligible to be served to a user and have a `StreamToKafkaFeature` feature set to `true`. The extracted candidates are then processed further to set the `ServedIdFeature` feature to a value that uniquely identifies the candidate and is used for deduplication. The deduplicated candidates are likely used to generate a personalized feed for the user.

Here is an example usage of the `extractCandidates` method:

```scala
import com.twitter.home_mixer.functional_component.side_effect.ServedCandidateKafkaSideEffect

val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val selectedCandidates = Seq(...)
val sourceIdentifiers = Set(...)

val servedCandidates = ServedCandidateKafkaSideEffect.extractCandidates(query, selectedCandidates, sourceIdentifiers)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    - This code defines a Scala object called `ServedCandidateKafkaSideEffect` that contains a method called `extractCandidates`. The method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails`, and a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` as input and returns a sequence of `ItemCandidateWithDetails`.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    - This code imports several classes from other packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.CandidatePipelineIdentifier`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.presentation.CandidateWithDetails`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.presentation.ItemCandidateWithDetails`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.presentation.ModuleCandidateWithDetails`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery`.
3. What is the purpose of the `groupBy` and `map` operations in the `extractCandidates` method?
    - The `groupBy` operation groups the `ItemCandidateWithDetails` objects in the sequence by a tuple of `(tweetId, userId, servedId)`. The `map` operation then takes the first element of each group and returns a sequence of those elements, effectively deduplicating the sequence based on those three values.
