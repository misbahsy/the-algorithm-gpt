The `FollowedBySocialContextBuilder` class is a decorator that adds social context to a `TweetCandidate` object based on the users who follow the author of the tweet. This decorator is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this decorator is to provide additional context to a tweet by showing who follows the author of the tweet. This is done by checking if the tweet is an out-of-network (OON) tweet, meaning it was authored by someone outside of the user's network. If it is an OON tweet, the decorator retrieves the list of valid user IDs who follow the author of the tweet and passes them to an `EngagerSocialContextBuilder` object to generate the social context. If the tweet is not an OON tweet, no social context is added.

The `FollowedBySocialContextBuilder` class takes in an `externalStrings` object and a `stringCenterProvider` object as constructor parameters. The `externalStrings` object contains strings used to generate the social context, while the `stringCenterProvider` object provides access to a `StringCenter` object used to retrieve localized strings.

The `apply` method is the main method of the decorator. It takes in a `PipelineQuery` object, a `TweetCandidate` object, and a `FeatureMap` object as parameters. The `PipelineQuery` object is used to retrieve additional information about the tweet, while the `TweetCandidate` object represents the tweet being decorated. The `FeatureMap` object contains additional features of the tweet, such as whether it is an OON tweet and the list of valid user IDs who follow the author of the tweet.

The `apply` method first checks if the tweet is an OON tweet by retrieving the value of the `InNetworkFeature` feature from the `FeatureMap` object. If it is not an OON tweet, the method retrieves the list of valid user IDs who follow the author of the tweet from the `SGSValidFollowedByUserIdsFeature` feature of the `FeatureMap` object. It then passes these user IDs to the `engagerSocialContextBuilder` object to generate the social context. If the tweet is an OON tweet, no social context is added and the method returns `None`.

Overall, the `FollowedBySocialContextBuilder` decorator adds social context to a tweet by showing who follows the author of the tweet. It is used in the larger project to enhance the user experience by providing additional context to tweets. An example of how this decorator may be used is in a Twitter timeline where tweets from users outside of the user's network are displayed with social context showing who follows the author of the tweet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a Scala class that builds social context for a tweet candidate in the Twitter Home Mixer product. It is part of a larger functional component decorator package.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.product.following.model.HomeMixerExternalStrings`, and `com.twitter.stringcenter.client.StringCenter`.

3. What is the logic behind when social context is applied to a tweet candidate?
- Social context is only applied to tweet candidates that are not in the user's network. If a candidate is in the user's network, no social context is applied. If a candidate is not in the user's network, the social context is built using the `EngagerSocialContextBuilder` and valid followed-by user IDs.
