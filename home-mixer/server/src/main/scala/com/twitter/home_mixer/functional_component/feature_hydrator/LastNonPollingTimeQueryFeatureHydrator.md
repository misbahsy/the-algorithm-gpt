The `LastNonPollingTimeQueryFeatureHydrator` class is a query feature hydrator that is used to hydrate features related to non-polling times for a user. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to retrieve non-polling time features for a user. Non-polling times are the times when a user is not actively using Twitter, and the app is not polling for new data. The features that are hydrated by this class include `FollowingLastNonPollingTimeFeature`, `LastNonPollingTimeFeature`, and `NonPollingTimesFeature`. 

The `hydrate` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object as input and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object. The `PipelineQuery` object contains information about the user whose features are being hydrated. The `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object contains the hydrated features for the user. 

The `hydrate` method retrieves non-polling time data for the user from the `userSessionStore`. It then uses this data to calculate the `FollowingLastNonPollingTimeFeature`, `LastNonPollingTimeFeature`, and `NonPollingTimesFeature`. These features are added to a `FeatureMap` object using the `FeatureMapBuilder` class. The `FeatureMap` object is then returned as the result of the `hydrate` method. 

The `alerts` property of the class is a sequence of `HomeMixerAlertConfig` objects. These objects are used to configure alerts for the non-polling time features. The default alert is set to trigger when the success rate of the feature is below 99.9%. 

This code can be used in the larger project to provide non-polling time features for users. These features can be used to improve the user experience by providing more relevant content during non-polling times. For example, the `LastNonPollingTimeFeature` can be used to show the user the most recent content that was posted while they were not actively using Twitter. The `NonPollingTimesFeature` can be used to identify patterns in the user's non-polling times and adjust the content accordingly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a query feature hydrator for a pipeline query that retrieves non-polling times for a user. It solves the problem of retrieving non-polling times from a user session store.

2. What dependencies does this code have? 
- This code has dependencies on several packages and classes, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, and `com.twitter.user_session_store`.

3. What is the expected output of the `hydrate` method? 
- The `hydrate` method is expected to return a `Stitch` of a `FeatureMap`, which contains the following features: `FollowingLastNonPollingTimeFeature`, `LastNonPollingTimeFeature`, and `NonPollingTimesFeature`. The `FeatureMap` is built using data retrieved from a user session store.
