The `HomeMixerDebugParamsUnmarshaller` class is responsible for unmarshalling debug parameters for the Home Mixer service. The purpose of this class is to convert the Thrift `DebugParams` object into a `DebugParams` object that can be used by the Home Mixer service. 

The `HomeMixerDebugParamsUnmarshaller` class takes in a `FeatureValueUnmarshaller` object as a dependency, which is used to unmarshall feature values. The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application.

The `apply` method is the main method of this class, which takes in a `DebugParams` object and returns a `DebugParams` object. The method first unmarshalls the `featureOverrides` field of the `DebugParams` object by mapping over the key-value pairs of the map and applying the `featureValueUnmarshaller` to each value. The resulting map is then converted to a new map with the same keys but with the unmarshalled values. 

The method then unmarshalls the `debugOptions` field of the `DebugParams` object by mapping over the `requestTimeOverrideMillis` field and converting it to a `Time` object. The resulting `HomeMixerDebugOptions` object is then returned as part of the final `DebugParams` object.

This class is used in the larger Home Mixer service to unmarshall debug parameters for incoming requests. For example, if a client sends a request with debug parameters, the `HomeMixerDebugParamsUnmarshaller` class will be used to convert those parameters into a format that can be used by the Home Mixer service. 

Example usage:

```
val debugParams = t.DebugParams(
  featureOverrides = Map("feature1" -> "value1", "feature2" -> "value2"),
  debugOptions = Some(t.HomeMixerDebugOptions(requestTimeOverrideMillis = Some(123456789)))
)

val unmarshaller = new HomeMixerDebugParamsUnmarshaller(new FeatureValueUnmarshaller())

val result = unmarshaller(debugParams)

// result is a DebugParams object with unmarshalled featureOverrides and debugOptions fields
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that unmarshals debug parameters for the HomeMixer service from Twitter. It takes in a `DebugParams` object and returns a `DebugParams` object with feature overrides and debug options.
2. What other dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including `HomeMixerDebugOptions`, `FeatureValueUnmarshaller`, `DebugParams`, `Time`, and `t.DebugParams`. It also imports several packages from other modules.
3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject()` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject()` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
