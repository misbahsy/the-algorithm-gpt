The `TweetTextFeaturesExtractor` object contains methods for extracting various text features from a tweet. These features include whether the tweet contains a question mark, the length of the tweet, the number of capital letters in the tweet, the number of white spaces in the tweet, and the number of newlines in the tweet. 

The `addTextFeaturesFromTweet` method takes in an existing `ContentFeatures` object and a `tp.Tweet` object, and returns a new `ContentFeatures` object with the text features extracted from the tweet added to it. If the `tp.Tweet` object does not contain `coreData`, the method simply returns the original `ContentFeatures` object. 

The `getLength`, `getCaps`, `getSpaces`, and `hasQuestionCharacter` methods are helper methods used by `addTextFeaturesFromTweet` to extract the various text features. `getLength` uses the `codePointCount` method to count the number of Unicode code points in the tweet text. `getCaps` uses the `count` method to count the number of uppercase letters in the tweet text. `getSpaces` uses the `count` method to count the number of whitespace characters in the tweet text. `hasQuestionCharacter` checks whether the tweet text contains any of the characters in the `QUESTION_MARK_CHARS` set, which contains various Unicode characters that can represent a question mark.

The `getNumNewlines` method is another helper method that takes in a string and returns the number of newlines in the string. It uses a regular expression to match newline characters, and then uses the `length` method to count the number of matches.

Overall, this code is used to extract various text features from a tweet, which can be used for various purposes such as sentiment analysis or content classification. The `addTextFeaturesFromTweet` method can be called on a stream of tweets to extract the text features from each tweet and add them to a `ContentFeatures` object, which can then be used for further analysis. For example:

```
val tweet: tp.Tweet = ...
val inputFeatures: ContentFeatures = ...
val featuresWithText: ContentFeatures = TweetTextFeaturesExtractor.addTextFeaturesFromTweet(inputFeatures, tweet)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines an object called `TweetTextFeaturesExtractor` that contains methods for extracting various features from a tweet's text, such as its length, number of capital letters, and number of newlines.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code depends on the `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.ContentFeatures` and `com.twitter.tweetypie.thriftscala.tp.Tweet` classes, which are imported at the beginning of the file.

3. What is the significance of the `QUESTION_MARK_CHARS` constant?
    
    The `QUESTION_MARK_CHARS` constant is a set of Unicode characters that represent various types of question marks. The `hasQuestionCharacter` method uses this set to determine whether a given string contains any question marks.
