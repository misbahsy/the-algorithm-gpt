The `SGSValidSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that takes in liked-by and followed-by user ids and checks via SGS (Social Graph Service) that the viewer is following the engager, that the viewer is not blocking the engager, that the engager is not blocking the viewer, and that the viewer has not muted the engager. 

This class extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class and overrides its `apply` method to apply the SGS validation to the given candidates. The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`. The `FeatureMap` is a map of features to their values for a given candidate. 

The `SGSValidSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class has two features: `SGSValidFollowedByUserIdsFeature` and `SGSValidLikedByUserIdsFeature`. These features are used to filter the liked-by and followed-by user ids based on the SGS validation. 

The `getValidUserIds` method takes in a viewer id and a sequence of social proof user ids and returns a `Stitch[Seq[Long]]` of valid user ids based on the SGS validation. The `viewerId` is the id of the viewer, and the `socialProofUserIds` are the user ids of the social proof users. The `sg.IdsRequest` is used to make a request to the SGS to get the valid user ids based on the viewer id and the social proof user ids. 

The `apply` method first gets all the social context user ids from the given candidates. It then calls the `getValidUserIds` method to get the valid user ids based on the viewer id and the social context user ids. It then filters the liked-by and followed-by user ids based on the valid user ids and creates a `FeatureMap` for each candidate with the filtered liked-by and followed-by user ids. 

This class is used in the larger project to validate the social context of the liked-by and followed-by user ids. The validated user ids are then used to filter the candidates based on the SGS validation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a feature hydrator that takes liked-by and followed-by user ids and checks via SGS that the viewer is following the engager, that the viewer is not blocking the engager, that the engager is not blocking the viewer, and that the viewer has not muted the engager. It solves the problem of ensuring that the social context of a tweet is valid before displaying it to the viewer.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method? 
- The `apply` method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` as inputs, and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]` as output.

3. What is the purpose of the `getValidUserIds` method? 
- The `getValidUserIds` method takes a viewer ID and a sequence of social proof user IDs as inputs, and returns a `Stitch[Seq[Long]]` as output. It is used to retrieve the valid user IDs based on the social graph relationships between the viewer and the social proof users.
