[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/home-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/home_mixer/product/following/model/HomeMixerExternalStrings.scala)

The code defines a class called `HomeMixerExternalStrings` that is responsible for creating and managing external strings used in the Twitter Home Mixer product. The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application.

The class has a constructor that takes a `Provider` of `ExternalStringRegistry` as an argument. The `ExternalStringRegistry` is a client used to create and manage external strings. The `Provider` is used to lazily initialize the `ExternalStringRegistry` when needed.

The class has several properties, each of which is an external string used in the Home Mixer product. Each property is initialized by calling the `createProdString` method on the `ExternalStringRegistry` instance obtained from the `Provider`. The string values are hardcoded and represent various feedback messages and social context strings used in the product.

This class is likely used throughout the Home Mixer product to provide localized and consistent feedback messages and social context strings. For example, the `muteUserString` property might be used to display a message when a user mutes another user's tweets. The `socialContextOneUserLikedString` property might be used to display a social context message when one user likes a tweet. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
val externalStrings = HomeMixerExternalStrings(externalStringRegistryProvider)

// Display a message when a user mutes another user's tweets
val muteUserMessage = externalStrings.muteUserString.localizedString(userToMute.username)
displayMessage(muteUserMessage)

// Display a social context message when one user likes a tweet
val socialContextMessage = when (numLikes) {
  1 -> externalStrings.socialContextOneUserLikedString.localizedString(likedByUser.username)
  2 -> externalStrings.socialContextTwoUsersLikedString.localizedString(likedByUser1.username, likedByUser2.username)
  else -> externalStrings.socialContextMoreUsersLikedString.localizedString(numLikes)
}
displaySocialContext(socialContextMessage)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `HomeMixerExternalStrings` that creates and initializes various string constants using an `ExternalStringRegistry` object.

2. What is the role of the `ExternalStringRegistry` object?
- The `ExternalStringRegistry` object is used to create and manage string constants that are used throughout the application.

3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` annotation?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the `HomeMixerExternalStrings` class will be created and shared across the entire application.
