The `ScoredTweetsParamConfig` class is a configuration class that defines various parameters for the scored tweets product in the Twitter home mixer. The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for defining the various parameters that are used by the scored tweets product. 

The class extends the `ProductParamConfig` class, which is a base class for defining product parameters. The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. 

The class defines various parameter overrides for different types of parameters, such as boolean, bounded integer, bounded duration, string, bounded double, long set, and string sequence parameters. Each override specifies a parameter key and a default value. 

For example, the `booleanDeciderOverrides` sequence defines boolean parameters that override the default values for certain deciders. The `boundedIntFSOverrides` sequence defines bounded integer parameters that override the default values for certain file system parameters. Similarly, other sequences define overrides for other types of parameters. 

Overall, this class provides a way to configure the various parameters used by the scored tweets product in the Twitter home mixer. By defining these parameters in a centralized location, it makes it easier to manage and modify them as needed. 

Example usage:

```
val scoredTweetsParamConfig = new ScoredTweetsParamConfig()
scoredTweetsParamConfig.booleanDeciderOverrides.foreach(println)
scoredTweetsParamConfig.boundedIntFSOverrides.foreach(println)
scoredTweetsParamConfig.boundedDurationFSOverrides.foreach(println)
scoredTweetsParamConfig.stringFSOverrides.foreach(println)
scoredTweetsParamConfig.boundedDoubleFSOverrides.foreach(println)
scoredTweetsParamConfig.longSetFSOverrides.foreach(println)
scoredTweetsParamConfig.stringSeqFSOverrides.foreach(println)
``` 

This example creates a new instance of the `ScoredTweetsParamConfig` class and prints out the various parameter overrides defined in the class.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration class for a product called ScoredTweetsParam in a Twitter home mixer project. It specifies various overrides for different types of parameters.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.param.decider.DeciderKey`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.product.ProductParamConfig`, and `javax.inject.Inject`.
3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the `ScoredTweetsParamConfig` class should be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
