The code defines a class called `DontLikeFeedbackActionBuilder` that is responsible for building a feedback action object for a tweet candidate that a user has marked as "don't like". The feedback action object contains information about the user's feedback and can be used to improve the relevance of future tweet candidates shown to the user. 

The `DontLikeFeedbackActionBuilder` class has an `apply` method that takes in a `PipelineQuery` object, a `TweetCandidate` object, and a `FeatureMap` object. It returns an optional `FeedbackAction` object. The `PipelineQuery` object contains information about the query that generated the tweet candidate, the `TweetCandidate` object contains information about the tweet candidate itself, and the `FeatureMap` object contains information about the features of the tweet candidate.

The `apply` method first extracts the original author ID of the tweet candidate from the `FeatureMap` object. It then creates a `FeedbackMetadata` object that contains information about the tweet candidate and the user's feedback. It also creates a feedback URL that can be used to submit the feedback to a feedback service. 

The `apply` method then creates a sequence of child feedback actions based on the `EnableNahFeedbackInfoParam` parameter in the `PipelineQuery` object. If the parameter is true, the child feedback actions include unfollowing, muting, blocking, and reporting the tweet candidate. If the parameter is false, the child feedback actions include providing feedback on the author, retweeter, and relevance of the tweet candidate.

Finally, the `apply` method creates a `FeedbackAction` object that contains information about the user's feedback, the child feedback actions, the feedback URL, and other metadata. The `FeedbackAction` object can be used to update the relevance of future tweet candidates shown to the user.

Example usage:

```scala
val builder = new DontLikeFeedbackActionBuilder(...)
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidate = TweetCandidate(...)
val features = FeatureMap(...)
val feedbackAction = builder(query, candidate, features)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a Scala implementation of a feedback action builder for the "Don't Like" feature in Twitter's Home Mixer product. It allows users to provide feedback on tweets they don't like and provides options for additional actions based on user preferences.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use? 
- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including `com.twitter.conversions.DurationOps`, `com.twitter.stringcenter.client.StringCenter`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery`.

3. What is the role of the `@Singleton` annotation and how does it affect the behavior of this code? 
- The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. This can help improve performance and reduce memory usage by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
