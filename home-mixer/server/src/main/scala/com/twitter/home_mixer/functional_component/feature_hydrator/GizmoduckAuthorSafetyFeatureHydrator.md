The `GizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that retrieves the blue verification status of a tweet's author using the Gizmoduck API. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves analyzing and processing tweets to improve the user experience on the platform.

The class extends the `CandidateFeatureHydrator` class, which is a functional component that adds features to a tweet candidate. It also implements the `Conditionally` trait, which allows it to conditionally apply the feature hydrator based on a `PipelineQuery` parameter.

The `GizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydrator` class retrieves the blue verification status of a tweet's author by making a call to the `getUserById` method of the `Gizmoduck` API. It first checks if the `EnableGizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydratorParam` parameter is set to true in the `PipelineQuery` object. If it is, it retrieves the author ID from the existing features of the tweet candidate and uses it to make a call to the `getUserById` method. It then maps the result to a boolean value indicating whether the author is blue verified or not.

Finally, the class creates a new `FeatureMap` object with the `AuthorIsBlueVerifiedFeature` feature set to the boolean value retrieved from the API call. This `FeatureMap` object is returned as a `Stitch` object, which is a monadic type that allows for asynchronous and error-handling operations.

Overall, the `GizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that retrieves the blue verification status of a tweet's author using the Gizmoduck API. It is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves analyzing and processing tweets to improve the user experience on the platform. Below is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val tweetCandidate: TweetCandidate = // create a tweet candidate
val pipelineQuery: PipelineQuery = // create a pipeline query with relevant parameters

val featureHydrator: GizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydrator = // create a new instance of the feature hydrator
val existingFeatures: FeatureMap = // get existing features of the tweet candidate

val result: Stitch[FeatureMap] = featureHydrator.apply(pipelineQuery, tweetCandidate, existingFeatures)
// asynchronously retrieve the blue verification status of the tweet's author and add it as a new feature to the tweet candidate
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a feature hydrator for a Twitter home feed algorithm called GizmoduckAuthorSafety, which retrieves safety-related information about tweet authors from the Gizmoduck service and adds the AuthorIsBlueVerifiedFeature to the tweet candidate's feature map.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including com.twitter.gizmoduck.thriftscala, com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures, com.twitter.home_mixer.param.HomeGlobalParams, com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model.candidate.TweetCandidate, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator.CandidateFeatureHydrator, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.Conditionally, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.FeatureHydratorIdentifier, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery, com.twitter.stitch.Stitch, and com.twitter.stitch.gizmoduck.Gizmoduck.

3. What is the logic behind the onlyIf method?
- The onlyIf method returns true if the EnableGizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydratorParam parameter is set to true in the given PipelineQuery object, indicating that the GizmoduckAuthorSafety feature hydrator should be applied to the tweet candidate. Otherwise, it returns false and the feature hydrator is skipped.
