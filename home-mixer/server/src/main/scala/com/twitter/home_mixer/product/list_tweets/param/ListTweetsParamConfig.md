The `ListTweetsParamConfig` class is a configuration class for the List Tweets product in the Twitter home mixer. It extends the `ProductParamConfig` class and is annotated with `@Singleton` and `@Inject` to indicate that it is a singleton and can be injected into other classes.

The purpose of this class is to provide configuration parameters for the List Tweets product, such as the maximum number of results that can be returned by the server and whether or not to enable the ads candidate pipeline. These parameters are defined as constants in the `ListTweetsParam` object.

The `ListTweetsParamConfig` class overrides the `enabledDeciderKey` and `supportedClientFSName` properties from the `ProductParamConfig` class to specify the decider key for enabling the List Tweets product and the supported client file system name, respectively.

The class also overrides the `booleanFSOverrides` and `boundedIntFSOverrides` properties to specify the boolean and integer parameters that can be overridden by the client file system. For example, the `EnableAdsCandidatePipelineParam` parameter can be overridden by the client file system to enable or disable the ads candidate pipeline.

Overall, this class provides a centralized location for configuring the List Tweets product and allows for easy modification of its parameters. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the Twitter home mixer to provide a personalized and optimized user experience for Twitter users. 

Example usage:
```
val listTweetsParamConfig = new ListTweetsParamConfig()
val maxResults = listTweetsParamConfig.boundedIntFSOverrides(ServerMaxResultsParam)
val enableAdsPipeline = listTweetsParamConfig.booleanFSOverrides.contains(EnableAdsCandidatePipelineParam)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration class for a product called ListTweets, which includes parameters related to enabling ads and setting server max results.
2. What other classes or files does this code interact with?
   - This code imports classes from packages such as `com.twitter.home_mixer.param.decider` and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.product`, so it likely interacts with other classes in those packages.
3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created, while the `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
