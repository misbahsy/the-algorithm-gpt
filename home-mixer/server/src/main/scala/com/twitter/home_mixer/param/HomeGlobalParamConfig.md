[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/home-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/home_mixer/param/HomeGlobalParamConfig.scala)

The code defines a class called HomeGlobalParamConfig that extends GlobalParamConfig. This class is responsible for registering parameters that do not relate to a specific product. The purpose of this class is to provide hooks for registering parameters based on type. 

The class has four override values: booleanFSOverrides, boundedIntFSOverrides, boundedDoubleFSOverrides, and longSetFSOverrides. These values are sequences of parameters that are being overridden. 

The booleanFSOverrides sequence contains parameters that are boolean values. These parameters include AdsDisableInjectionBasedOnUserRoleParam, EnableSendScoresToClient, EnableNahFeedbackInfoParam, EnableNewTweetsPillAvatarsParam, EnableServedCandidateKafkaPublishingParam, EnableSocialContextParam, EnableGizmoduckAuthorSafetyFeatureHydratorParam, EnableAdvertiserBrandSafetySettingsFeatureHydratorParam, and EnableFeedbackFatigueParam. 

The boundedIntFSOverrides sequence contains parameters that are bounded integer values. These parameters include MaxNumberReplaceInstructionsParam and TimelinesPersistenceStoreMaxEntriesPerClient. 

The boundedDoubleFSOverrides sequence contains parameters that are bounded double values. These parameters include BlueVerifiedAuthorInNetworkMultiplierParam and BlueVerifiedAuthorOutOfNetworkMultiplierParam. 

The longSetFSOverrides sequence contains parameters that are long set values. The only parameter in this sequence is AuthorListForStatsParam. 

Overall, this code is used to register parameters for the HomeGlobalParams class. These parameters are used to configure various aspects of the algorithm used by Twitter. By providing hooks for registering parameters based on type, this class makes it easier to manage and configure the algorithm.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code registers global parameters that are not specific to a particular product in the Home Mixer project.

2. What is the significance of the annotations used in this code?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the `HomeGlobalParamConfig` class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor that will be used by the dependency injection framework.

3. What are the different types of parameter overrides being defined in this code?
- The code defines boolean, bounded integer, bounded double, and long set parameter overrides. These overrides are used to set default values for certain parameters that can be overridden at runtime.
