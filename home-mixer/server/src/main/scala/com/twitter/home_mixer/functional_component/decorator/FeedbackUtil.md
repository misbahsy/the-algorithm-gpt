The `FeedbackUtil` object in the `decorator` package provides a method for building a `ChildFeedbackAction` object that can be used to give feedback to Twitter's timeline service. Specifically, the `buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction` method takes in a user ID, a map of user IDs to screen names, two external strings for the prompt and confirmation messages, a feedback engagement type, a `StringCenter` object, and an optional injection type. It returns an `Option[ChildFeedbackAction]` object.

The purpose of this method is to allow users to provide feedback to Twitter's timeline service that they want to see fewer tweets from a particular user. The `ChildFeedbackAction` object contains information about the feedback type (in this case, `SeeFewer`), the prompt and confirmation messages, a feedback URL, and other metadata. The `FeedbackMetadata` object contains information about the engagement type, entity IDs (in this case, the user ID), and a time-to-live (TTL) value of 30 days. The `FeedbackInfo` object generates a feedback URL based on the feedback type, metadata, and injection type.

The `buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction` method uses the `StringCenter` object to prepare the prompt and confirmation messages with the user's screen name. It then constructs the `FeedbackMetadata` and `FeedbackInfo` objects and creates a `ChildFeedbackAction` object with the relevant information.

This method can be used in the larger project to allow users to provide feedback on the tweets they see in their timeline. By using the `buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction` method, users can indicate that they want to see fewer tweets from a particular user, which can help improve the relevance of their timeline. This method can be called from other parts of the project that deal with user feedback, such as a feedback form or a settings page. For example, a settings page might include a button that says "See fewer tweets from this user" that calls the `buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction` method with the appropriate parameters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code provides a utility function called `buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction` that takes in various parameters and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction`. It is likely used to build feedback actions for users to see fewer of a certain type of content.

2. What external dependencies does this code have? 
- This code imports various packages from external libraries such as `com.twitter.conversions.DurationOps`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core`, `com.twitter.stringcenter.client`, `com.twitter.timelines.common`, `com.twitter.timelines.service`, `com.twitter.timelineservice.model`, and `com.twitter.timelineservice.suggests`.

3. What is the significance of the `FeedbackTtl` value? 
- The `FeedbackTtl` value is a constant set to `30.days` and is used to set the time-to-live for the feedback metadata. This means that the feedback action will expire and no longer be valid after 30 days.
