The `PreviouslyServedTweetsFilter` code is a Scala object that defines a filter for a pipeline query in the Twitter product mixer component library. The purpose of this filter is to remove any previously served tweets from the candidate list before returning the final result. 

The filter takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects. The `PipelineQuery` object contains features that are used to determine whether the filter should be applied. Specifically, the filter is only applied if the `GetOlderFeature` is present in the query features. 

The `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects represent tweet candidates that are being considered for inclusion in the final result. The filter removes any candidates that have already been served to the user. This is determined by checking whether the tweet ID and source ID of each candidate are present in the `ServedTweetIdsFeature` set of the query features. 

The filter returns a `FilterResult[TweetCandidate]` object that contains two lists of tweet candidates: `kept` and `removed`. The `kept` list contains the tweet candidates that were not previously served and should be included in the final result. The `removed` list contains the tweet candidates that were previously served and should be excluded from the final result. 

This filter is likely used in the larger Twitter product mixer component library to improve the relevance of tweets shown to users. By removing previously served tweets, the library can ensure that users are not shown the same tweets multiple times. This can improve the user experience and increase engagement with the platform. 

Example usage of this filter might look like:

```
val query = PipelineQuery(Seq(GetOlderFeature, ServedTweetIdsFeature(Set(1234, 5678))))
val candidates = Seq(
  CandidateWithFeatures(TweetCandidate("tweet1"), Map.empty),
  CandidateWithFeatures(TweetCandidate("tweet2"), Map.empty),
  CandidateWithFeatures(TweetCandidate("tweet3"), Map.empty)
)

val result = PreviouslyServedTweetsFilter(query, candidates).get
println(result.kept) // List(TweetCandidate("tweet1"), TweetCandidate("tweet3"))
println(result.removed) // List(TweetCandidate("tweet2"))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a filter component for a pipeline that processes tweet candidates and removes previously served tweets.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects, and outputs a `Stitch[FilterResult[TweetCandidate]]` object.

3. What is the significance of the `GetOlderFeature` and `ServedTweetIdsFeature` features?
- The `GetOlderFeature` feature is used to determine if the query is requesting older tweets. The `ServedTweetIdsFeature` feature is used to retrieve the set of previously served tweet IDs.
