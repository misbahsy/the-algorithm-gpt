The ForYouParamConfig class is a configuration file that sets the parameters for the For You product in the Twitter home mixer. This class extends the ProductParamConfig class and is annotated with @Singleton, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application.

The class contains several override values that set the default values for various parameters used in the For You product. These parameters include booleanDeciderOverrides, booleanFSOverrides, boundedIntFSOverrides, boundedDurationFSOverrides, and enumFSOverrides. Each of these values is a sequence of parameters that are overridden from their default values.

For example, the booleanDeciderOverrides sequence includes the EnableScoredTweetsCandidatePipelineParam parameter, which is set to true. This means that the For You product will include scored tweets in its candidate pipeline.

Similarly, the boundedIntFSOverrides sequence includes the ServerMaxResultsParam parameter, which is set to a default value. This parameter sets the maximum number of results that can be returned by the server.

Overall, the ForYouParamConfig class is an important part of the For You product in the Twitter home mixer. It sets the default values for various parameters used in the product, ensuring that it functions as intended. Developers can use this class to customize the For You product by changing the default values of these parameters. For example, they can change the maximum number of results returned by the server or enable/disable certain candidate pipelines.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration class for product parameters in the For You section of Twitter, including decider keys and overrides for boolean, bounded integer, bounded duration, and enum parameters.
2. What other classes or files does this code interact with?
   - This code imports several classes from other packages, including `DeciderKey` and `DeciderKeyName` from `com.twitter.home_mixer.param.decider`, and `ProductParamConfig` from `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.product`. It also references several parameters defined in `ForYouParam`.
3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation indicates that this class can be injected with dependencies by a dependency injection framework.
