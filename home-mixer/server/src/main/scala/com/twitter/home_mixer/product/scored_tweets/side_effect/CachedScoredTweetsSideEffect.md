The `CachedScoredTweetsSideEffect` class is a side effect that caches scored tweets for a user. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this code is to cache scored tweets for a user so that they can be retrieved quickly in the future. The class takes in a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, which represent scored tweets, and builds a `CachedScoredTweets` object that contains information about each tweet. This object is then cached using a `TtlCache` object. 

The `apply` method is the main method of the class and is called when the side effect is applied to a pipeline result. It takes in a `PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs` object that contains information about the pipeline query and the scored tweets. It filters out any tweets with a score of 0 and sorts the remaining tweets by score. If there are more than 1000 tweets, it truncates the list to the top 1000. It then builds a `CachedScoredTweets` object using the `buildCachedScoredTweets` method and caches it using the `scoredTweetsCache` object. 

The `buildCachedScoredTweets` method takes in a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects and builds a `CachedScoredTweets` object that contains information about each tweet. It extracts information such as the tweet ID, score, timestamp, user ID, and other features from each `CandidateWithDetails` object and adds it to the `CachedScoredTweets` object. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project as it allows scored tweets to be cached and retrieved quickly in the future. This can improve the performance of the system and provide a better user experience. 

Example usage:

```scala
val scoredTweets = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)
val cachedScoredTweetsSideEffect = new CachedScoredTweetsSideEffect(scoredTweetsCache)
val inputs = PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs(query, scoredTweets, remainingCandidates)
cachedScoredTweetsSideEffect.apply(inputs)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a side effect for the CachedScoredTweets feature in the Home Mixer product from Twitter. It is responsible for caching scored tweets and storing them in a TtlCache.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method? 
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs` object containing a `PipelineQuery` and a `ScoredTweetsResponse`. It outputs a `Stitch[Unit]`.

3. What is the purpose of the `alerts` property? 
- The `alerts` property is a sequence of `HomeMixerAlertConfig` objects that define alerts to be triggered based on the success rate of the side effect. In this case, it defines a default success rate alert with a threshold of 99.4%.
