The `EarlybirdFeatureHydrator` class is responsible for hydrating a set of features for a given set of tweet candidates. Specifically, it is responsible for hydrating the `EarlybirdFeature` and `TweetUrlsFeature` features. 

The `EarlybirdFeature` feature is a feature that contains a set of earlybird features for a given tweet. Earlybird is Twitter's internal search engine that is used to search for tweets. The `TweetUrlsFeature` feature is a feature that contains a set of URLs for a given tweet. 

The `EarlybirdFeatureHydrator` class is a subclass of `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`, which is a class that is responsible for hydrating a set of features for a given set of tweet candidates. The `EarlybirdFeatureHydrator` class overrides the `apply` method of the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class to hydrate the `EarlybirdFeature` and `TweetUrlsFeature` features. 

The `apply` method of the `EarlybirdFeatureHydrator` class takes a `PipelineQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects as input. The `PipelineQuery` object contains a set of features that are used to search for tweets. The `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` object contains a tweet candidate and a set of features for that tweet candidate. 

The `apply` method of the `EarlybirdFeatureHydrator` class filters the `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects that do not have the `EarlybirdFeature` feature. It then calls the `client` object to search for tweets using the `PipelineQuery` object and the tweet candidate IDs of the filtered `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects. The `client` object returns a `KeyValueResult[Long, eb.ThriftSearchResult]` object that contains the search results. 

The `handleResponse` method of the `EarlybirdFeatureHydrator` class is then called to hydrate the `EarlybirdFeature` and `TweetUrlsFeature` features for the `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects. The `handleResponse` method takes the `PipelineQuery` object, the `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects, and the `KeyValueResult[Long, eb.ThriftSearchResult]` object as input. 

The `handleResponse` method filters the search results that are not successful and then uses the `EarlybirdResponseUtil` object to extract the `EarlybirdFeature` feature and the `TweetUrlsFeature` feature for each tweet candidate. The `EarlybirdAdapter` object is then used to adapt the `EarlybirdFeature` feature to a `DataRecord` object. Finally, a `FeatureMap` object is created for each tweet candidate that contains the `EarlybirdFeature`, `EarlybirdDataRecordFeature`, and `TweetUrlsFeature` features.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a feature hydrator for the Earlybird feature in the Twitter home mixer. It solves the problem of adding Earlybird features to Tweet candidates in the home mixer.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several Twitter libraries, including Finagle, Stitch, and Servo, as well as the Earlybird library and the ML API library.

3. What is the role of the ObservedKeyValueResultHandler trait in this code?
- The ObservedKeyValueResultHandler trait is used to handle the results of a key-value repository lookup in a way that allows for observation of the results. It is used in this code to handle the results of a lookup for Earlybird features.
