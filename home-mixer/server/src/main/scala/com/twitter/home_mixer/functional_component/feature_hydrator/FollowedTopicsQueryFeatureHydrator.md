The `FollowedTopicsQueryFeatureHydrator` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for hydrating the `UserFollowedTopicsCountFeature` feature for a given user. The `hydrate` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object as input and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object. The `PipelineQuery` object contains information about the user for whom the feature is being hydrated. The `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object contains the hydrated feature value.

The `FollowedTopicsQueryFeatureHydrator` class uses the `FollowedTopicsCandidateSource` object to get the list of topics that the user is following. It then uses this list to calculate the number of topics the user is following and returns it as the value of the `UserFollowedTopicsCountFeature` feature. If there is an error while fetching the list of topics, the feature value is set to `None`.

This class is a singleton and is injected with the `FollowedTopicsCandidateSource` object. It also has an `identifier` field that identifies the feature hydrator as `FollowedTopics`. The `features` field contains the set of features that this class can hydrate, which in this case is only the `UserFollowedTopicsCountFeature`. The `alerts` field contains a sequence of alert configurations that are used to monitor the performance of this feature hydrator.

This class can be used in the larger project to provide the `UserFollowedTopicsCountFeature` feature value for a given user. This feature value can be used by other components of the project to personalize the user's experience. For example, it can be used to recommend tweets or topics that the user might be interested in based on the topics they are following. 

Example usage:
```
val query = PipelineQuery(userId = 123)
val featureHydrator = FollowedTopicsQueryFeatureHydrator(followedTopicsCandidateSource)
val featureMap: FeatureMap = featureHydrator.hydrate(query).get
val userFollowedTopicsCount: Option[Int] = featureMap.get(UserFollowedTopicsCountFeature)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a query feature hydrator for a pipeline that retrieves the count of topics a user is following on Twitter. It solves the problem of providing personalized content to users based on their interests.

2. What dependencies does this code rely on? 
- This code relies on several dependencies, including `com.twitter.conversions.DurationOps`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures.UserFollowedTopicsCountFeature`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.candidate_source.topics.FollowedTopicsCandidateSource`, and `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`.

3. What alerts are set up for this code and why? 
- Two alerts are set up for this code: a default success rate alert and a default latency alert. These alerts are set up to monitor the performance of the code and ensure that it is meeting the expected standards for success rate and latency during business hours.
