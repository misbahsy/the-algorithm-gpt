The `IsListMemberFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that determines whether a user is a member of a given list. It is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The class extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class, which is a functional component that hydrates a set of candidates with a set of features. The `IsListMemberFeatureHydrator` class takes in a `PipelineQuery` object that has a `listId` property and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects that contain `UserCandidate` objects. The `UserCandidate` object represents a user and contains information such as their ID and username. 

The `apply` method is the main method of the class and is responsible for hydrating the candidates with the `IsListMemberFeature`. The method first extracts the user IDs from the candidates and creates an `IdsRequest` object from the `socialgraph` library. The `IdsRequest` object is used to query the social graph to determine which users are members of the list specified in the `PipelineQuery` object. 

Once the list of members is obtained, the method creates a `FeatureMap` object for each candidate. The `FeatureMap` object contains the `IsListMemberFeature` and a boolean value indicating whether the candidate is a member of the list. The `FeatureMap` objects are returned as a sequence and are used to hydrate the candidates with the `IsListMemberFeature`. 

This class is used in the larger project to provide a feature that can be used to filter users based on whether they are members of a given list. For example, the feature can be used to recommend users to follow based on whether they are members of a list of popular users. 

Example usage:

```
val hydrator = new IsListMemberFeatureHydrator(socialGraph)
val query = new PipelineQuery with HasListId {
  override val listId: Long = 12345
}
val candidates = Seq(
  new CandidateWithFeatures(new UserCandidate(1, "user1"), Set.empty),
  new CandidateWithFeatures(new UserCandidate(2, "user2"), Set.empty),
  new CandidateWithFeatures(new UserCandidate(3, "user3"), Set.empty)
)
val featureMaps = hydrator.apply(query, candidates).get()
featureMaps.foreach { featureMap =>
  val isListMember = featureMap.get(IsListMemberFeature).asInstanceOf[Boolean]
  println(s"Is list member: $isListMember")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a feature hydrator for a Twitter product called List Recommended Users, which checks if a user is a member of a particular list.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other Twitter libraries, including `com.twitter.home_mixer`, `com.twitter.product_mixer`, `com.twitter.socialgraph`, and `com.twitter.stitch`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` object with a `listId` property and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects containing `UserCandidate` objects. It returns a `Stitch` object containing a sequence of `FeatureMap` objects, which map features to boolean values indicating whether each candidate is a member of the specified list.
