The code defines a gate called "ExcludeSoftUserGate" that can be used to turn off certain functionality for users who are in the gradual onboarding state, also known as "Soft Users". This gate is implemented as an object that extends the "Gate" trait from the "com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.gate" package. 

The "Gate" trait defines two methods that must be implemented by any gate: "identifier" and "shouldContinue". The "identifier" method returns a unique identifier for the gate, while the "shouldContinue" method takes a "PipelineQuery" object as input and returns a "Stitch[Boolean]" object. The "PipelineQuery" object contains information about the user and the request being made, while the "Stitch" object is a monadic type that represents a computation that can fail or succeed.

The "shouldContinue" method in the "ExcludeSoftUserGate" gate checks if the "UserTypeFeature" is set to "Soft" for any of the user features in the "PipelineQuery" object. If it is, then the method returns "false" to indicate that the gate should not continue and the functionality should be turned off for the user. Otherwise, the method returns "true" to indicate that the gate should continue and the functionality should be turned on for the user.

This gate can be used in the larger project to selectively turn off certain functionality for Soft Users. For example, if the project has a feature that displays ads to users, this gate can be used to turn off ads for Soft Users until they have completed the onboarding process. 

Here is an example of how this gate can be used in the project:

```
val query = PipelineQuery(features = Seq(Map(UserTypeFeature -> Some(t.UserType.Soft))))
val shouldContinue = ExcludeSoftUserGate.shouldContinue(query).get
if (shouldContinue) {
  // continue with functionality for non-Soft Users
} else {
  // turn off functionality for Soft Users
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code defines a gate called `ExcludeSoftUserGate` that can be used to turn off certain functionality like ads for gradual onboarding users. It is used as a gate in a pipeline query.
2. What other gates are available in the project and how do they differ from this one?
   - The code does not provide information on other gates available in the project. A smart developer might need to look for other files or documentation to find out about other gates and their differences from this one.
3. What is the significance of the `Stitch` library used in this code?
   - The `Stitch` library is used to wrap the boolean value returned by the `shouldContinue` method in a monadic context. This allows for better composition and error handling in the pipeline query. A smart developer might want to know more about the `Stitch` library and its benefits.
