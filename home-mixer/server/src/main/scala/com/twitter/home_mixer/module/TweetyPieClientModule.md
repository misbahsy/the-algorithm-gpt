The TweetyPieClientModule is a module that provides an idempotent Thrift and Stitch client for the TweetService. It uses the Finagle library to create a client that can communicate with the TweetService. The purpose of this module is to provide a simple and reliable way to interact with the TweetService.

The module uses the ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule and MtlsClient traits to create a client that can communicate with the TweetService. The label and dest properties are used to identify the client and the destination of the service respectively. The providesTweetypieStitchClient method creates a new TweetyPie client using the TweetService.MethodPerEndpoint.

The clientId method is used to create a new client ID for the client. It uses the ServiceIdentifier to get the service and environment names and combines them to create a new client ID.

The configureMethodBuilder method is used to configure the MethodBuilder used by the client. It sets the timeout per request and the total timeout to 500 milliseconds.

The sessionAcquisitionTimeout method is used to set the session acquisition timeout to 250 milliseconds.

Overall, the TweetyPieClientModule provides a simple and reliable way to interact with the TweetService using the TweetyPie client. It is designed to be idempotent, meaning that it can be retried without causing any side effects. This makes it a useful module for any project that needs to interact with the TweetService. 

Example usage:

```scala
val injector = Injector()
val tweetService = injector.instance[TweetService.MethodPerEndpoint]
val tweetyPieClient = new TweetyPie(tweetService)
val tweet = tweetyPieClient.getTweet(1234)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a client that interacts with a service called TweetyPie, using both Thrift and Stitch protocols. It provides a client ID and sets timeout values for requests.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several libraries, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Stitch. It also uses the TweetService API.

3. What is the significance of the MtlsClient trait being mixed in?
- The MtlsClient trait indicates that this client uses mutual TLS authentication. This means that both the client and server must present valid certificates to each other before communication can occur.
