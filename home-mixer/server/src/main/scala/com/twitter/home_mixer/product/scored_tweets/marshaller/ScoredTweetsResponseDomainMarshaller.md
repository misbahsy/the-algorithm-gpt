The `ScoredTweetsResponseDomainMarshaller` object is responsible for creating a domain model of the Scored Tweets product response from a set of selected candidates. This object is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `ScoredTweetsResponseDomainMarshaller` object imports several classes from other packages, including `TweetCandidate`, `FeatureMap`, and `DomainMarshallerIdentifier`. It also defines several case classes, including `ScoredTweet`, `ScoredTweetsQuery`, and `ScoredTweetsResponse`. 

The `ScoredTweetsResponseDomainMarshaller` object has a single method called `apply`, which takes a `ScoredTweetsQuery` object and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects as input and returns a `ScoredTweetsResponse` object. The `apply` method first extracts the scored tweets from the selected candidates by filtering out the `TweetCandidate` objects and mapping the `ModuleCandidateWithDetails` objects to their respective `TweetCandidate` objects. It then applies the `mkScoredTweet` method to each scored tweet to create a `ScoredTweet` object. Finally, it returns a `ScoredTweetsResponse` object containing the list of scored tweets.

The `mkScoredTweet` method takes a tweet ID and a `FeatureMap` object as input and returns a `ScoredTweet` object. The method extracts various features from the `FeatureMap` object and uses them to populate the fields of the `ScoredTweet` object. Some of the features include the author ID, score, suggest type, source tweet ID, quoted tweet ID, in-reply-to tweet ID, directed-at user ID, and topic functionality type. 

Overall, the `ScoredTweetsResponseDomainMarshaller` object is an important component of the Scored Tweets product response in The Algorithm from Twitter project. It takes a set of selected candidates and creates a domain model of the scored tweets, which can be used for further processing and analysis. 

Example usage:

```
val query = ScoredTweetsQuery(...)
val selections = Seq(...)
val response = ScoredTweetsResponseDomainMarshaller(query, selections)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code creates a domain model of the Scored Tweets product response from the set of candidates selected.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `ScoredTweetsQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and outputs a `ScoredTweetsResponse`.

3. What is the purpose of the `mkScoredTweet` method?
- The `mkScoredTweet` method creates a `ScoredTweet` object from a tweet ID and a `FeatureMap` object, which contains various features of the tweet.
