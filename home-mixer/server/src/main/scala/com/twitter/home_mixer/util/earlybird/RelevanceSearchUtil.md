The `RelevanceSearchUtil` object in the `earlybird` package contains three values that are used in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. These values are `FacetsToFetch`, `MetadataOptions`, and `RelevanceOptions`. 

`FacetsToFetch` is a sequence of two strings, `Mentions` and `Hashtags`, which are constants representing the names of two facets that can be fetched from a search result. These facets are used to group search results by mentions and hashtags.

`MetadataOptions` is an instance of `ThriftSearchResultMetadataOptions`, which is a case class that specifies the metadata options to be returned in a search result. This includes options such as whether to return tweet URLs, the location of the result, the Lucene score, and more. 

`RelevanceOptions` is an instance of `ThriftSearchRelevanceOptions`, which is a case class that specifies the relevance options to be used in a search query. This includes options such as proximity scoring, the maximum number of consecutive same users, the ranking parameters, and more. 

These values are used in other parts of the project to perform searches and rank search results. For example, `MetadataOptions` is used in the `SearchService` to specify the metadata options to be returned in a search result. 

```scala
val searchResult: SearchResult = searchService.search(query, RelevanceOptions, MetadataOptions)
```

Overall, the `RelevanceSearchUtil` object provides a convenient way to specify the relevance and metadata options for search queries in The Algorithm from Twitter project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines an object called `RelevanceSearchUtil` that contains constants and parameters used for relevance search in Twitter's Earlybird search system.

2. What is the significance of the `RankingParams` and `RelevanceOptions` values?
- `RankingParams` contains a set of parameters used for ranking search results, including weights for various features such as retweet count and URL presence. `RelevanceOptions` contains additional options for relevance search, such as proximity scoring and maximum number of hits to process.

3. What other packages or dependencies are required for this code to work?
- This code requires the `com.twitter.search.common.schema.earlybird` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird` packages, as well as the `com.twitter.search.common.ranking` package. It is unclear whether any additional dependencies are required.
