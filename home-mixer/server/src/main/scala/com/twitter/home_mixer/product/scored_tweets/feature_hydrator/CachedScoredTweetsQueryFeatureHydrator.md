The `CachedScoredTweetsQueryFeatureHydrator` class is a query feature hydrator that fetches scored tweets from a cache and excludes the ones that have already been seen. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and analyzing tweets.

The class takes in a `scoredTweetsCache` object, which is a `TtlCache` that stores scored tweets for a given user ID. The `hydrate` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` object, which likely contains information about the user and the query being made. The method first retrieves the user ID from the query and the time-to-live (TTL) for the cached tweets from the query parameters. It then calls the `get` method on the `scoredTweetsCache` object to retrieve the cached tweets for the given user ID.

If the cache contains cached tweets for the user ID, the method filters out any tweets that have expired based on the TTL and constructs a `FeatureMap` object that maps the `CachedScoredTweetsFeature` to the non-expired tweets. If the cache does not contain cached tweets for the user ID, the method constructs a `FeatureMap` object that maps the `CachedScoredTweetsFeature` to an empty sequence.

The purpose of this class is likely to improve the efficiency of processing and analyzing tweets by caching scored tweets for a given user ID and excluding tweets that have already been seen. This can help reduce the amount of duplicate work that needs to be done and improve the overall performance of the system. 

Example usage:

```scala
val cache = new TtlCache[UserId, hmt.CachedScoredTweets](cacheSize, cacheTtl)
val hydrator = CachedScoredTweetsQueryFeatureHydrator(cache)

val query = PipelineQuery(userId, params)
val featureMap = hydrator.hydrate(query).get()
val cachedScoredTweets = featureMap.get(CachedScoredTweetsFeature).asInstanceOf[Seq[hmt.ScoredTweets]]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a feature hydrator that fetches scored tweets from a cache and excludes the ones that have already been seen by the user.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several packages and libraries, including `com.twitter.home_mixer`, `com.twitter.product_mixer`, `com.twitter.servo`, `com.twitter.stitch`, and `com.twitter.util`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `hydrate` method?
- The `hydrate` method takes a `PipelineQuery` object as input and is expected to return a `Stitch[FeatureMap]` object. The `FeatureMap` contains a set of features and their corresponding values, and in this case, it includes the `CachedScoredTweetsFeature` and a list of non-expired scored tweets.
