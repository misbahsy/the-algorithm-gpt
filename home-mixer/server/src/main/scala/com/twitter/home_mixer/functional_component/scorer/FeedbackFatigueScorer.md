The `FeedbackFatigueScorer` object is a Scala implementation of a scorer for Twitter's home feed algorithm. The purpose of this scorer is to adjust the score of a tweet candidate based on the feedback history of the user. The feedback history is a record of the user's interactions with tweets in their home feed, such as likes, retweets, and "see fewer" feedback. The scorer is designed to reduce the score of tweets from authors, likers, followers, and retweeters who have received "see fewer" feedback from the user in the past 14 days. The reduction in score is proportional to the number of days since the feedback was received, up to a maximum of 140 days. The scorer also takes into account the number of users who have received "see fewer" feedback from the user, and adjusts the score accordingly.

The scorer is implemented as a Scala object that extends the `Scorer` trait from the `product_mixer` library. The `Scorer` trait defines a method `apply` that takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects, and returns a `Stitch` of `FeatureMap` objects. The `PipelineQuery` contains information about the user's home feed, such as the user's ID and the time of the query. The `CandidateWithFeatures` objects contain information about the tweet candidates, such as the tweet ID, the author ID, and the features of the tweet. The `FeatureMap` objects contain the scores of the tweet candidates, as well as other features that may be used by other components of the home feed algorithm.

The `FeedbackFatigueScorer` object defines several constants that are used in the scoring algorithm, such as the duration for filtering and discounting feedback, the lower and upper bounds of the score multiplier, and the number of increments in the score multiplier. The object also defines a method `getUserDiscounts` that takes a time and a sequence of `FeedbackEntry` objects, and returns a map of user IDs to score multipliers. The `getUserDiscounts` method is used to calculate the score multipliers for authors, likers, followers, and retweeters based on their feedback history.

The `FeedbackFatigueScorer` object overrides the `identifier`, `features`, and `onlyIf` methods of the `Scorer` trait. The `identifier` method returns a unique identifier for the scorer, which is used by other components of the home feed algorithm to identify the scorer. The `features` method returns a set of features that are used by the scorer, which in this case is just the `ScoreFeature`. The `onlyIf` method returns a boolean value that indicates whether the scorer should be applied to the tweet candidates, based on the features of the `PipelineQuery`.

The `FeedbackFatigueScorer` object also overrides the `apply` method of the `Scorer` trait. The `apply` method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures` objects, and returns a `Stitch` of `FeatureMap` objects. The `apply` method first filters the feedback history of the user to include only the feedback received in the past 14 days, and groups the feedback by engagement type (tweet, like, follow, or retweet). The `apply` method then calculates the score multipliers for authors, likers, followers, and retweeters based on their feedback history, and applies the score multipliers to the tweet candidates. The `apply` method returns a `Stitch` of `FeatureMap` objects that contain the adjusted scores of the tweet candidates.

Example usage:

```scala
val query = PipelineQuery(
  userId = 123456,
  queryTime = Time.now,
  features = Some(FeatureMap(Map(FeedbackHistoryFeature -> Seq(
    FeedbackEntry(1, 2, FeedbackEntity.UserId(789), Time.now - 7.days, FeedbackType.SeeFewer),
    FeedbackEntry(3, 4, FeedbackEntity.UserId(101112), Time.now - 21.days, FeedbackType.SeeFewer)
  ))))
)

val candidates = Seq(
  CandidateWithFeatures(
    candidate = TweetCandidate(1),
    features = FeatureMap(Map(
      AuthorIdFeature -> Some(456),
      SGSValidLikedByUserIdsFeature -> Seq(789, 101112),
      SGSValidFollowedByUserIdsFeature -> Seq(131415),
      IsRetweetFeature -> false,
      ScoreFeature -> Some(0.5)
    ))
  ),
  CandidateWithFeatures(
    candidate = TweetCandidate(2),
    features = FeatureMap(Map(
      AuthorIdFeature -> Some(789),
      SGSValidLikedByUserIdsFeature -> Seq(123456),
      SGSValidFollowedByUserIdsFeature -> Seq(131415),
      IsRetweetFeature -> true,
      ScoreFeature -> Some(0.8)
    ))
  )
)

val scorer = FeedbackFatigueScorer
val result: Seq[FeatureMap] = scorer(query, candidates).get
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a scorer component for a product mixer pipeline that calculates a score multiplier based on feedback history to adjust the score of tweet candidates.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Twitter's product mixer and stitch, as well as Apache Thrift.

3. What is the logic behind the score multiplier calculation?
- The score multiplier is calculated based on the engagement type of feedback history, the time since feedback, and the user IDs associated with the tweet candidate. The multiplier is a combination of the original author's multiplier, liker multiplier, follower multiplier, and retweeter multiplier. The multiplier is calculated using a lower and upper bound, increments count, and duration in days.
