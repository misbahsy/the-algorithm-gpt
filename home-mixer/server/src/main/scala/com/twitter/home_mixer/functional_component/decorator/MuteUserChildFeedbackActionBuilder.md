[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/home-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/home_mixer/functional_component/decorator/MuteUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder.scala)

The code defines a class called `MuteUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder` that is responsible for building a child feedback action for muting a user. The class takes in a `FeatureMap` object that contains various features of a tweet, such as the author ID, screen names, and whether it is a retweet. It returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction` object that represents the action of muting a user.

The `MuteUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It is also injected with a `StringCenter` object and a `HomeMixerExternalStrings` object.

The `apply` method of the class takes in a `candidateFeatures` object and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction`. It first extracts the user ID of the tweet author or retweeter from the `candidateFeatures` object. If the tweet is a retweet, it gets the source user ID, otherwise it gets the author ID. It then extracts the screen names of the users from the `candidateFeatures` object and gets the screen name of the user with the extracted user ID. It uses the `StringCenter` object to prepare a prompt for muting the user, using the `muteUserString` value from the `HomeMixerExternalStrings` object and the extracted screen name. Finally, it creates a `ChildFeedbackAction` object with the prompt, an icon, and a `RichFeedbackBehaviorToggleMuteUser` object that represents the action of muting the user.

This class is likely used in a larger project that involves muting users on Twitter. It is used to build a child feedback action that is displayed to the user when they choose to mute a user. The `FeatureMap` object is likely populated with tweet features by other parts of the project, and this class is responsible for extracting the necessary information and building the feedback action. An example usage of this class would be:

```
val featureMap = FeatureMap(Map(
  IsRetweetFeature -> false,
  AuthorIdFeature -> 12345,
  ScreenNamesFeature -> Map(12345 -> "example_user")
))
val builder = MuteUserChildFeedbackActionBuilder(stringCenter, externalStrings)
val actionOpt = builder(featureMap)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a Scala case class that builds a mute user child feedback action for a Twitter home mixer product. It solves the problem of allowing users to mute other users in their Twitter feed.

2. What dependencies does this code have? 
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and modules, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.product.following.model`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.product.guice.scope`, `com.twitter.stringcenter.client`, `javax.inject.Inject`, and `javax.inject.Singleton`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method? 
- The `apply` method takes a `candidateFeatures` parameter of type `FeatureMap` and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction`. The `FeatureMap` is used to extract user information such as user ID, screen name, and whether a tweet is a retweet. The `ChildFeedbackAction` is a case class that represents a user feedback action, such as muting a user, and contains various properties such as a prompt, confirmation, and icon.
