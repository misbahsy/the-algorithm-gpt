The `SocialGraphServiceFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that retrieves the in-network feature for a given set of tweet candidates. The in-network feature is a boolean value that indicates whether the author of a tweet is in the viewer's social network. This feature is used to personalize the content displayed to the viewer by prioritizing tweets from users in their social network.

The class extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class, which is a generic feature hydrator that takes a pipeline query and a sequence of candidates and returns a sequence of feature maps. The `SocialGraphServiceFeatureHydrator` class overrides the `apply` method of the parent class to implement the in-network feature logic.

The `apply` method takes a pipeline query and a sequence of tweet candidates as input and returns a `Stitch` monad that contains a sequence of feature maps. The `Stitch` monad is a Twitter library for composing asynchronous operations. The method first extracts the viewer's user ID from the pipeline query. It then extracts the author IDs of the tweet candidates and filters out the viewer's own ID. The method then creates an `IdsRequest` object that specifies the viewer's ID, the relationship type (following), and the target IDs (distinct non-self author IDs). The method calls the `ids` method of the `SocialGraphStitchClient` object to retrieve the IDs of the users in the viewer's social network. The method then maps over the author IDs and checks whether each author is in the viewer's social network. If the author is the viewer, the tweet is considered in-network. If the author is not in the viewer's social network, the tweet is considered out-of-network. If the author ID is 0, the tweet is considered in-network by default. The method returns a sequence of feature maps that contain the in-network feature for each tweet candidate.

The `SocialGraphServiceFeatureHydrator` class is used in the larger project to personalize the content displayed to the viewer by prioritizing tweets from users in their social network. The class is injected into the pipeline as a feature hydrator and is called during the feature hydration stage of the pipeline. The class is also used in conjunction with other feature hydrators to compute other features for the tweet candidates. For example, the `AuthorIdFeature` feature hydrator is used to extract the author ID of each tweet candidate. The `InNetworkFeature` feature is then computed using the author IDs and the viewer's social network. The resulting feature maps are then used to rank and filter the tweet candidates before they are displayed to the viewer. 

Example usage:

```scala
val socialGraphServiceFeatureHydrator = new SocialGraphServiceFeatureHydrator(socialGraphStitchClient)
val pipelineQuery = PipelineQuery(userId = viewerId)
val tweetCandidates = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)
val featureMaps = socialGraphServiceFeatureHydrator(pipelineQuery, tweetCandidates).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a feature hydrator for a social graph service that determines whether a tweet is in-network or not.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including `TweetCandidate`, `Feature`, `FeatureMap`, `FeatureMapBuilder`, `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator`, `CandidateWithFeatures`, `FeatureHydratorIdentifier`, `PipelineQuery`, `SocialGraphStitchClient`, `Stitch`, `sg.RelationshipType`, `sg.SrcRelationship`, `sg.IdsRequest`, and `sg.PageRequest`.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a sequence of `FeatureMap` objects, each containing an `InNetworkFeature` and a boolean value indicating whether the tweet's author is in the viewer's social network or not.
