This code defines a class called `ScribeServedCommonFeaturesAndCandidateFeaturesSideEffect` that is used to send common and candidate features to a prediction service and log them in PLDR format. The class is a singleton and implements the `PipelineResultSideEffect` interface. It takes in several dependencies, including flags, event publishers, and a stats receiver. 

The `apply` method of the class takes in a `ScoredTweetsQuery` and `ScoredTweetsResponse` as inputs and returns a `Stitch[Unit]`. The method first retrieves the current timestamp and creates a `NonMLCommonFeatures` object with the user ID, prediction request ID, and timestamp. It then creates a data record from this object and scribes it to the common features event publisher. 

Next, for each selected candidate, the method retrieves the candidate features data record and extracts additional features such as predicted scores, prediction request ID, user ID, and tweet ID. It then merges these features with the original data record and converts the merged data record to PLDR format. The PLDR is then scribed to the candidate features event publisher. 

Finally, the method extracts the minimum features from the candidate features PLDR and scribes them to the minimum features event publisher. 

Overall, this class is used to log common and candidate features in PLDR format for use in downstream jobs. It takes in several dependencies and implements the `PipelineResultSideEffect` interface to apply the side effect to the input data. 

Example usage:

```scala
val sideEffect = new ScribeServedCommonFeaturesAndCandidateFeaturesSideEffect(...)
val inputs = PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs(query, response)
sideEffect.apply(inputs)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a side effect for a scored tweets product that sends common and candidate features to a prediction service and logs them in PLDR format using Scribe. It is part of the home mixer product from Twitter.

2. What external dependencies does this code have and how are they used?
- This code has dependencies on various Twitter and Finagle libraries, as well as a MySQL client for fetching metadata. These dependencies are used for features extraction, data record conversion, and event publishing.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code, and how is it used in the larger system?
- The expected input of this code is a scored tweets query and response, and the output is a side effect that logs common and candidate features in PLDR format using Scribe. This side effect is used in the larger system to provide data for downstream jobs and to join labels from client events.
