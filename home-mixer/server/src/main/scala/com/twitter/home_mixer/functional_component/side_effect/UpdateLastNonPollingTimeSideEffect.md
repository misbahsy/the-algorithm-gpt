The `UpdateLastNonPollingTimeSideEffect` class is a side effect that updates the User Session Store with the timestamps of non-polling requests. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the last non-polling request time for a user and store it in the User Session Store. This information is used to optimize the user's experience by reducing the number of polling requests made to the server.

The class takes in a `Query` object that contains information about the current request, including the `DeviceContext`, `HomeFeatures`, and `Product`. If the request is non-polling and not a background fetch request, the class updates the list of non-polling timestamps with the timestamp of the current request. The maximum number of non-polling timestamps that can be stored is 10.

The `makeLastNonPollingTimestamps` method is responsible for creating the `NonPollingTimestamps` object that will be stored in the User Session Store. This method retrieves the prior non-polling timestamps from the `HomeFeatures` object and adds the timestamp of the current request to the list. It also sets the most recent home latest non-polling timestamp for the user based on the product type.

The `UpdateLastNonPollingTimeSideEffect` class extends the `UserSessionStoreUpdateSideEffect` class, which is responsible for updating the User Session Store with the write request. The `alerts` field contains a list of alerts that will be triggered if the update is successful.

This class is used in the larger project to optimize the user's experience by reducing the number of polling requests made to the server. By keeping track of the last non-polling request time for a user, the server can determine when to send new data to the user's device without the need for polling requests. This reduces the load on the server and improves the user's experience by reducing the amount of data usage and battery drain on their device. 

Example usage:

```
val updateLastNonPollingTimeSideEffect = new UpdateLastNonPollingTimeSideEffect(query.userSessionStore)
val writeRequest = updateLastNonPollingTimeSideEffect.buildWriteRequest(query)
if (writeRequest.isDefined) {
  updateLastNonPollingTimeSideEffect.updateUserSessionStore(writeRequest.get)
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a side effect that updates the User Session Store with the timestamps of non-polling requests. It is part of the functional component of the Home Mixer service from Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they used? 
- This code has dependencies on various Twitter libraries and services, including the Home Mixer and Product Mixer components, the User Session Store, and the Finagle Request Context. These dependencies are used to access and update user session data and to perform various operations related to the Home Mixer service.

3. What is the significance of the MaxNonPollingTimes constant and how is it used? 
- The MaxNonPollingTimes constant is set to 10 and is used to limit the number of non-polling timestamps that are stored in the User Session Store. When a new non-polling timestamp is added, the oldest timestamp is removed if the number of timestamps exceeds this limit.
