The `FeatureExtractionHelper` object in the `com.twitter.home_mixer.util.tweetypie.content` package contains a single method called `extractFeatures`. This method takes in a `tp.Tweet` object and returns a `ContentFeatures` object. 

The purpose of this code is to extract various features from a tweet and package them into a `ContentFeatures` object. This object contains metadata about the tweet, such as its text, media, and conversation control. 

The `extractFeatures` method first creates a new `ContentFeatures` object with empty values for all fields except for `selfThreadMetadata`, which is set to the `selfThreadMetadata` field of the input tweet. 

Next, the method calls two other methods, `TweetTextFeaturesExtractor.addTextFeaturesFromTweet` and `TweetMediaFeaturesExtractor.addMediaFeaturesFromTweet`, passing in the `ContentFeatures` object and the input tweet. These methods extract features related to the tweet's text and media, respectively, and add them to the `ContentFeatures` object. 

Finally, the method sets the `conversationControl` field of the `ContentFeatures` object to the `conversationControl` field of the input tweet, and sets the `semanticCoreAnnotations` field to the `entityAnnotations` field of the `escherbirdEntityAnnotations` field of the input tweet. 

Overall, this code is likely used as part of a larger project that involves analyzing and processing tweets. The `ContentFeatures` object that is returned by the `extractFeatures` method could be used as input to other algorithms or models that make use of this metadata. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.home_mixer.util.tweetypie.content.FeatureExtractionHelper
import com.twitter.home_mixer.model.ContentFeatures
import com.twitter.tweetypie.thriftscala.Tweet

// assume we have a tweet object called `tweet`

val contentFeatures: ContentFeatures = FeatureExtractionHelper.extractFeatures(tweet)
// `contentFeatures` now contains metadata about the tweet's text, media, and conversation control
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is used for extracting features from a tweet in order to create content features.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.ContentFeatures` and `com.twitter.tweetypie.thriftscala` libraries.

3. What specific features are being extracted from the tweet?
   - The code extracts text and media features from the tweet, as well as conversation control and semantic core annotations.
