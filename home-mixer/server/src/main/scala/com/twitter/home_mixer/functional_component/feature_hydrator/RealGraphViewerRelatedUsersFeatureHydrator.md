The code defines a feature hydrator for the Real Graph Viewer Related Users feature in the Twitter Home Mixer project. The purpose of this feature hydrator is to extract and combine real graph features related to users who are related to a given tweet candidate. 

The code imports various classes and packages from the Twitter Home Mixer project and other libraries. It defines an object `RealGraphViewerRelatedUsersDataRecordFeature` that extends `DataRecordInAFeature` and `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure`. This object defines a default value for the feature and is used to store the real graph features related to the tweet candidate. 

The code also defines a class `RealGraphViewerRelatedUsersFeatureHydrator` that extends `CandidateFeatureHydrator`. This class is responsible for extracting and combining real graph features related to users who are related to a given tweet candidate. It defines a method `apply` that takes a `PipelineQuery`, a `TweetCandidate`, and an existing `FeatureMap` as input and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]`. The `apply` method extracts the real graph features related to the tweet candidate and combines them with the existing features to create a new `FeatureMap`. 

The `getRelatedUserIds` method is used to extract the user IDs related to the tweet candidate from the existing features. These user IDs are used to retrieve the real graph features related to the users. The `RealGraphViewerAuthorFeatureHydrator` is used to combine the real graph features related to the users. The combined features are then stored in the `RealGraphViewerRelatedUsersDataRecordFeature` object. 

This feature hydrator is used in the larger Twitter Home Mixer project to extract and combine real graph features related to users who are related to a given tweet candidate. These features are used to improve the relevance of the tweet candidate in the home timeline of the user. 

Example usage:

```
val featureHydrator = new RealGraphViewerRelatedUsersFeatureHydrator()
val query = new PipelineQuery()
val candidate = new TweetCandidate()
val existingFeatures = new FeatureMap()
val result = featureHydrator.apply(query, candidate, existingFeatures).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a feature hydrator for a Twitter product mixer that retrieves related user data from a real graph. It solves the problem of needing to combine real graph data with existing features for a given tweet candidate.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer`, `com.twitter.ml.api`, `com.twitter.product_mixer`, `com.twitter.stitch`, and `com.twitter.timelines`.

3. What is the significance of the `RealGraphViewerRelatedUsersDataRecordFeature` object?
- This object is a data record feature that is used to store real graph data for a given tweet candidate. It is defined as a feature with a default value of an empty data record.
