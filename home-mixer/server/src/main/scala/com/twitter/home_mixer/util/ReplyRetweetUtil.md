The `ReplyRetweetUtil` object contains utility methods for working with tweet candidates in the context of replies and retweets. 

The `isEligibleReply` method takes a `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` object and returns a boolean indicating whether it is an eligible reply. An eligible reply is defined as a tweet candidate that has a non-empty `InReplyToTweetIdFeature` and is not a retweet (`IsRetweetFeature` is false).

The `replyToAncestorTweetCandidatesMap` method takes a sequence of tweet candidates and returns a map from reply tweet IDs to sequences of ancestor tweet candidates. An ancestor tweet candidate is defined as a tweet candidate that is either the parent tweet of the reply tweet (`InReplyToTweetIdFeature`) or a tweet in the same conversation (`ConversationModuleIdFeature`). The ancestor tweets are ordered bottom-up, with the parent tweet as the first item and the root tweet as the last item. Retweets of replies or replies to retweets are not included in the map.

The `ancestorTweetIdToDescendantRepliesMap` method takes a sequence of tweet candidates and returns a map from ancestor tweet IDs to sequences of descendant reply tweet candidates. A descendant reply tweet candidate is defined as a tweet candidate that has the ancestor tweet as its parent tweet (`InReplyToTweetIdFeature`) or is in the same conversation (`ConversationModuleIdFeature`). The map only includes the two most recent ancestors of each reply tweet. Retweets of replies are not included in the map.

The `replyTweetIdToInReplyToTweetMap` method takes a sequence of tweet candidates and returns a map from reply tweet IDs to their corresponding in-reply-to tweet candidates. An in-reply-to tweet candidate is defined as a tweet candidate that has the same ID as the `InReplyToTweetIdFeature` of the reply tweet candidate. Retweets of replies or replies to retweets are not included in the map.

These methods are likely used in the larger project to analyze and manipulate tweet candidates in the context of replies and retweets. For example, the `replyToAncestorTweetCandidatesMap` method could be used to construct a thread of tweets given a reply tweet candidate, while the `ancestorTweetIdToDescendantRepliesMap` method could be used to find all the replies to a given tweet candidate. The `replyTweetIdToInReplyToTweetMap` method could be used to find the tweet that a reply tweet is in reply to.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReplyRetweetUtil` object?
- The `ReplyRetweetUtil` object contains methods for building maps of tweet candidates based on their reply and ancestor relationships.

2. What is the input and output of the `replyToAncestorTweetCandidatesMap` method?
- The input of the `replyToAncestorTweetCandidatesMap` method is a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects. The output is a map from a reply tweet ID to a sequence of ancestor tweet candidates that are also hydrated candidates.

3. What is the difference between the `replyToAncestorTweetCandidatesMap` and `ancestorTweetIdToDescendantRepliesMap` methods?
- The `replyToAncestorTweetCandidatesMap` method builds a map from reply tweet IDs to ancestor tweet candidates, while the `ancestorTweetIdToDescendantRepliesMap` method builds a map from ancestor tweet IDs to descendant reply tweet candidates.
