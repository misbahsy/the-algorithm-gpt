The `PeopleDiscoveryServiceModule` is a module that provides a Thrift client for the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService`. This module is a copy of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.module.PeopleDiscoveryServiceModule`. 

The purpose of this module is to provide a client for the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` which is used for discovering people on Twitter. This client can be used to make requests to the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` and receive responses. 

The module extends the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` which provides a `MethodBuilder` that can be used to build a Thrift client. The `MtlsClient` trait is also extended which provides support for mutual TLS. 

The `label` field is used to identify the client and the `dest` field is used to specify the destination of the client. In this case, the destination is the `/s/people-discovery-api/people-discovery-api:thrift` endpoint. 

The `configureMethodBuilder` method is overridden to configure the `MethodBuilder`. In this case, the timeout per request and the total timeout are set to 350 milliseconds. 

The `sessionAcquisitionTimeout` method is also overridden to set the session acquisition timeout to 500 milliseconds. 

Overall, this module provides a client for the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` which can be used to discover people on Twitter. The module can be used in the larger project to make requests to the `ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService` and receive responses. 

Example usage:

```scala
val injector = Injector()
val client = injector.instance[ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService.MethodPerEndpoint]
val response = client.someMethod(request)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a Thrift client that connects to a PeopleDiscoveryService API. It sets up a MethodBuilder with specific timeouts and implements MtlsClient for mutual TLS authentication.

2. What is the significance of the label and dest variables?
- The label variable is a string used to identify the client in logs and metrics. The dest variable is the destination address of the Thrift server that the client will connect to.

3. What is the reason for setting specific timeouts in the configureMethodBuilder method?
- The timeouts are set to ensure that requests to the server do not take too long and potentially cause performance issues or block other requests. The timeoutPerRequest limits the time for each individual request, while the timeoutTotal limits the total time for all requests in a session.
