The `YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder` class is a decorator that adds a fixed 'You Might Like' string above all OON (Out of Network) Tweets. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The class takes in a `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` as input parameters. The `PipelineQuery` is a query that is used to retrieve a set of `TweetCandidate` objects. The `TweetCandidate` is a candidate tweet that is being considered for display. The `FeatureMap` is a map of features that are associated with the `TweetCandidate`. 

The `apply` method is the main method of the class. It takes in the input parameters and returns an optional `SocialContext` object. If the `TweetCandidate` is not in the network and is not a retweet, the method returns a `SocialContext` object that contains the 'You Might Like' string. Otherwise, it returns `None`. 

The `SocialContext` object is a metadata object that is used to provide additional context to the `TweetCandidate`. It contains information such as the context type, text, URL, context image URLs, and landing URL. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:

```scala
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidate = TweetCandidate(...)
val features = FeatureMap(...)
val socialContextBuilder = YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder(...)
val socialContext = socialContextBuilder(query, candidate, features)
```

In this example, we create a `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` object. We then create an instance of the `YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder` class and pass in the `HomeMixerExternalStrings` and `StringCenter` objects. Finally, we call the `apply` method of the `YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder` class and pass in the `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` objects. The method returns an optional `SocialContext` object that can be used to provide additional context to the `TweetCandidate`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a Scala class that renders a fixed 'You Might Like' string above all OON (out-of-network) Tweets.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model`, and `com.twitter.stringcenter.client`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
    
    The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` as input and returns an optional `SocialContext` object as output. The `SocialContext` object is either a `GeneralContext` object with a `SparkleGeneralContextType` and a prepared 'You Might Like' string, or `None`.
