The code defines a class called AuthorChildFeedbackActionBuilder that is used to build a ChildFeedbackAction object. This class takes in a FeatureMap object called candidateFeatures as a parameter and returns an optional ChildFeedbackAction object. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to build a ChildFeedbackAction object that can be used to provide feedback to Twitter's recommendation algorithm. The ChildFeedbackAction object is used to indicate to the algorithm that the user wants to see fewer tweets from a particular author. 

The apply method of the AuthorChildFeedbackActionBuilder class takes in the candidateFeatures FeatureMap object and uses the CandidatesUtil.getOriginalAuthorId method to get the original author ID of the tweet. It then uses the FeedbackUtil.buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction method to build the ChildFeedbackAction object. 

The buildUserSeeFewerChildFeedbackAction method takes in several parameters including the authorId, namesByUserId, promptExternalString, confirmationExternalString, engagementType, stringCenter, and injectionType. These parameters are used to build the ChildFeedbackAction object. 

The AuthorChildFeedbackActionBuilder class is used in the larger project to provide a way for users to provide feedback to the recommendation algorithm. When a user wants to see fewer tweets from a particular author, they can use the ChildFeedbackAction object built by this class to provide that feedback. This feedback is then used by the algorithm to improve its recommendations. 

Example usage:

```
val candidateFeatures: FeatureMap = ...
val builder = AuthorChildFeedbackActionBuilder(stringCenter, externalStrings)
val feedbackAction = builder(candidateFeatures)
if (feedbackAction.isDefined) {
  // send feedbackAction to recommendation algorithm
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a decorator pattern for building a child feedback action for Twitter's Home Mixer product. It solves the problem of providing users with the ability to see fewer tweets from a specific author.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.product`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core`, `com.twitter.stringcenter.client`, and `com.twitter.timelines.service.thriftscala`.

3. What is the role of the `AuthorChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class and how is it used?
- The `AuthorChildFeedbackActionBuilder` class is a singleton that takes in a `StringCenter` and `HomeMixerExternalStrings` as dependencies and provides a method `apply` that takes in a `FeatureMap` and returns an optional `ChildFeedbackAction`. It is used to build a child feedback action for a specific author based on the provided `FeatureMap`.
