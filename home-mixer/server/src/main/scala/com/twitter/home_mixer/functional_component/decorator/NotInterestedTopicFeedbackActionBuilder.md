The code defines a class called `NotInterestedTopicFeedbackActionBuilder` that is responsible for building a feedback action object based on a set of candidate features. The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application.

The `NotInterestedTopicFeedbackActionBuilder` class has a single method called `apply` that takes a `FeatureMap` object as input and returns an optional `FeedbackAction` object. The `FeatureMap` object contains a set of features that describe a candidate recommendation. The `FeedbackAction` object represents an action that a user can take to provide feedback on a recommendation.

The `apply` method first extracts several features from the `FeatureMap` object, including whether the recommendation is in-network, a list of valid followed-by user IDs, and a list of valid liked-by user IDs. If the recommendation is out-of-network and has no valid liked-by or followed-by user IDs, the method proceeds to extract the topic ID and topic functionality type from the `FeatureMap` object. If the topic functionality type is either `RecommendationTopicContextFunctionalityType` or `RecWithEducationTopicContextFunctionalityType`, the method returns a `FeedbackAction` object with a `RichFeedbackBehaviorMarkNotInterestedTopic` object that contains the topic ID. Otherwise, the method returns `None`.

This code is likely used as part of a larger recommendation system that provides users with personalized recommendations based on their interests and social connections. The `NotInterestedTopicFeedbackActionBuilder` class is responsible for generating feedback actions that allow users to provide feedback on recommendations that they are not interested in. This feedback can be used to improve the recommendation system and provide better recommendations to users in the future.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a Scala case class that builds a feedback action for a not interested topic. It is part of the functional component decorator for the Home Mixer product at Twitter.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on? 
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.product.following.model.HomeMixerExternalStrings`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method? 
- The `apply` method takes in a `FeatureMap` object and returns an optional `FeedbackAction`. The `FeatureMap` is used to extract various features related to the topic and user behavior, and the `FeedbackAction` is built based on these features. If the conditions are not met, the method returns `None`.
