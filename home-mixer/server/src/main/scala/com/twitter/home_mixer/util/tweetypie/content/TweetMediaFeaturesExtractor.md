The `TweetMediaFeaturesExtractor` object contains methods for extracting media features from a tweet. The object has two main methods: `hasImage` and `hasVideo`, which take a `tp.Tweet` object and return a boolean indicating whether the tweet contains an image or a video, respectively. These methods use the `hasMediaByCategory` method, which takes a tweet and a set of media categories and returns a boolean indicating whether the tweet contains media of any of the specified categories.

The `addMediaFeaturesFromTweet` method takes a `ContentFeatures` object and a `tp.Tweet` object and returns a new `ContentFeatures` object with media-related features added. The method extracts various features from the tweet's media entities, including size, playback information, color palette, stickers, and metadata defined by the user when uploading the media. The method also extracts information about media tags associated with the tweet. The resulting `ContentFeatures` object includes all of the input features as well as the extracted media features.

The object also contains several private methods that are used by `addMediaFeaturesFromTweet` to extract specific media features. These methods include `getSizeFeatures`, which extracts the size of the media entities, `getPlaybackFeatures`, which extracts playback information, `getFaceMapAreas`, which extracts information about faces in the media entities, `getSortedColorPalette`, which extracts the color palette of the media entities, `getStickerFeatures`, which extracts information about stickers applied to the media entities, `getMediaOriginProviders`, which extracts information about third-party media providers, `getIsManaged`, which extracts information about whether the media entities are managed, `getIs360`, which extracts information about whether the media entities are 360-degree media, `getViewCount`, which extracts the view count of the media entities, and `getUserDefinedProductMetadataFeatures`, which extracts metadata defined by the user when uploading the media.

Overall, this object provides a way to extract media-related features from a tweet, which can be used in various ways in the larger project. For example, these features could be used to train machine learning models to classify tweets based on their media content or to recommend tweets to users based on their media preferences.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines an object called `TweetMediaFeaturesExtractor` that contains methods for extracting various features from a tweet's media content, such as whether it contains an image or video, the size and aspect ratio of the media, the dominant color, and metadata defined by the user when uploading the media.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   - This code imports several classes from external libraries, including `com.twitter.mediaservices.commons`, `com.twitter.tweetypie`, and `scala.collection.Map`.

3. What data structures are used in this code?
   - This code uses several data structures, including sets (`ImageCategories` and `VideoCategories`), sequences (`mediaEntities`), maps (`tagMap`), and case classes (`MediaSizeFeatures`, `PlaybackFeatures`, and `UserDefinedProductMetadataFeatures`).
