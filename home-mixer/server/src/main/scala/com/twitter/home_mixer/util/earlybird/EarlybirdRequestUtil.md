The `EarlybirdRequestUtil` object contains a method called `getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest` that returns an `EarlybirdRequest` object. This method takes in several parameters, including `userId`, `tweetIds`, and `clientId`, which are all optional. 

The purpose of this method is to generate a search query for the Earlybird search engine, which is used by Twitter to search for tweets. The search query is constructed using the `ThriftSearchQuery` class, which is part of the Earlybird library. The `ThriftSearchQuery` object contains several parameters that are used to specify the search criteria, such as the number of results to return, the ranking mode, and the searcher ID.

The `getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest` method also sets several default values for the search query parameters, such as the maximum number of hits per shard, the search processing timeout, and the maximum number of results per shard. These default values are used if no other values are specified.

The `EarlybirdRequest` object that is returned by the `getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest` method contains the search query, as well as several other parameters that are used to specify additional search options, such as whether to search for tweets in the archive index, whether to search for protected tweets only, and whether to skip very recent tweets.

Overall, the `EarlybirdRequestUtil` object is used to generate search queries for the Earlybird search engine, which is an important component of Twitter's search functionality. The `getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest` method is a high-level method that provides a convenient way to generate search queries with default values, but it can also be customized by specifying different values for the optional parameters. 

Example usage:

```
val request = EarlybirdRequestUtil.getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest(
  userId = Some(123456),
  tweetIds = Some(Seq(987654, 876543)),
  clientId = Some("my-client-id"),
  getTweetsFromArchiveIndex = true,
  getOnlyProtectedTweets = false
)
``` 

This code generates an `EarlybirdRequest` object that searches for tweets with the specified user ID and tweet IDs, using the specified client ID. It also searches for tweets in the archive index and does not limit the search to protected tweets only.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an object called `EarlybirdRequestUtil` that contains a method called `getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest` which returns an `EarlybirdRequest` object. The purpose of this code is to provide a utility for generating an `EarlybirdRequest` object for searching tweets.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several classes from external libraries, including `com.twitter.conversions.DurationOps`, `com.twitter.search.common.query.thriftjava`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thriftscala`. It is possible that there are other dependencies that are not shown in this file.

3. What are the default values for some of the parameters used in `getTweetsEBFeaturesRequest`?
- The default values for `getTweetsFromArchiveIndex` and `getOnlyProtectedTweets` are both `false`. The default value for `DefaultMaxHitsToProcess` is `1000`, the default value for `DefaultSearchProcessingTimeout` is `200.milliseconds`, and the default value for `DefaultMaxNumResultsPerShard` is `100`.
