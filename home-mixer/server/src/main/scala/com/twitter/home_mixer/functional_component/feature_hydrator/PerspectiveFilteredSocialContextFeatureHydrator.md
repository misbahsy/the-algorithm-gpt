The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class is a Scala implementation of a feature hydrator that filters out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. This class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is located in the `com.twitter.home_mixer.functional_component.feature_hydrator` package.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to filter out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. This is useful if the likes come from a cache and because UTEG does not fully remove unlike edges. The class uses the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait to hydrate a set of features for a set of candidates. The `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait is a trait that defines a method for hydrating a set of features for a set of candidates.

The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `timelineService` object to get the perspectives of the users who have liked a tweet. The `timelineService` object is an instance of the `TimelineService` class, which is part of the `com.twitter.stitch.timelineservice` package. The `TimelineService` class is a service that provides access to the timelines of Twitter users.

The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `GetPerspectives` object to get the perspectives of the users who have liked a tweet. The `GetPerspectives` object is an object that defines a method for getting the perspectives of a user who has liked a tweet. The `GetPerspectives` object is part of the `com.twitter.stitch.timelineservice.TimelineService` package.

The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` object to filter out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. The `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` object is an object that defines a feature for filtering out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. The `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` object is part of the `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures` package.

The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `FeatureMapBuilder` object to build a feature map for each candidate. The `FeatureMapBuilder` object is an object that defines a method for building a feature map for a set of features. The `FeatureMapBuilder` object is part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap` package.

The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class is a singleton class that is injected with the `timelineService` object. The `timelineService` object is injected into the constructor of the `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class.

Example usage:

```scala
val featureHydrator = new PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator(timelineService)
val query = PipelineQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(...)
val featureMaps = featureHydrator(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a feature hydrator that filters out unlike edges from liked-by tweets.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` and returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `FeatureMap`.

3. What is the significance of the `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` feature?
- The `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` feature is the only feature used in this code and it is used to store the filtered liked-by user IDs after the perspective filtering.
