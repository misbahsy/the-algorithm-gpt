The `ClearCacheIncludeInstruction` class is a part of the Twitter home mixer project and is used to include a clear cache timeline instruction in the response when certain criteria are met. The purpose of this instruction is to ensure that there is sufficient new content to justify jumping users to the top of the new timelines response and to avoid adding unnecessary load to backend systems.

The class takes two parameters: `enableParam` and `minEntriesParam`. `enableParam` is a boolean parameter that determines whether the clear cache instruction should be included or not. `minEntriesParam` is an integer parameter that specifies the minimum number of non-ad tweet entries that should be present in the response for the clear cache instruction to be included.

The `apply` method of the class takes two parameters: `query` and `entries`. `query` is an instance of `PipelineQuery` with `HasDeviceContext` trait, which provides device context information for the query. `entries` is a sequence of `TimelineEntry` objects that represent the timeline entries in the response.

The `apply` method first checks if the `enableParam` is set to true. If it is not, the method returns false and the clear cache instruction is not included in the response. If it is set to true, the method checks if the request provenance is "pull to refresh" by checking the device context information. If it is not, the method returns false and the clear cache instruction is not included in the response.

Finally, the method checks if the number of non-ad tweet entries in the response is greater than or equal to the `minEntriesParam`. If it is, the method returns true and the clear cache instruction is included in the response. If it is not, the method returns false and the clear cache instruction is not included in the response.

Overall, the `ClearCacheIncludeInstruction` class is used to ensure that the clear cache instruction is included in the response only when there is sufficient new content to justify jumping users to the top of the new timelines response and to avoid adding unnecessary load to backend systems. This helps to improve the user experience and reduce the load on backend systems. An example of using this class in the larger project could be as follows:

```
val clearCacheInstruction = ClearCacheIncludeInstruction(enableParam = true, minEntriesParam = 10)
val query = PipelineQuery(deviceContext = Some(DeviceContext(RequestContext.PullToRefresh)))
val entries = Seq(TweetItem(...), TweetItem(...), TimelineModule(...))
val includeClearCache = clearCacheInstruction.apply(query, entries)
// includeClearCache will be true if the clear cache instruction should be included in the response
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for including a clear cache timeline instruction when certain criteria are met in a response.

2. What are the criteria that need to be met for the clear cache timeline instruction to be included?
- The request provenance must be "pull to refresh" and there must be at least N non-ad tweet entries in the response.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?
- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` with `HasDeviceContext` and a sequence of `TimelineEntry` objects, and returns a boolean indicating whether the clear cache timeline instruction should be included or not.
