The code defines a configuration class for the Following product parameters in the Twitter Home Mixer project. The purpose of this class is to provide a set of default values and overrides for the parameters that control the behavior of the Following product. 

The class extends the ProductParamConfig trait, which defines methods for accessing and setting the values of various product parameters. The class is annotated with the @Singleton annotation, which indicates that only one instance of the class will be created and shared across the application. 

The class defines several override values for different types of product parameters, including boolean, bounded integer, string, bounded duration, and enum parameters. These override values are used to customize the behavior of the Following product for different clients and use cases. 

For example, the booleanFSOverrides field contains a list of boolean parameters that can be overridden, such as EnableFlipInjectionModuleCandidatePipelineParam and EnableWhoToFollowCandidatePipelineParam. These parameters control whether certain features are enabled or disabled for the Following product. 

Similarly, the boundedIntFSOverrides field contains a list of bounded integer parameters that can be overridden, such as FlipInlineInjectionModulePosition and WhoToFollowPositionParam. These parameters control the position of certain modules within the Following product. 

Overall, this class provides a centralized way to manage and customize the parameters for the Following product in the Twitter Home Mixer project. Other classes and modules in the project can use this configuration class to access and modify the default parameter values as needed. 

Example usage:

```
val followingParamConfig = new FollowingParamConfig()
val enableFlipInjection = followingParamConfig.booleanFSOverrides.contains(EnableFlipInjectionModuleCandidatePipelineParam)
println(s"Enable Flip Injection: $enableFlipInjection")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration class for product parameters related to following on Twitter, including boolean, integer, string, and enum overrides.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code imports and relies on classes from packages such as `com.twitter.home_mixer.param.decider`, `com.twitter.home_mixer.product.following.param`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.product`, and `com.twitter.servo.decider`. It also uses annotations such as `@Singleton` and `@Inject`.
3. What is the significance of the `DeciderKey.EnableFollowingProduct` and `SupportedClientFSName` values?
   - `DeciderKey.EnableFollowingProduct` is a decider key used to enable or disable the following product, while `SupportedClientFSName` is a string representing the name of the supported client. These values are used in the configuration of product parameters.
