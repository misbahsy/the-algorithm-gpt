The `WhoToFollowEntryMarshaller` object in the `timeline_logging` package is responsible for marshalling user data into a `thriftlog.WhoToFollowEntry` object. This object is used in the larger project to log user interactions with the "Who to Follow" feature on Twitter.

The `apply` method takes in two parameters: an instance of `UserItem` and an instance of `ItemCandidateWithDetails`. The `UserItem` contains information about a specific user, such as their ID and display type, while the `ItemCandidateWithDetails` contains information about the user's candidacy for the "Who to Follow" feature, such as their score.

The method then creates a new `thriftlog.WhoToFollowEntry` object using the data from the `UserItem` and `ItemCandidateWithDetails`. The `userId` field is set to the ID of the user, the `displayType` field is set to the user's display type as a string, the `score` field is set to the user's score (if available), the `enableReactiveBlending` field is set to whether or not reactive blending is enabled for the user, the `impressionId` field is set to the user's impression string (if available), and the `advertiserId` field is set to the user's advertiser ID (if available).

This object is then returned and can be used for logging user interactions with the "Who to Follow" feature. For example, it could be sent to a logging service to track which users are being suggested to other users and how they are interacting with those suggestions.

Example usage:

```
val userItem = UserItem(id = 123, displayType = DisplayType.Suggested)
val candidate = ItemCandidateWithDetails(features = Map(ScoreFeature -> 0.8))
val entry = WhoToFollowEntryMarshaller(userItem, candidate)
logService.log(entry)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala object that defines a function called `apply` which takes in two parameters and returns a `thriftlog.WhoToFollowEntry` object. The purpose of this function is to convert a `UserItem` and an `ItemCandidateWithDetails` into a `WhoToFollowEntry` object for timeline logging.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several other packages and modules, including `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.pipeline.candidate.who_to_follow_module.ScoreFeature`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.presentation.ItemCandidateWithDetails`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.item.user.UserItem`, and `com.twitter.timelines.timeline_logging.thriftscala`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` function?
- The `apply` function takes in a `UserItem` and an `ItemCandidateWithDetails` as parameters and returns a `thriftlog.WhoToFollowEntry` object. The `UserItem` represents a user item in the timeline, while the `ItemCandidateWithDetails` represents a candidate for the "who to follow" module. The `thriftlog.WhoToFollowEntry` object contains information about the user, including their ID, display type, score, and other metadata.
