The `NamesFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that retrieves and adds screen names and real names to a set of tweet candidates. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `NamesFeatureHydrator` class extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class, which is a feature hydrator that retrieves and adds features to a set of candidates. The `NamesFeatureHydrator` class is also conditionally implemented, meaning that it will only execute if certain conditions are met. 

The `NamesFeatureHydrator` class retrieves screen names and real names from a set of tweet candidates. It does this by first retrieving a set of user IDs from the tweet candidates. It then retrieves the screen names and real names associated with each user ID using the `gizmoduck.getUserById` method. The retrieved screen names and real names are then added to the tweet candidates using the `FeatureMapBuilder` class. 

The `NamesFeatureHydrator` class is used in the larger project to add screen names and real names to tweet candidates. This information can be used to provide additional context to users when they are viewing tweets. For example, screen names and real names can be used to identify the author of a tweet or to identify users who have liked or retweeted a tweet. 

Example usage:

```scala
val namesFeatureHydrator = new NamesFeatureHydrator(gizmoduck)
val pipelineQuery = PipelineQuery(...)
val tweetCandidates = Seq(...)
val featureMaps = namesFeatureHydrator(pipelineQuery, tweetCandidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a feature hydrator for a Twitter home mixer project that retrieves user profile names and screen names.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several packages and libraries, including com.twitter.gizmoduck, com.twitter.home_mixer.model, com.twitter.product_mixer, com.twitter.stitch, and javax.inject.

3. What is the logic behind the `onlyIf` method and how does it affect the behavior of the code?
- The `onlyIf` method checks the query's product and returns a boolean value that determines whether the feature hydrator should be applied. If the product is FollowingProduct, the method checks for the EnableNahFeedbackInfoParam parameter. If it is true, the feature hydrator is applied; otherwise, it is not applied. For all other products, the feature hydrator is always applied.
