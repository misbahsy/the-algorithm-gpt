The code defines an adapter for creating a data record that includes non-ML (machine learning) features. The purpose of this adapter is to create a data record that can be used as a joined key in a batch pipeline. 

The `NonMLCommonFeatures` case class defines the non-ML features that will be included in the data record. These features include the user ID, prediction request ID (an optional field), and served timestamp. 

The `NonMLCommonFeaturesAdapter` object is the adapter that creates the data record. It extends `TimelinesMutatingAdapterBase`, which is a base class for adapters that mutate timelines data. The `getFeatureContext` method returns a `FeatureContext` object that defines the features that will be included in the data record. In this case, the features are the user ID, prediction request ID, and served timestamp. 

The `commonFeatures` field is a set of `Feature` objects that correspond to the features defined in the `FeatureContext`. 

The `setFeatures` method takes a `NonMLCommonFeatures` object and a `RichDataRecord` object as input. It sets the values of the features in the `RichDataRecord` object based on the values in the `NonMLCommonFeatures` object. Specifically, it sets the user ID feature to the `userId` field of the `NonMLCommonFeatures` object, sets the prediction request ID feature to the `predictionRequestId` field of the `NonMLCommonFeatures` object (if it is not `None`), and sets the served timestamp feature to the `servedTimestamp` field of the `NonMLCommonFeatures` object. 

Overall, this code defines an adapter for creating a data record that includes non-ML features, which can be used as a joined key in a batch pipeline. The adapter sets the values of the features in the data record based on the values in a `NonMLCommonFeatures` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a non-ML features adapter for creating a data record with non-ML features to be used as a joined key in a batch pipeline. It is part of the functional component feature hydrator for the larger project.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `setFeatures` method? 
- The `setFeatures` method takes in a `NonMLCommonFeatures` object and a `RichDataRecord` object as inputs. It sets the feature values for user ID, prediction request ID, and served timestamp in the `RichDataRecord` object.

3. What are the shared features used in this code and where are they defined? 
- The shared features used in this code are `USER_ID`, `PREDICTION_REQUEST_ID`, and `SERVED_TIMESTAMP`. They are defined in the `SharedFeatures` and `TimelinesSharedFeatures` objects from the `com.twitter.ml.api.constant` and `com.twitter.timelines.prediction.features.common` packages, respectively.
