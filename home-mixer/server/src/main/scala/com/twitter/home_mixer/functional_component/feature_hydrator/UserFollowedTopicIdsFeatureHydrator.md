The `UserFollowedTopicIdsFeatureHydrator` class is a feature hydrator that retrieves a sequence of topic IDs that a user follows and adds them as a feature to a given set of tweet candidates. This class extends the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class, which is a functional component that hydrates a set of candidates with a set of features. 

The `UserFollowedTopicIdsFeatureHydrator` class uses a `KeyValueRepository` to retrieve the topic IDs that a user follows. The `apply` method takes a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` as input and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`. The `PipelineQuery` is not used in this class, but it is passed as an argument to the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` class. The `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` is a candidate with a set of features, where each feature is a key-value pair. 

The `apply` method first extracts the author IDs from the given set of candidates using the `extractKeys` method. It then retrieves the topic IDs that each author follows using the `KeyValueRepository` and the `client` object. The retrieved topic IDs are then transformed into a `Seq[FeatureMap]` object, where each `FeatureMap` object contains a `UserFollowedTopicIdsFeature` feature and its corresponding value. The `FeatureMap` objects are returned as a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`.

The `UserFollowedTopicIdsFeature` object is a feature that represents the topic IDs that a user follows. It extends the `Feature` class, which is a core feature of the product mixer component library. 

The `UserFollowedTopicIdsFeatureHydrator` class is used in the larger project to add the topic IDs that a user follows as a feature to a given set of tweet candidates. This feature can be used in various ways, such as to personalize the content that is shown to a user based on their interests. 

Example usage:

```scala
val hydrator = new UserFollowedTopicIdsFeatureHydrator(client, statsReceiver)
val candidates = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)
val query = PipelineQuery()
val result: Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]] = hydrator(query, candidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code is a feature hydrator for the UserFollowedTopicIds feature in the Home Mixer component of the Twitter product mixer. It is responsible for retrieving data from a KeyValueRepository and transforming it into a FeatureMap to be used in the pipeline.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they being used? 
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including KeyValueRepository, ObservedKeyValueResultHandler, and FeatureMapBuilder. These dependencies are being used to extract data from the KeyValueRepository, transform it into a FeatureMap, and handle any errors that may occur.

3. What is the expected input and output of the apply() method? 
- The apply() method takes in a PipelineQuery and a sequence of CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate] objects, and returns a Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]. The expected input is a set of candidates with associated features, and the expected output is a sequence of FeatureMaps containing the UserFollowedTopicIds feature for each candidate.
