The `FeedbackHistoryQueryFeatureHydrator` class is a query feature hydrator that retrieves a user's feedback history from a `FeedbackHistoryManhattanClient` and adds it to a `FeatureMap`. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves analyzing user feedback to improve the Twitter experience.

The `FeedbackHistoryQueryFeatureHydrator` class extends the `QueryFeatureHydrator` class and implements the `Conditionally` trait. It takes in a `FeedbackHistoryManhattanClient` as a parameter and is annotated with `@Singleton`. The `identifier` field is set to "FeedbackHistory", and the `features` field is set to a `Set` containing a `FeedbackHistoryFeature`.

The `onlyIf` method checks if the `EnableFeedbackFatigueParam` parameter is set to true in the `PipelineQuery` object passed in as a parameter. If it is, the method returns true, indicating that the `hydrate` method should be called.

The `hydrate` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` object and returns a `Stitch[FeatureMap]`. It calls the `get` method on the `PipelineQuery` object to retrieve the user ID, then calls the `get` method on the `feedbackHistoryClient` object to retrieve the user's feedback history. The `Stitch.callFuture` method is used to asynchronously retrieve the feedback history. Once the feedback history is retrieved, it is added to a `FeatureMap` using the `FeatureMapBuilder` class, and the `build` method is called to create the `FeatureMap`. The `FeatureMap` is then returned as a `Stitch` object.

Overall, the `FeedbackHistoryQueryFeatureHydrator` class is responsible for retrieving a user's feedback history and adding it to a `FeatureMap`. This `FeatureMap` can then be used in the larger project to analyze user feedback and improve the Twitter experience. An example of how this class might be used is shown below:

```
val query = PipelineQuery(userId = "12345", params = Map(EnableFeedbackFatigueParam -> true))
val hydrator = FeedbackHistoryQueryFeatureHydrator(feedbackHistoryClient)
if (hydrator.onlyIf(query)) {
  val featureMap = hydrator.hydrate(query).get()
  // Use the featureMap to analyze user feedback
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a query feature hydrator for the FeedbackHistory feature in the HomeFeatures model. It hydrates the feature by calling the FeedbackHistoryManhattanClient to get feedback history for a given user ID and adds it to a FeatureMap.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures.FeedbackHistoryFeature, com.twitter.home_mixer.param.HomeGlobalParams.EnableFeedbackFatigueParam, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMapBuilder, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator.QueryFeatureHydrator, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.Conditionally, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.FeatureHydratorIdentifier, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery, com.twitter.stitch.Stitch, and com.twitter.timelinemixer.clients.feedback.FeedbackHistoryManhattanClient.

3. What is the significance of the @Singleton annotation?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of FeedbackHistoryQueryFeatureHydrator will be created and shared across the application. This can help improve performance and reduce memory usage by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
