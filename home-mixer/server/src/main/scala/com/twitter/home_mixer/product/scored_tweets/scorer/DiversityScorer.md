The `DiversityScorer` class is a Scala implementation of a scorer that discounts the scores of consecutive tweets from the same entity (e.g. author, engager, topic) based on a discount factor provided by the `DiversityDiscountProvider`. The purpose of this scorer is to increase the diversity of the tweets shown to users in their home feed by reducing the prominence of tweets from the same entity.

The `DiversityScorer` class extends the `Scorer` trait, which takes a query and a sequence of candidates and returns a sequence of feature maps. The `identifier` field is set to "Diversity", and the `features` field is set to a set containing a single `ScoreFeature`. The `apply` method takes a `ScoredTweetsQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` objects, which contain a `TweetCandidate` and its associated features. The method returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`, which is a monadic type that represents a computation that can be executed asynchronously.

The `apply` method first groups the candidates by entity ID using the `diversityDiscountProvider.entityId` function. For each entity, it sorts the candidates by score in descending order and applies a discount factor to each score based on its position in the sorted list. The discount factor is provided by the `diversityDiscountProvider.discount` function, which takes a score and an index and returns a discounted score. If the entity ID is undefined, the method returns the original scores without applying any discounts.

The discounted scores are then stored in a map that maps candidate IDs to scores. Finally, the method returns a sequence of feature maps, where each feature map contains a single `ScoreFeature` with the discounted score for the corresponding candidate.

This scorer can be used in the larger project to improve the diversity of tweets shown to users in their home feed. It can be combined with other scorers to produce a composite score that takes into account various factors such as relevance, recency, and diversity. For example, the composite score could be used to rank the tweets and select the top N tweets to show to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the DiversityScorer class?
- The DiversityScorer class discounts scores of each consecutive tweet from the same entity based on the discount factor provided.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the apply method?
- The inputs of the apply method are a ScoredTweetsQuery and a sequence of CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]. The output is a Stitch of a sequence of FeatureMap.

3. What is the purpose of the Stitch library in this code?
- The Stitch library is used to wrap the output of the apply method in a monadic context, allowing for asynchronous and error-handling operations to be performed on the output.
