The `HomeMixerAlertConfig` object defines default notification configurations for alerts related to the Home Mixer service. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for configuring alerts that can be shared across multiple products. 

The `DefaultNotificationGroup` object defines a default notification group that can be used for all alerts. This group includes email destinations for warning and critical alerts. 

The `BusinessHours` object defines default alerts for three different types of issues: empty response rates, success rates, and latency. Each alert includes a notification group, which can be customized if needed. 

The `defaultEmptyResponseRateAlert` method creates an `EmptyResponseRateAlert` object with a warning threshold and a critical threshold. This alert is triggered if the empty response rate for a product exceeds the specified thresholds. 

The `defaultSuccessRateAlert` method creates a `SuccessRateAlert` object with a threshold, number of datapoints past the threshold for warning and critical alerts, and a duration. This alert is triggered if the success rate for a product falls below the specified threshold. 

The `defaultLatencyAlert` method creates a `LatencyAlert` object with a latency threshold, number of datapoints past the threshold for warning and critical alerts, a duration, and a percentile. This alert is triggered if the latency for a product exceeds the specified threshold. 

Overall, this code provides a way to configure alerts for the Home Mixer service that can be shared across multiple products. By defining default notification groups and alerts, it simplifies the process of setting up alerts for new products and ensures consistency across the service. 

Example usage:
```
val emptyResponseAlert = HomeMixerAlertConfig.BusinessHours.defaultEmptyResponseRateAlert(60, 90)
val successRateAlert = HomeMixerAlertConfig.BusinessHours.defaultSuccessRateAlert(99.0, 10, 20, 60)
val latencyAlert = HomeMixerAlertConfig.BusinessHours.defaultLatencyAlert(500.millis, 20, 30, 60, P99)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines alert configurations for the HomeMixer service in Twitter, including default notification groups and alert types such as EmptyResponseRateAlert, SuccessRateAlert, and LatencyAlert.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several classes from the com.twitter.conversions and com.twitter.product_mixer packages, which may have their own dependencies.

3. How can these alert configurations be customized?
- The DefaultNotificationGroup can be customized by changing the email addresses in the Destination objects. The default alert thresholds and parameters can be customized by passing in different values to the functions that create the alert objects.
