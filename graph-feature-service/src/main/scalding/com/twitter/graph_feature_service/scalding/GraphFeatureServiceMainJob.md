The `GraphFeatureServiceMainJob` is a trait that defines a Scalding job for extracting and processing graph features from Twitter's interaction graph. The job extracts a subgraph from the real graph and takes the top K by real graph weight. The subgraph can be a follow graph, mutual follow graph, favorite graph, retweet graph, or mention graph. The extracted subgraph is then written to HDFS in both key-value and value-key formats.

The job reads data from several sources, including `InteractionGraphHistoryAggregatedEdgeSnapshotScalaDataset`, `RealGraphInScoresScalaDataset`, and `UserAuditFinalScalaDataset`. It also uses several constants defined in `Configs` to configure the job, such as `EnableValueGraphs`, `EnableKeyGraphs`, `BaseHdfsPath`, and `NumGraphShards`.

The job defines several helper methods, such as `getShardIdForUser`, `extractFeature`, and `getSubGraph`. `getShardIdForUser` takes a user ID and returns the shard ID for that user. `extractFeature` takes a list of `TEdgeFeature` objects and a `FeatureName` and returns the value of the feature with that name. `getSubGraph` takes an input graph, an edge filter function, and a counter, and returns a subgraph that contains the top K nodes by real graph weight.

The job also defines several constants and variables, such as `keyInj`, `valueInj`, `bufferSize`, `maxNumKeys`, `numReducers`, and `outputStreamBufferSize`. These constants and variables are used to configure the HDFS writer and the graph sharding functions.

The main method of the job is `runOnDateRange`, which takes two optional boolean parameters, `enableValueGraphs` and `enableKeyGraphs`. If both parameters are false, the job is skipped. Otherwise, the job extracts the subgraphs and writes them to HDFS in both key-value and value-key formats. The method returns an `Execution` object that can be executed to run the job.

Overall, the `GraphFeatureServiceMainJob` is a Scalding job that extracts and processes graph features from Twitter's interaction graph. The job can extract several types of subgraphs and write them to HDFS in both key-value and value-key formats. The job is configurable through several constants and variables, and can be skipped if no subgraphs need to be extracted.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for a job that extracts subgraphs from a real graph and writes them to a database for use in Twitter's graph feature service.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of this code?
- The inputs are various datasets related to Twitter user interactions, such as user audits and interaction graph snapshots. The outputs are subgraphs of the real graph, such as follow graphs and mention graphs, written to a database.

3. What is the significance of the `shardingFunction` parameter in the `writeGraphToDB` method?
- The `shardingFunction` parameter determines how the keys and values in the graph are partitioned across different shards in the database. It takes in a key and value and returns an integer representing the shard ID for that key-value pair.
