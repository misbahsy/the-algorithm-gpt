This code defines three traits that are used as base classes for jobs in the Graph Feature Service of Twitter. The purpose of these traits is to provide a common structure and functionality for adhoc and scheduled jobs that operate on graph data. 

The `GraphFeatureServiceBaseJob` trait defines a function `runOnDateRange` that takes in optional boolean parameters `enableValueGraphs` and `enableKeyGraphs` and returns an `Execution` object. This function is the main entry point for the job logic and is expected to be implemented by each job that uses this trait. The trait also defines a function `printerCounters` that takes in an `Execution` object and prints customized counters in the log. 

The `GraphFeatureServiceAdhocBaseApp` trait extends `TwitterExecutionApp` and `GraphFeatureServiceBaseJob` and provides a default implementation for the `job` function. This function reads the command line arguments to get the date range for the job and calls `printerCounters(runOnDateRange())` to execute the job logic. This trait is used for adhoc jobs that are run manually.

The `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledBaseApp` trait extends `TwitterScheduledExecutionApp` and `GraphFeatureServiceBaseJob` and provides a default implementation for the `scheduledJob` function. This function sets up the `AnalyticsBatchExecutionArgs` object with the batch description, starting date, and batch increment, and calls `AnalyticsBatchExecution` to execute the job logic. This trait is used for scheduled jobs that run daily.

Overall, these traits provide a consistent structure for graph feature service jobs and make it easier to write and test new jobs. Here is an example of how a job can be defined using these traits:

```
class MyGraphJob(args: Args) extends Job(args) with GraphFeatureServiceAdhocBaseApp {
  override def runOnDateRange(
    enableValueGraphs: Option[Boolean] = None,
    enableKeyGraphs: Option[Boolean] = None
  )(
    implicit dateRange: DateRange,
    timeZone: TimeZone,
    uniqueID: UniqueID
  ): Execution[Unit] = {
    // job logic goes here
    Execution.unit
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GraphFeatureServiceBaseJob` trait?
- The `GraphFeatureServiceBaseJob` trait defines a function that each job needs to implement and provides a method for printing customized counters in the log.

2. What is the difference between `GraphFeatureServiceAdhocBaseApp` and `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledBaseApp`?
- `GraphFeatureServiceAdhocBaseApp` is used for adhoc jobs, while `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledBaseApp` is used for scheduled jobs. `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledBaseApp` requires the definition of a starting date and a batch increment.

3. What is the purpose of the `printerCounters` method?
- The `printerCounters` method takes an `Execution` and prints customized counters in the log. It sorts the counters by group and counter, and prints the group, counter, and value for each counter.
