The code defines a case class called `GraphContainer` that contains a map of `GraphKey` to `AutoUpdatingGraph`. The purpose of this class is to hold multiple graphs and provide a way to access them. The `GraphKey` is a unique identifier for each graph, and the `AutoUpdatingGraph` is a graph data structure that can be updated automatically.

The `GraphContainer` class also defines a `toPartialMap` method that returns a map of `EdgeType` to `AutoUpdatingGraph`. This method filters the original map of graphs and only includes those that are of type `PartialValueGraph`. The resulting map can be used to access only the partial value graphs in the container.

The `warmup` method is defined to load all the graphs from a constantDB format to memory. This method returns a `Future` that completes when all the graphs have been loaded. The `Future.collect` method is used to execute the `warmup` method on each graph in the container in parallel. The `unit` method is called on the resulting `Future` to discard the result and only wait for completion.

This code is likely part of a larger project that involves working with graphs. The `GraphContainer` class provides a way to store and access multiple graphs, and the `AutoUpdatingGraph` data structure allows for automatic updates to the graph. The `toPartialMap` method is useful for accessing only the partial value graphs in the container. The `warmup` method is used to load the graphs from a database into memory, which is a common operation when working with large graphs. Overall, this code provides a foundation for working with graphs in a scalable and efficient manner. 

Example usage:

```scala
val graph1 = AutoUpdatingGraph()
val graph2 = PartialValueGraph(EdgeType.FOLLOWER)
val container = GraphContainer(Map(GraphKey("graph1") -> graph1, GraphKey("graph2") -> graph2))

// Access a specific graph
val myGraph = container.graphs(GraphKey("graph1"))

// Access only the partial value graphs
val partialGraphs = container.toPartialMap

// Load all graphs into memory
container.warmup
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GraphContainer` class?
- The `GraphContainer` class is used to contain a map of `AutoUpdatingGraph` objects, with each graph associated with a `GraphKey`.

2. What is the purpose of the `toPartialMap` method?
- The `toPartialMap` method returns a map of `AutoUpdatingGraph` objects that correspond to `PartialValueGraph` objects in the `graphs` map, with the keys being the `EdgeType` of each `PartialValueGraph`.

3. What does the `warmup` method do?
- The `warmup` method loads all the graphs from a constantDB format to memory, using the `warmup` method of each `AutoUpdatingGraph` object in the `graphs` map. It returns a `Future` that completes when all the warmup operations have finished.
