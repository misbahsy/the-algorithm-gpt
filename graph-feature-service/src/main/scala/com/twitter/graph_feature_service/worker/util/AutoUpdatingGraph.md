The `AutoUpdatingGraph` class is responsible for downloading and updating graph data from HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and providing read-only access to the graph data. The class extends the `AutoUpdatingReadOnlyGraph` class and implements the `ConstDBImporter` trait. 

The constructor of the `AutoUpdatingGraph` class takes several parameters, including the path to the data on HDFS, the HDFS cluster where updates are checked and graph files are downloaded from, the shard of the graph to download, the minimum size for a complete graph (otherwise it is not loaded), and various intervals for updates and deletion of older data. The `sharedSemaphore` parameter is an optional `AsyncSemaphore` that controls the number of graph loads that can occur simultaneously on the instance. 

The class uses the `Injection` class from the `com.twitter.bijection` package to convert between `Long` and `ByteBuffer` types. The `keyInj` field is an injection from `Long` to `ByteBuffer`, and the `valueInj` field is an identity injection from `ByteBuffer` to `ByteBuffer`. 

The `get` method overrides the `get` method of the `AutoUpdatingReadOnlyGraph` class and returns a `Future` that resolves to an optional `ByteBuffer` for the given `targetId`. The method also updates a statistic for the size of the returned byte buffer. 

Overall, the `AutoUpdatingGraph` class provides a convenient way to download and update graph data from HDFS and access it in a read-only manner. It can be used in the larger project to provide graph data for various algorithms and analyses. 

Example usage:

```
val graph = AutoUpdatingGraph(
  dataPath = "/path/to/graph/data",
  hdfsCluster = "my-hdfs-cluster",
  hdfsClusterUrl = "hdfs://my-hdfs-cluster-url",
  shard = 0,
  minimumSizeForCompleteGraph = 1000L
)

val targetId = 12345L
val result = graph.get(targetId)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a case class called `AutoUpdatingGraph` that extends `AutoUpdatingReadOnlyGraph` and `ConstDBImporter`. It is used to download and update graph files from HDFS cluster and import them into a ConstDB. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to efficiently load and update graph data for use in a graph feature service.

2. What are the default values for the updateIntervalMin, updateIntervalMax, and deleteInterval parameters?
- The default value for `updateIntervalMin` is 1 hour, the default value for `updateIntervalMax` is 12 hours, and the default value for `deleteInterval` is 2 seconds.

3. What is the purpose of the `sharedSemaphore` parameter and how is it used?
- The `sharedSemaphore` parameter is an optional `AsyncSemaphore` that controls the number of graph loads that can occur at the same time on the instance. It is used to limit the number of concurrent graph loads to prevent overloading the system.
