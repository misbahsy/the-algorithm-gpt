This code defines a set of classes and objects that are used to represent different types of graphs in the context of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The graphs are defined based on the type of edges they contain, which are represented by the EdgeType enum from the com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala package.

The GraphKey trait is a base trait that defines a common interface for all graph keys. It has a single abstract method, edgeType, which returns the EdgeType of the graph. The PartialValueGraph trait extends GraphKey and is used to represent graphs that have partial values associated with their edges.

The FollowingPartialValueGraph, FollowedByPartialValueGraph, and MutualFollowPartialValueGraph objects are all subclasses of PartialValueGraph and represent different types of graphs. FollowingPartialValueGraph represents a graph of users that a given user is following, FollowedByPartialValueGraph represents a graph of users that are following a given user, and MutualFollowPartialValueGraph represents a graph of users that are mutually following each other.

These objects are likely used throughout the larger project to represent different types of graphs and to perform operations on them. For example, the FollowingPartialValueGraph object could be used to retrieve a list of users that a given user is following, while the MutualFollowPartialValueGraph object could be used to find pairs of users that are mutually following each other.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to represent different types of graphs in the context of a larger project, and allows for easy integration with other parts of the project that may need to work with these graphs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
   This code defines a set of sealed traits and objects that represent different types of graph keys for a graph feature service. A smart developer might want to know how these graph keys are used in the larger project and what functionality they enable.

2. What is the significance of the `edgeType` property in the `GraphKey` trait?
   The `edgeType` property is a required property for any implementation of the `GraphKey` trait. A smart developer might want to know why this property is important and how it is used in the larger project.

3. Are there any other types of graph keys that could be added to this code?
   This code defines three types of graph keys, but there may be other types of graph keys that could be added in the future. A smart developer might want to know if there are any plans to add additional graph keys and how they would be implemented.
