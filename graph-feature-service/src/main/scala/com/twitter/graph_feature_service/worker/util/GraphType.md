This code defines a set of classes and objects that are used to help the GraphContainer in the larger project choose the appropriate data structure to answer queries. The code defines a sealed trait called GraphType, which is a base class for a set of objects that represent different types of graphs. The objects are FollowGraph, FavoriteGraph, RetweetGraph, ReplyGraph, MentionGraph, and MutualFollowGraph.

Each of these objects represents a different type of graph that can be used to answer queries. For example, the FollowGraph object represents a graph that shows the followers of a particular user, while the RetweetGraph object represents a graph that shows the retweets of a particular tweet.

By using these objects, the GraphContainer can choose the appropriate data structure to answer a particular query. For example, if the query is asking for the followers of a particular user, the GraphContainer can use the FollowGraph object to choose the appropriate data structure.

Overall, this code is an important part of the larger project because it helps to ensure that the GraphContainer is able to efficiently answer queries by choosing the appropriate data structure. Without this code, the GraphContainer would have to rely on a single data structure for all queries, which could lead to inefficiencies and slower performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the GraphContainer and how does it use these GraphType classes?
   The code only defines the GraphType classes and does not provide information on how they are used by the GraphContainer. A smart developer might want to know more about the GraphContainer and its implementation to understand the role of these classes.

2. Are there any other GraphType classes that could be added in the future?
   The code only defines six GraphType classes, and a smart developer might wonder if there are any other types of graphs that could be added in the future. They might also want to know if the GraphType classes are extensible.

3. Can GraphType instances be created outside of this file?
   The code defines the GraphType classes as objects, which means they are singletons. A smart developer might want to know if instances of these classes can be created outside of this file or if they are only intended to be used within this package.
