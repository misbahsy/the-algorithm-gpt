The `WorkerGetIntersectionHandler` class is responsible for handling requests to compute the intersection of features between a user and a set of candidate users. The class implements the `RequestHandler` interface, which requires the implementation of the `apply` method that takes a `WorkerIntersectionRequest` object and returns a `Future` of `WorkerIntersectionResponse`.

The `apply` method first increments a counter to keep track of the number of candidate users in the request. It then extracts the user ID and candidate user IDs from the request object. The feature types to be considered in the intersection calculation are also extracted from the request object.

The method then retrieves the left and right edges of the feature types and creates maps of the right edges for each candidate user and the left edges for the user. These maps are obtained from a `GraphContainer` object that contains partial graphs of the edges. The partial graphs are queried using the `toPartialMap` method of the `GraphContainer` object.

The intersection calculation is performed using the `IntersectionValueCalculator` object, which takes the left and right edges of a feature type and computes the intersection value. The intersection value is a measure of the similarity between the left and right edges of a feature type for a user and a candidate user. The intersection value is computed for each feature type and for each candidate user.

The result of the intersection calculation is a `WorkerIntersectionResponse` object that contains a list of `WorkerIntersectionValue` objects. Each `WorkerIntersectionValue` object represents the intersection value for a candidate user and a feature type. The `WorkerIntersectionResponse` object is returned as a `Future` value.

Overall, the `WorkerGetIntersectionHandler` class is an important component of the larger project that computes the intersection of features between a user and a set of candidate users. The class uses partial graphs of the edges to efficiently compute the intersection values for each feature type and candidate user. The intersection values can be used to rank the candidate users based on their similarity to the user for each feature type.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a handler for a worker that receives a request to compute the intersection of features between a user and a set of candidate users in a graph. It solves the problem of computing the intersection of features between two sets of nodes in a graph.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries and modules, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.util`, `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.worker.util`, `com.twitter.servo.request`, and `com.twitter.util.Future`.

3. What metrics are being tracked in this code and why?
- This code tracks several metrics related to the performance of the intersection calculation, including the total number of candidate users, the latency of converting partial graph queries to maps, the latency of converting partial graph queries from maps, and the computation latency of the intersection calculation itself. These metrics are tracked to monitor the performance of the worker and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization.
