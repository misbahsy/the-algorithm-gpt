The code defines a sealed trait called `GfsQuery` and a case class called `ToPartialQuery`. The `GfsQuery` trait has two abstract methods: `edgeType` and `userId`. The `ToPartialQuery` case class extends the `GfsQuery` trait and implements its abstract methods. 

The purpose of this code is to define a query object that can be used to search for edges between any users to users in a local partition. The `ToPartialQuery` case class takes in two parameters: `edgeType` and `userId`. `edgeType` is of type `EdgeType`, which is defined in another file, and represents the type of edge being searched for. `userId` is of type `Long` and represents the user ID being searched for. 

This code can be used in the larger project to create and execute queries for searching edges between users in a local partition. For example, a function could be created that takes in a `ToPartialQuery` object and uses it to search for edges between users in a local partition. 

Here is an example of how this code could be used:

```
import com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala.EdgeType
import com.twitter.graph_feature_service.worker.util.ToPartialQuery

def searchForEdges(query: ToPartialQuery): List[EdgeType] = {
  // code to search for edges between users in a local partition using the query object
  // returns a list of EdgeType objects representing the edges found
}

val query = ToPartialQuery(EdgeType.Follows, 123456789)
val results = searchForEdges(query)
println(results)
```

In this example, a `ToPartialQuery` object is created with an `EdgeType` of `Follows` and a `userId` of `123456789`. The `searchForEdges` function takes in this query object and uses it to search for edges between users in a local partition. The results are then printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GfsQuery` trait and how is it used in the project?
- The `GfsQuery` trait is used to define a common interface for different types of queries in the project. It includes two abstract methods `edgeType` and `userId` that must be implemented by any class that extends the trait.

2. What is the significance of the `ToPartialQuery` case class and how does it relate to the `GfsQuery` trait?
- The `ToPartialQuery` case class extends the `GfsQuery` trait and provides a concrete implementation of the `edgeType` and `userId` methods. It represents a query to search for edges between any users to users in a local partition.

3. What is the purpose of the `EdgeType` import statement and where is it defined in the project?
- The `EdgeType` import statement is used to import the `EdgeType` class from the `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala` package. This class is defined in a separate file or module within the project and is used to represent different types of edges in the graph.
