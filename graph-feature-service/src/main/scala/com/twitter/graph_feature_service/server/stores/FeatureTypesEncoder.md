The `FeatureTypesEncoder` object in the `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.server.stores` package is responsible for encoding a sequence of `FeatureType` objects into a string representation. This encoding is done using the `MurmurHash3` hash function, which is a non-cryptographic hash function that produces a 32-bit hash value. 

The `apply` method of the `FeatureTypesEncoder` object takes a sequence of `FeatureType` objects as input and returns a string representation of the hash value produced by `MurmurHash3`. The input sequence is first converted into a byte array by flattening each `FeatureType` object into a pair of bytes representing the left and right edge types. These bytes are then concatenated into a single byte array. 

The `MurmurHash3.bytesHash` method is then called with the byte array and a `RandomSeed` value from the `Configs` object. This produces a 32-bit hash value, which is then converted to a string representation by calling the `toString` method. The hash value is also bitwise ANDed with `0x7fffffff` to ensure that it is positive.

This encoding process is useful for generating a unique identifier for a set of `FeatureType` objects, which can be used to cache or retrieve data associated with those features. For example, in a graph feature service, the encoded string could be used as a key to retrieve precomputed feature data from a cache or database. 

Here is an example usage of the `FeatureTypesEncoder` object:

```scala
import com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala.FeatureType
import com.twitter.graph_feature_service.server.stores.FeatureTypesEncoder

val featureTypes = Seq(
  FeatureType(leftEdgeType = EdgeType.FOLLOWER, rightEdgeType = EdgeType.FOLLOWING),
  FeatureType(leftEdgeType = EdgeType.FOLLOWING, rightEdgeType = EdgeType.FOLLOWER)
)

val encoded = FeatureTypesEncoder(featureTypes)
println(encoded) // prints something like "1234567890"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an object called `FeatureTypesEncoder` that has a method to encode a sequence of `FeatureType` objects into a string using MurmurHash3 algorithm.

2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?
- The input of the `apply` method is a sequence of `FeatureType` objects. The output is a string that represents the encoded hash value of the input.

3. What is the significance of the `RandomSeed` and `0x7fffffff` in the code?
- The `RandomSeed` is used as a seed value for the MurmurHash3 algorithm to ensure that the hash value is not predictable. The `0x7fffffff` is used to keep the hash value positive.
