The `GetIntersectionStore` class is a Scala implementation of a `ReadableStore` that retrieves intersection results from a graph feature service. The class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `multiGet` method is the main method of the class. It takes a set of `GetIntersectionQuery` objects as input and returns a map of `CachedIntersectionResult` objects. The method first checks if the input set is empty. If it is, it returns an empty map. Otherwise, it increments a request counter and extracts the `userId`, `featureTypes`, `presetFeatureTypes`, `calculatedFeatureTypes`, and `intersectionIdLimit` from the first `GetIntersectionQuery` object in the set. It then creates a `WorkerIntersectionRequest` object using this information and sends it to a set of graph feature service workers. The method collects the responses from the workers and passes them to the `gfsIntersectionResponseAggregator` method, which merges the responses into a single result. Finally, the method maps each `GetIntersectionQuery` object to its corresponding `CachedIntersectionResult` object and returns the resulting map.

The `gfsIntersectionResponseAggregator` method takes a list of `WorkerIntersectionResponse` objects as input and returns a map of `CachedIntersectionResult` objects. The method first creates a 3D array called `cube` to store the intersection counts, left node degrees, and right node degrees for each candidate and feature type. It also creates a 2D array called `ids` to store the intersection IDs for each candidate and feature type. The method then iterates over the `WorkerIntersectionResponse` objects and updates the `cube` and `ids` arrays accordingly. Finally, the method maps each candidate to its corresponding `CachedIntersectionResult` object and returns the resulting map.

Overall, the `GetIntersectionStore` class provides a way to retrieve intersection results from a graph feature service. It sends a request to a set of workers, aggregates the responses, and returns the results in a map. The class is designed to be used as part of a larger system that uses graph features to make predictions or recommendations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a store for retrieving cached intersection results from a graph feature service. It solves the problem of reducing the number of requests to the service by caching results for future use.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Finagle, ThriftScala, and Twitter Util. It also depends on other classes and modules within the project such as GraphFeatureServiceWorkerClients and ServerGetIntersectionHandler.

3. How does the gfsIntersectionResponseAggregator function work?
- The gfsIntersectionResponseAggregator function takes in a list of WorkerIntersectionResponse objects and aggregates their results into a single CachedIntersectionResult object. It does this by iterating through each response and extracting the relevant data, which is then stored in a multidimensional array. Finally, the data is mapped to a CachedIntersectionResult object and returned.
