The `FeatureTypesCalculator` object in the `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.util` package is responsible for calculating and returning a set of feature types used in the larger project. 

The `FeatureTypesCalculator` object contains several `Seq` and `final val` variables that hold different sets of feature types. These feature types are represented by `FeatureType` objects, which are defined in the `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala` package. Each `FeatureType` object represents a pair of `EdgeType` objects, which are also defined in the same package. 

The `DefaultTwoHop` `Seq` variable holds a set of `FeatureType` objects that represent pairs of `EdgeType` objects that are two hops away from each other. These `EdgeType` objects include `Following`, `FollowedBy`, `FavoritedBy`, `RetweetedBy`, `MentionedBy`, and `MutualFollow`. 

The `SocialProofTwoHop` `Seq` variable holds a set of `FeatureType` objects that represent pairs of `EdgeType` objects that are two hops away from each other and are related to social proof. This set only includes the `Following` and `FollowedBy` `EdgeType` objects. 

The other `final val` variables hold copies of the `DefaultTwoHop` and `SocialProofTwoHop` sets, with some variations. 

The `presetFeatureTypes` variable is a `Set` that holds the union of all the `Seq` variables defined above. This set represents all the feature types that are used in the project. 

The `getFeatureTypes` method takes in two parameters: a `PresetFeatureTypes` object and a `Seq` of `FeatureType` objects. The method returns a `Seq` of `FeatureType` objects. If the `PresetFeatureTypes` object matches one of the preset types defined in the `final val` variables, the method returns the corresponding set of feature types. Otherwise, the method returns the `Seq` of `FeatureType` objects passed in as a parameter. 

Overall, the `FeatureTypesCalculator` object is used to calculate and return a set of feature types used in the larger project. The `getFeatureTypes` method allows for customization of the feature types returned based on the `PresetFeatureTypes` object passed in as a parameter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a set of preset feature types for a graph feature service. It is likely used to generate features for machine learning models or other data analysis tasks.
2. What is the difference between the DefaultTwoHop and SocialProofTwoHop feature sets?
- The DefaultTwoHop set includes a wider range of edge types, while the SocialProofTwoHop set only includes the "Following" and "FollowedBy" edge types. This suggests that the SocialProofTwoHop set may be more focused on social network analysis.
3. What is the purpose of the getFeatureTypes function and how is it used?
- The getFeatureTypes function takes in a preset feature type and a sequence of feature types, and returns either the preset feature types or the input feature types depending on the value of the preset feature type. It is likely used to allow users to select from a set of predefined feature types or to specify their own custom feature types.
