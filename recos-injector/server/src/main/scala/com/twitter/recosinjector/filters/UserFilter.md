The `UserFilter` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to filter users based on their safety level and labels. The class takes a `Gizmoduck` client and a `StatsReceiver` as input parameters. The `Gizmoduck` client is used to fetch user information and the `StatsReceiver` is used to record statistics about the filtering process.

The class has two methods: `filterByUser` and `filterByUserId`. The `filterByUser` method takes a `userId` and an optional `User` object as input parameters. If the `User` object is provided, it is used to filter the user. Otherwise, the `Gizmoduck` client is used to fetch the user information. The method first checks if the user is safe by calling the `isUnsafe` method, which checks if the user is deactivated, suspended, restricted, NSFW, or protected. If the user is safe, the method then checks if the user has a high-precision NSFW label by calling the `hasNsfwHighPrecisionLabel` method. If the user is safe and does not have a high-precision NSFW label, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. The `filtered` counter is incremented if the user is not valid.

The `filterByUserId` method takes a `userId` as an input parameter and uses the `Gizmoduck` client to fetch the user information. The method first checks if the user is safe by calling the `isUnsafe` method. If the user is safe, the method then checks if the user has a high-precision NSFW label by calling the `hasNsfwHighPrecisionLabel` method. If the user is safe and does not have a high-precision NSFW label, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. The `filtered` counter is incremented if the user is not valid.

Overall, the `UserFilter` class is used to filter users based on their safety level and labels. It can be used in the larger project to ensure that only safe and appropriate users are allowed to perform certain actions. For example, it can be used to filter users who are posting content on a social media platform to ensure that the content is appropriate for all audiences. 

Example usage:

```
val gizmoduckClient = new Gizmoduck()
val userFilter = new UserFilter(gizmoduckClient)(statsReceiver)

val userId = 12345
val userOpt = Some(User(...))
val isValidUser = userFilter.filterByUser(userId, userOpt).getOrElse(false)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a UserFilter class that provides methods for filtering user objects based on certain criteria, using a Gizmoduck client to retrieve user data.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the Finagle and Gizmoduck libraries from Twitter, as well as the Future class from the Twitter Util library.

3. What are the potential risks of using the `filterByUser` method instead of `filterByUserId`?
- The `filterByUser` method may allow invalid users to pass the filter if the user object provided by the caller is not valid, since it bypasses Gizmoduck's safety level. It is recommended to use `filterByUserId` instead, which applies Gizmoduck's safety level while querying for the user.
