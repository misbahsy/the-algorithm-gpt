The `UserTweetEntityEdgeBuilder` class is responsible for building edges between users and tweet entities (such as URLs) in the Twitter ecosystem. The class takes in a cache object (`RecosHoseEntitiesCache`) and a URL resolver object (`UrlResolver`) as dependencies. The `getEntitiesMapAndUpdateCache` method is the main method of the class, which takes in a tweet ID and tweet details as input and returns a future that resolves to an optional map of entity recommendations.

The `getEntitiesMapAndUpdateCache` method first calls the `getResolvedUrls` method of the `UrlResolver` object to get a list of resolved URLs from the tweet details. It then hashes the resolved URLs using the `getHashedEntities` method and stores the hash-to-entity mapping in the cache using the `storeEntitiesInCache` method. Finally, it returns a map of entity recommendations, where the key is the recommendation type (in this case, URL) and the value is a list of hashed entity IDs.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to build edges between users and tweet entities in the Twitter ecosystem. These edges can then be used to power recommendation algorithms and other data-driven features. The class uses a cache to store the hash-to-entity mapping, which allows for more efficient storage and retrieval of the data. The `UrlResolver` object is used to resolve shortened URLs and other URL-related details from the tweet, which is necessary for building the URL-related edges.

Example usage:

```scala
val cache = new RecosHoseEntitiesCache()
val urlResolver = new UrlResolver()
val builder = new UserTweetEntityEdgeBuilder(cache, urlResolver)

val tweetId = 1234567890L
val tweetDetails = Some(TweetDetails(urls = Some(Seq("https://t.co/abc123"))))
val entitiesMapFut = builder.getEntitiesMapAndUpdateCache(tweetId, tweetDetails)

entitiesMapFut.onSuccess { entitiesMapOpt =>
  entitiesMapOpt match {
    case Some(entitiesMap) =>
      // Use the entities map to power recommendation algorithms or other features
    case None =>
      // No entities found in the tweet
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `UserTweetEntityEdgeBuilder` that provides methods for getting and storing hashed entities in a cache. It is used to save space in UTEG edges and recover actual entities from their hashIds.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.graphjet.algorithms.RecommendationType`, `com.twitter.recosinjector.clients.CacheEntityEntry`, `com.twitter.recosinjector.clients.RecosHoseEntitiesCache`, `com.twitter.recosinjector.clients.UrlResolver`, `com.twitter.recosinjector.util.TweetDetails`, and `com.twitter.util.Future`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `getEntitiesMapAndUpdateCache` method?
- The `getEntitiesMapAndUpdateCache` method takes a `tweetId` and an optional `tweetDetails` object as input and returns a `Future` that resolves to an optional `Map[Byte, Seq[Int]]`. The method resolves the URLs in the tweetDetails object, stores their hashedIds in a cache, and returns a mapping of GraphJet recType to hash(entity).
