This code defines two case classes, `UserTweetEntityEdge` and `UserUserEdge`, which represent edges in two different graphs: `user_tweet_author_graph` and `user_user_graph`. Both classes extend a trait called `Edge`, which defines two methods: `convertToRecosHoseMessage` and `convertToUserTweetAuthorGraphMessage`. These methods convert the edge objects to two different Thrift structs: `RecosHoseMessage` and `UserTweetAuthorGraphMessage`. 

`RecosHoseMessage` is consumed by the graphs, while `UserTweetAuthorGraphMessage` is consumed only by `user_tweet_author_graph`. The `convertToRecosHoseMessage` method is implemented in both case classes, while `convertToUserTweetAuthorGraphMessage` is implemented only in `UserTweetEntityEdge`. 

`UserTweetEntityEdge` captures user-tweet interactions such as create, like, retweet, reply, etc. It takes in several parameters such as `sourceUser`, `targetTweet`, `action`, `cardInfo`, `metadata`, `entitiesMap`, and `tweetDetails`. `sourceUser` and `targetTweet` are the IDs of the user and tweet involved in the interaction, respectively. `action` is an enum that represents the type of interaction. `cardInfo`, `metadata`, and `entitiesMap` are optional parameters that provide additional information about the interaction. `tweetDetails` is an optional parameter that contains details about the tweet, such as whether it has a photo, video, URL, or hashtag. 

`UserUserEdge` captures user-user interactions such as follow, mention, and mediatag. It takes in `sourceUser`, `targetUser`, `action`, and `metadata` as parameters. `sourceUser` and `targetUser` are the IDs of the users involved in the interaction, while `action` and `metadata` provide information about the type of interaction and any additional metadata, respectively. 

Overall, this code provides a way to convert user-tweet and user-user interactions into Thrift structs that can be consumed by graphs. It is likely part of a larger project that involves analyzing user behavior on Twitter. 

Example usage:

```
val userTweetEdge = UserTweetEntityEdge(1234, 5678, Action.Create, None, None, None, Some(TweetDetails(true, false, true, false, Some(9876))))
val recosHoseMessage = userTweetEdge.convertToRecosHoseMessage
val userTweetAuthorGraphMessage = userTweetEdge.convertToUserTweetAuthorGraphMessage
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Edge` trait and its two methods?
- The `Edge` trait defines two methods that convert an edge object to different thrift structs used by different graphs.
2. What is the difference between `UserTweetEntityEdge` and `UserUserEdge`?
- `UserTweetEntityEdge` captures user-tweet interactions such as create, like, retweet, reply, etc., while `UserUserEdge` captures user-user interactions such as follow, mention, mediatag.
3. What is the purpose of the `getFeatures` method in `UserTweetEntityEdge`?
- The `getFeatures` method returns a `Features` object that contains boolean values indicating whether a tweet has a photo, video, URL, or hashtag.
