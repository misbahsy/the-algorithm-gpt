The `UrlResolver` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It is responsible for resolving URLs and filtering out Twitter-based URLs. The class has two methods, `getResolvedUrls` and `getResolvedUrls(urls: Seq[String], tweetId: Long)`, which take in a set of raw URLs and a list of URLs, respectively, and return a map of raw URLs to resolved URLs. The `getResolvedUrls` method uses the `multiGet` method of the `urlInfoStore` object to retrieve the resolved URLs for the input raw URLs. It then filters out Twitter-based URLs and returns a map of raw URLs to resolved URLs. The `getResolvedUrls(urls: Seq[String], tweetId: Long)` method first checks if the input list of URLs is empty. If it is, it returns an empty map. Otherwise, it sleeps for a duration determined by the `getUrlResolverDelayDuration` method before calling the `getResolvedUrls` method with the input list of URLs. The `getUrlResolverDelayDuration` method calculates the amount of delay needed before attempting to resolve the URLs based on the creation time of the tweet. If the tweet was created more than 12 seconds before the current time, no delay is applied. Otherwise, a delay of 4 seconds is applied.

The `UrlResolver` class uses several counters to keep track of the number of resolved URLs, Twitter-based URLs, and unresolved URLs. It also uses the `FutureOps` object to perform asynchronous operations on futures.

Example usage:

```
val urlResolver = new UrlResolver(urlInfoStore)
val rawUrls = Set("https://www.example.com", "https://www.twitter.com")
val resolvedUrls = urlResolver.getResolvedUrls(rawUrls)
resolvedUrls.foreach(println)
```

This code creates a new `UrlResolver` object with a `urlInfoStore` object and a set of raw URLs. It then calls the `getResolvedUrls` method with the set of raw URLs and prints the resulting map of raw URLs to resolved URLs. The Twitter-based URL is filtered out, and only the resolved URL for the example.com URL is returned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a UrlResolver class that resolves URLs and filters out Twitter-based URLs. It solves the problem of resolving URLs from a list of raw URLs and grouping URLs that point to the same webpage.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including com.twitter.conversions, com.twitter.finagle.stats, com.twitter.finagle.util, com.twitter.frigate.common.util, com.twitter.storehaus, and com.twitter.util.

3. What is the significance of the getUrlResolverDelayDuration method and how is it used?
- The getUrlResolverDelayDuration method calculates the amount of delay needed before attempting to resolve the URLs based on the tweet creation time. It is used in the getResolvedUrls method to sleep for the calculated duration before calling the getResolvedUrls method with the input URLs.
