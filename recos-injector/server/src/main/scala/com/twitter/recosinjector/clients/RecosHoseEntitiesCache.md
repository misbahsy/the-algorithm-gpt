The `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class is a cache layer that stores entities for graph services like `user_tweet_entity_graph` and `user_url_graph`. These services store user interactions with entities in a tweet, such as hashtags and URLs. Instead of storing the actual entity values, which can be potentially very big, the graph services store a hashed ID in the graph edge and keep a `(hashedId -> entity)` mapping in this cache. The actual entity values can be recovered by the graph service at serving time using this cache.

The `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class has a `client` parameter that is a `Client` object from the `com.twitter.finagle.memcached` package. This client is used to interact with the cache. The cache entries are stored as `CacheEntityEntry` objects, which contain a `cachePrefix`, a `hashedEntityId`, and an `entity`. The `cachePrefix` is either `"h"` for hashtags or `"u"` for URLs. The `hashedEntityId` is an integer hash of the entity, and the `entity` is the actual entity value.

The `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class has several private methods that are used to interact with the cache. The `isEntityWithinTTL` method checks if a given entity is within the time-to-live (TTL) period. The `updateRecosHoseEntities` method updates the `RecosHoseEntities` object with a new entity. The `getRecosHoseEntitiesCache` method retrieves the cache entries from the cache. The `putRecosHoseEntitiesCache` method stores the cache entries in the cache.

The `updateEntitiesCache` method is the main method of the `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class. It takes a list of new cache entries and updates the cache with them. It first retrieves the existing cache entries from the cache using the `getRecosHoseEntitiesCache` method. It then updates the cache entries with the new cache entries using the `updateRecosHoseEntities` method. Finally, it stores the updated cache entries in the cache using the `putRecosHoseEntitiesCache` method.

Overall, the `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class provides a cache layer for storing entities for graph services. It allows the graph services to store hashed IDs instead of actual entity values, which can be very large. The actual entity values can be recovered by the graph services at serving time using this cache.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class?
- The `RecosHoseEntitiesCache` class is a cache layer used to store entities for graph services like `user_tweet_entity_graph` and `user_url_graph`.

2. What is the significance of the `EntityTTL` value?
- The `EntityTTL` value represents the time-to-live for cached entities, which is set to 30 hours.

3. How are entities added to the cache?
- Entities are added to the cache by calling the `updateEntitiesCache` method, which takes a list of `CacheEntityEntry` objects and updates the cache with new entities while removing expired or invalid values.
