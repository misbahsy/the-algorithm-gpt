The `TweetEventToUserUserGraphBuilder` class is responsible for building edges in the UserUserGraph based on tweet creation events. When a new tweet is created, the class extracts the valid mentioned and mediatagged users in the tweet and creates edges for them. 

The class extends the `EventToMessageBuilder` trait, which defines methods for processing events and building edges. The `shouldProcessEvent` method determines whether an event should be processed based on the type of user interaction. Only new tweets and quotes are considered, and replies or retweets are ignored. The `buildEdges` method creates edges for the valid mentioned and mediatagged users in the tweet. The `filterEdges` method does not filter any edges.

The class uses the `UserUserEdge` class to represent edges in the UserUserGraph. Each edge has a source user, a target user, an action (either Mention or MediaTag), and metadata (the current system time). The class also uses the `TweetCreateEventDetails` class to represent tweet creation events. Each event has a user tweet engagement, which contains information about the user who created the tweet and the type of user interaction.

The class uses the `StatsReceiver` class to record statistics about the number of tweet or quote events, non-tweet or quote events, mention edges, and mediatag edges. These statistics can be used to monitor the performance of the system and identify any issues.

Overall, the `TweetEventToUserUserGraphBuilder` class plays an important role in building the UserUserGraph in the larger project. By extracting valid mentioned and mediatagged users from tweet creation events and creating edges for them, the class helps to capture user interactions and relationships in the graph. The class can be used in conjunction with other classes and components to analyze the graph and make recommendations to users. 

Example usage:

```
val builder = new TweetEventToUserUserGraphBuilder()
val event = new TweetCreateEventDetails(...)
val edges = builder.buildEdges(event)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a class called `TweetEventToUserUserGraphBuilder` that builds edges for a UserUserGraph based on a tweet creation event, specifically by extracting valid mentioned and mediatagged users in the tweet.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.recos.util.Action`, `com.twitter.recosinjector.util.TweetCreateEventDetails`, and `com.twitter.util.Future`.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a sequence of `UserUserEdge` objects, which are created based on the valid mentioned and mediatagged users in a tweet creation event.
