The `Tweetypie` class is a client for retrieving tweets using the `TweetyPie` library. It takes in a `ReadableStore` of `TweetyPieResult` objects, which are essentially containers for tweets and metadata about the tweet. The `getTweet` method takes a `tweetId` as input and returns a `Future` that resolves to an `Option[Tweet]`. 

The `getTweet` method first attempts to retrieve the `TweetyPieResult` object associated with the given `tweetId` from the `tweetyPieStore`. If successful, it maps the result to the `Tweet` object contained within the `TweetyPieResult` and returns it wrapped in an `Option`. If the retrieval fails, the method attempts to handle the failure by checking the type of exception thrown. If the exception is a `TweetyPieException`, it is likely due to attempting to query a protected or unsafe tweet. In this case, the method increments a counter for the specific `tweetState` associated with the exception and returns `Future.None`. If the exception is of any other type, the method increments a counter for the exception class name and returns `Future.None`.

This class can be used in the larger project to retrieve tweets from the `tweetyPieStore` using the `getTweet` method. The `statsReceiver` parameter allows for monitoring of the success and failure rates of tweet retrievals, which can be useful for debugging and optimizing the system. An example usage of this class might look like:

```
val tweetypieClient = new Tweetypie(tweetyPieStore)(statsReceiver)
val tweetId = 1234567890L
val tweetFuture = tweetypieClient.getTweet(tweetId)
tweetFuture.onSuccess {
  case Some(tweet) => println(tweet.text)
  case None => println("Tweet retrieval failed")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a class called `Tweetypie` that retrieves a tweet from a `ReadableStore` using the `TweetyPie` library and returns it as a `Future` wrapped in an `Option`.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.stitch.tweetypie.TweetyPie`, `com.twitter.storehaus.ReadableStore`, `com.twitter.tweetypie.thriftscala.Tweet`, and `com.twitter.util.Future` libraries.
3. What error handling is implemented in this code?
   - This code handles two types of exceptions: `TweetyPieException`, which is caught and logged with a specific counter for each tweet state, and all other exceptions, which are caught and logged with a counter for the exception class name. In both cases, the `Future` returned is `None`.
