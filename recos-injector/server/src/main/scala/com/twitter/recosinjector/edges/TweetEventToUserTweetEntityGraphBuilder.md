The `TweetEventToUserTweetEntityGraphBuilder` class in this code is responsible for building user-tweet-entity edges based on different tweet events, such as creating a tweet, replying to a tweet, retweeting, and quoting a tweet. These edges are used to represent relationships between users and tweets in the larger project.

The class has several private methods for building edges based on different tweet actions:

1. `buildReplyEdge`: Builds edges for a reply event. It creates two edges: one connecting the author to the source tweet with a Reply action, and another connecting the author to the reply tweet with a Tweet action.

2. `buildRetweetEdge`: Builds an edge for a retweet event, connecting the author to the source tweet with a Retweet action.

3. `buildQuoteEdges`: Builds edges for a quote event. It creates two edges: one connecting the author to the source tweet with a Quote action, and another connecting the author to the quote tweet with a Tweet action.

4. `buildTweetEdges`: Builds edges for a tweet event. It creates three types of edges: a tweet creation edge connecting the author to the tweet, IsMentioned edges connecting mentioned users to the tweet, and IsMediatagged edges connecting media-tagged users to the tweet.

The `buildEdges` method is the main method that calls the appropriate edge-building method based on the tweet action. The `filterEdges` method is used to filter the edges if needed, but currently, it does not apply any filtering.

Additionally, the class uses `StatsReceiver` to track various statistics, such as the number of edges created for each action type and the number of invalid actions encountered. It also interacts with the `tweetCreationStore` to read and update the last tweet creation time for a user.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TweetEventToUserTweetEntityGraphBuilder` class and how does it work with other classes like `UserTweetEntityEdgeBuilder`, `TweetCreationTimeMHStore`, and `RecosInjectorDecider`?
   
   **Answer**: The `TweetEventToUserTweetEntityGraphBuilder` class is responsible for building edges between users and tweet entities based on different tweet events (e.g., Reply, Retweet, Tweet, Quote). It works with `UserTweetEntityEdgeBuilder` to build and update entity maps, `TweetCreationTimeMHStore` to manage tweet creation times, and `RecosInjectorDecider` to decide whether to process events or not.

2. **Question**: How does the `buildEdges` method work, and what are the different types of edges it can build based on the tweet action?

   **Answer**: The `buildEdges` method takes a `TweetCreateEventDetails` object as input and builds edges between users and tweet entities based on the tweet action. It can build edges for Reply, Retweet, Tweet, and Quote actions, calling different methods like `buildReplyEdge`, `buildRetweetEdge`, `buildTweetEdges`, and `buildQuoteEdges` respectively.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `getAndUpdateLastTweetCreationTime` method, and how does it handle potential read/write race conditions?

   **Answer**: The `getAndUpdateLastTweetCreationTime` method reads the user's last tweet creation time from the MH store, updates the store with the new tweet time, and returns the last tweet time. It is an asynchronous function, so the MH write operations will continue to execute on their own, which might create read/write race conditions. However, this is expected and considered acceptable in this implementation.
