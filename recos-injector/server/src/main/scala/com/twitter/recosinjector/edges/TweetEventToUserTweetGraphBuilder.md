The `TweetEventToUserTweetGraphBuilder` class is responsible for building edges between users and tweets based on tweet creation events. It takes in a `UserTweetEntityEdgeBuilder` object, a `TweetCreationTimeMHStore` object, and a `RecosInjectorDecider` object as constructor arguments. It extends the `EventToMessageBuilder` trait, which defines methods for processing events and building edges.

The `shouldProcessEvent` method determines whether an event should be processed based on whether the `RecosInjectorDecider` object is available. If it is available, the method increments a counter and returns `true`. Otherwise, it increments a different counter and returns `false`.

The `buildEdges` method is responsible for building edges between users and tweets based on the type of action performed by the user. If the action is a retweet, the method calls the `buildRetweetEdge` method, which builds an edge between the user and the tweet being retweeted. The `buildRetweetEdge` method retrieves the details of the source tweet being retweeted and uses them to create a `UserTweetEntityEdge` object. It then increments a counter and returns a sequence containing the edge.

The `filterEdges` method is responsible for filtering the edges that were built. For now, it simply returns the original sequence of edges.

Overall, this class is an important part of the larger project as it is responsible for building edges between users and tweets, which is a crucial component of the recommendation algorithm. It can be used to identify users who are likely to be interested in certain tweets based on their engagement history. For example, if a user has retweeted several tweets about a particular topic, the algorithm may recommend more tweets on that topic to that user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and it builds a Retweet edge from author to source tweet ID.

2. What dependencies does this code have? 
- This code has dependencies on several packages and classes including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.frigate.common.store.TweetCreationTimeMHStore`, and `com.twitter.recos.internal.thriftscala.RecosUserTweetInfo`.

3. What metrics are being tracked in this code and why? 
- This code tracks the number of Retweet edges built (`numRetweetEdgesCounter`), the number of times the decider is enabled (`numIsDecider`), and the number of times the decider is not enabled (`numIsNotDecider`). These metrics are being tracked to monitor the performance and behavior of the code.
