The DedupTransform class is a part of the Twitter Follow Recommendations project and is used to remove duplicate candidates from a list of recommendations. This class extends the Transform class and takes two generic types, Request and Candidate. Request represents the input to the transform function, while Candidate represents the type of the recommendations.

The transform function takes in a target and a sequence of candidates and returns a Stitch object containing a sequence of unique candidates. The function uses a mutable HashSet to keep track of the IDs of the candidates that have already been seen. It then filters the input sequence of candidates based on whether their ID has already been seen or not. If the ID has not been seen, the candidate is added to the HashSet and included in the output sequence.

This class can be used in the larger project to ensure that the recommendations provided to users do not contain duplicates. For example, if a user is recommended to follow multiple accounts that they already follow, it may lead to a poor user experience. By using the DedupTransform class, the project can ensure that the recommendations are unique and relevant to the user.

Here is an example of how the DedupTransform class can be used:

```
val recommendations = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3, candidate1)
val dedupTransform = new DedupTransform[RequestType, CandidateType]()
val uniqueRecommendations = dedupTransform.transform(request, recommendations).get
// uniqueRecommendations will contain candidate1, candidate2, and candidate3
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
   - This code is a transform for deduplicating a sequence of candidates based on their ID. It is likely used in a recommendation system to ensure that the same candidate is not recommended multiple times to a user.
2. What is the significance of the `Stitch` class and how does it relate to the code's functionality?
   - The `Stitch` class is used to represent a computation that may or may not have completed yet. In this code, it is used to wrap the filtered sequence of candidates and return it as a `Stitch[Seq[Candidate]]` object.
3. What are the constraints on the types of `Request` and `Candidate` that can be used with this transform?
   - `Request` can be any type, but `Candidate` must be a subtype of `UniversalNoun[Long]`, which means it must have an `id` field of type `Long`.
