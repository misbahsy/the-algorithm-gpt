This code defines a case class called `RecentlyEngagedUserId` and two companion object methods to convert instances of this class to and from Thrift and offline Thrift representations. 

The `RecentlyEngagedUserId` case class has two fields: `id` of type `Long` and `engagementType` of type `EngagementType`. The purpose of this class is to represent a user ID that has recently engaged with content on Twitter, along with the type of engagement (e.g. like, retweet, reply). 

The `toThrift` method converts an instance of `RecentlyEngagedUserId` to a Thrift representation of the same object, using the `t.RecentlyEngagedUserId` Thrift struct. The `toOfflineThrift` method does the same thing, but using the `offline.RecentlyEngagedUserId` Thrift struct instead. 

The companion object provides two methods to convert Thrift and offline Thrift representations of `RecentlyEngagedUserId` back to instances of the case class. The `fromThrift` method takes a `t.RecentlyEngagedUserId` object and returns a `RecentlyEngagedUserId` instance with the same `id` and `engagementType` fields. The `fromOfflineThrift` method does the same thing, but with an `offline.RecentlyEngagedUserId` object instead. 

This code is likely used in a larger project related to Twitter's follow recommendations. The `RecentlyEngagedUserId` class may be used to represent users who have recently engaged with content related to a particular topic or user, and the Thrift conversion methods may be used to pass this information between different components of the project. For example, the `toThrift` method may be used to send a user's recently engaged content data to a recommendation engine, while the `fromThrift` method may be used to convert the recommendation engine's output back into a format that can be displayed to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the RecentlyEngagedUserId class?
- The RecentlyEngagedUserId class represents a user ID and their engagement type, and provides methods to convert to Thrift and offline Thrift formats.

2. What is the difference between the toThrift and toOfflineThrift methods?
- The toThrift method converts the RecentlyEngagedUserId object to a Thrift format, while the toOfflineThrift method converts it to an offline Thrift format.

3. What is the purpose of the RecentlyEngagedUserId object and its methods fromThrift and fromOfflineThrift?
- The RecentlyEngagedUserId object provides methods to convert RecentlyEngagedUserId objects from Thrift and offline Thrift formats back to the Scala case class format.
