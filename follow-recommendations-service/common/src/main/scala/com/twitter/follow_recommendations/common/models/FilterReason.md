[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/models/FilterReason.scala)

The code defines a sealed trait called `FilterReason` and its various implementations as case objects and case classes. Each implementation has a `reason` string that describes the reason for filtering a user from a recommendation list. 

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves recommending Twitter users to follow. The `FilterReason` trait and its implementations are used to filter out users who do not meet certain criteria. For example, a user may be filtered out because they have already been recommended, they are inactive, or they have a high tweet velocity. 

The `FilterReason` implementations are used to provide more specific information about why a user was filtered out. For example, a user may be filtered out because they are not discoverable via the address book or phone book, or because they have opted out from the criteria in the request. 

This code can be used in conjunction with other code that generates a list of recommended users. The list can then be filtered using the `FilterReason` implementations to remove users who do not meet certain criteria. 

Example usage:
```scala
val recommendedUsers: List[User] = generateRecommendedUsers()
val filteredUsers = recommendedUsers.filterNot(user => shouldFilter(user))

def shouldFilter(user: User): Boolean = {
  // Check if user should be filtered based on various criteria
  user.isInactive || user.hasHighTweetVelocity || user.isAlreadyRecommended
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a sealed trait `FilterReason` and its various case classes and objects that represent different reasons for filtering a user from a recommendation list.

2. What is the significance of the `sealed` keyword before the `trait` declaration?
- The `sealed` keyword restricts the inheritance of the `FilterReason` trait to this file only, meaning that all possible subtypes of `FilterReason` must be declared in this file.

3. What is the purpose of the `reason` field in each case class/object?
- The `reason` field is a string that represents the reason for filtering a user. It is used to identify the specific reason for filtering a user in logs and other debugging tools.
