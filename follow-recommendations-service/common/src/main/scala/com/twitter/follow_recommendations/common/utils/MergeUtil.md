The `MergeUtil` object contains a method called `weightedRoundRobin` that takes a sequence of items with weights and returns an infinite stream of each item by their weights. The weights of all items must be greater than or equal to zero, and the sum of weights should be greater than zero. 

The method uses an implicit parameter called `weighted` of type `Weighted[T]` to get the weight of each item. The `Weighted` trait is not defined in this file, so it must be defined elsewhere in the project. 

The method first checks if the input sequence is empty and returns an empty stream if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative weight of each item and checks if the sum of weights is positive. If any of the weights are negative or the sum of weights is not positive, the method throws an assertion error. 

The method then defines a `next` function that recursively generates the infinite stream of items. It uses a `weightIdx` variable to keep track of the current item index and a `weight` variable to keep track of the current weight. It updates these variables based on the weights of the items and returns the next item in the stream. 

This method can be used in the larger project to generate a weighted round-robin sampling of items. For example, if the project needs to recommend Twitter accounts to follow based on their popularity, this method can be used to generate an infinite stream of accounts to recommend based on their follower count. 

Example usage of this function:

```scala
case class Account(name: String, followers: Int)

implicit val weightedAccount = new Weighted[Account] {
  def apply(a: Account): Double = a.followers.toDouble
}

val accounts = Seq(
  Account("user1", 100),
  Account("user2", 200),
  Account("user3", 50)
)

val recommendedAccounts = MergeUtil.weightedRoundRobin(accounts)
```

In this example, the `Account` case class represents a Twitter account with a name and a follower count. The `weightedAccount` implicit parameter is defined to get the weight of each account based on its follower count. The `accounts` sequence contains three accounts with different follower counts. The `weightedRoundRobin` method is called with the `accounts` sequence and returns an infinite stream of accounts based on their follower counts. The `recommendedAccounts` variable contains the infinite stream of recommended accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Weighted` trait and how is it used in this code?
- The `Weighted` trait is used to provide weights for items in the `weightedRoundRobin` function. It is implicitly passed as a parameter to the function.

2. What happens if the input sequence of items is empty?
- If the input sequence of items is empty, the function returns an empty stream.

3. What is the time complexity of the `weightedRoundRobin` function?
- The time complexity of the `weightedRoundRobin` function is O(n), where n is the number of items in the input sequence. This is because the function iterates through the sequence once to calculate the weights and cumulative weights, and then iterates through the sequence again to generate the stream.
