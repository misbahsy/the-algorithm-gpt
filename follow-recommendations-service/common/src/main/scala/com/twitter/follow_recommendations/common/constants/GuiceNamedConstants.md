[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/constants/GuiceNamedConstants.scala)

The code defines a set of constants for various components and features used in the Twitter Follow Recommendations project. These constants are used to identify and reference specific components within the project. 

For example, the constant `COSINE_FOLLOW_FETCHER` refers to a component that fetches follow recommendations based on cosine similarity. Similarly, `USER_RECOMMENDABILITY_FETCHER` refers to a component that fetches a user's recommendability score. 

These constants are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and avoid hard-coding of component names. For instance, if a component is renamed or replaced, the constant can be updated in one place, rather than having to update all references to that component throughout the codebase. 

The constants are organized into categories such as fetchers, loggers, and scorers, making it easier to locate and reference related components. 

Overall, this code serves as a central repository for identifying and referencing various components and features within the Twitter Follow Recommendations project. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.constants.GuiceNamedConstants._

// Use the cosine follow fetcher component
val followFetcher = injector.getInstance(Key.get(classOf[FollowFetcher], Names.named(COSINE_FOLLOW_FETCHER)))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a set of constants for various fetchers, scanners, and loggers used in the Twitter Follow Recommendations project.
2. What is the significance of the "GuiceNamedConstants" object?
   - The "GuiceNamedConstants" object is used to define named constants that can be injected into classes using the Guice dependency injection framework.
3. What are some examples of the fetchers, scanners, and loggers defined in this code?
   - Examples of fetchers include "cosine_follow_fetcher", "curated_candidates_fetcher", and "user_user_graph_fetcher". Examples of scanners include "profile_sidebar_blacklist_scanner" and "dismiss_store_scanner". An example of a logger is "CLIENT_EVENT_LOGGER".
