[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/models/HasMutualFollowedUserIds.scala)

The code defines a trait called `HasMutualFollowedUserIds` which is a part of the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models` package. The trait is used to find the intersection of recent followers and followed by users. 

The trait extends two other traits, `HasRecentFollowedUserIds` and `HasRecentFollowedByUserIds`, which provide the recent followed and followed by user IDs respectively. The `recentFollowedUserIds` and `recentFollowedByUserIds` are options that may or may not have values. 

The `HasMutualFollowedUserIds` trait has two lazy values, `recentMutualFollows` and `numRecentMutualFollows`. The `recentMutualFollows` value is a sequence of long integers that represent the intersection of the recent followed and followed by user IDs. If either of the options is empty, the value defaults to an empty list. The `numRecentMutualFollows` value is the size of the `recentMutualFollows` sequence.

This trait can be used in the larger project to recommend users to follow based on mutual follows. For example, if a user follows user A and user B, and user A also follows user C, then the algorithm can recommend user B to follow user C since they have a mutual follow with user A. 

Here is an example of how this trait can be used:

```scala
class User extends HasMutualFollowedUserIds {
  val recentFollowedUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(Seq(1, 2, 3))
  val recentFollowedByUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(Seq(2, 3, 4))
}

val user = new User()
println(user.recentMutualFollows) // prints Seq(2, 3)
println(user.numRecentMutualFollows) // prints 2
```

In this example, a `User` class extends the `HasMutualFollowedUserIds` trait and provides values for the `recentFollowedUserIds` and `recentFollowedByUserIds` options. The `recentMutualFollows` and `numRecentMutualFollows` values are then accessed and printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a trait called `HasMutualFollowedUserIds` which calculates the intersection of recent followers and followed by users and provides the count of mutual follows.

2. What other traits or classes does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on two other traits called `HasRecentFollowedUserIds` and `HasRecentFollowedByUserIds`.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
   - The expected output of this code is a sequence of `Long` values representing the recent mutual follows and an `Int` value representing the count of recent mutual follows.
