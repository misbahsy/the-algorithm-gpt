The `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` class is a candidate ranker that mixes and ranks multiple candidate lists from different candidate sources. It takes in a base ranker, a shuffle function, and a boolean flag for deduplication. 

The `rank` method takes in a target and a sequence of candidate users, groups them by candidate source identifier, sorts and shuffles the candidates per candidate source, and then merges the ranked lists generated from each candidate source into a single list using weighted random sampling. If deduplication is required, it removes duplicated candidates from the final output. 

The `group` method groups the candidates by candidate source identifier. The `rankCandidates` method sorts and shuffles the candidates per candidate source, and then merges the ranked lists generated from each candidate source into a single list using the base ranker. If deduplication is required, it removes duplicated candidates from the final output. 

The `build` method in the `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` object creates a new instance of the `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` class with the given candidate source weight, shuffle function, deduplication flag, and random seed. The `build` method in the `WeightedCandidateSourceRankerWithoutRandomSampling` object creates a new instance of the `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` class with the given candidate source weight and without random sampling. 

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves recommending users to follow on Twitter. The `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` class is used to rank and merge candidate lists from different candidate sources, which could include sources such as "who to follow" recommendations, "similar accounts" recommendations, and "trending accounts" recommendations. The resulting list of ranked candidates could then be used to generate personalized recommendations for users to follow on Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a candidate ranker that mixes and ranks multiple candidate lists from different candidate sources.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `rank` function?
- The `rank` function takes in a `Target` object and a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects, and outputs a `Stitch` object containing a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects.

3. What is the difference between `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` and `WeightedCandidateSourceRankerWithoutRandomSampling`?
- `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker` uses weighted random sampling to merge and rank candidate lists, while `WeightedCandidateSourceRankerWithoutRandomSampling` uses weighted round-robin instead.
