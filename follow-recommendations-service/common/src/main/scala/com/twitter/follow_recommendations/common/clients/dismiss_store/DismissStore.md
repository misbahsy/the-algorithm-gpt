The `DismissStore` class is a component of the Twitter Follow Recommendations system that retrieves a list of dismissed candidates since a certain time. It is primarily used for filtering out accounts that a user has explicitly dismissed. 

The class is implemented as a singleton and is injected with a `Scanner` object and a `StatsReceiver` object. The `Scanner` object is used to scan the dismissed candidates and the `StatsReceiver` object is used to record statistics about the scanning process.

The `get` method of the `DismissStore` class takes in three parameters: `userId`, `negStartTimeMs`, and `maxCandidatesToFetchOption`. The `userId` parameter is the ID of the user whose dismissed candidates are being retrieved. The `negStartTimeMs` parameter is the time since which the dismissed candidates are being retrieved. The `maxCandidatesToFetchOption` parameter is an optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of candidates to fetch. If this parameter is not specified, the default number of candidates to fetch is used.

The `get` method uses the `Scanner` object to scan the dismissed candidates and returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of candidate IDs. The `Stitch` object is a Twitter-specific abstraction that represents a computation that may fail with a `Throwable` or succeed with a value of type `A`. 

The `scan` method of the `Scanner` object is called with a tuple that contains the `userId` and a `Slice` object. The `Slice` object specifies the range of dismissed candidates to fetch and the maximum number of candidates to fetch. The `scan` method returns a sequence of tuples that contain the candidate ID and the details of the dismissal event. The `map` method is then called on the sequence to extract the candidate IDs and return them as a sequence of `Long` values.

Overall, the `DismissStore` class provides a way to retrieve dismissed candidates for a user and is an important component of the Twitter Follow Recommendations system. An example usage of the `DismissStore` class is shown below:

```
val dismissStore = new DismissStore(scanner, stats)
val userId = 12345L
val negStartTimeMs = System.currentTimeMillis() - (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 24 hours ago
val maxCandidatesToFetchOption = Some(50)
val dismissedCandidates = dismissStore.get(userId, negStartTimeMs, maxCandidatesToFetchOption).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a DismissStore class that retrieves a list of dismissed candidates for a user. It is used for filtering out accounts that a user has explicitly dismissed and is likely used in the recommendation system of the larger project.

2. What is the significance of the MaxCandidatesToReturn constant and how is it used?
- MaxCandidatesToReturn is a private constant that sets the maximum number of candidates to return if no limit is specified. It is used in the get method to determine the maximum number of candidates to fetch if no limit is specified.

3. What happens if there is an error other than a timeout and how is it handled?
- The code fails loudly on errors other than timeouts. This means that if there is an error, it will be logged and raised as an exception.
