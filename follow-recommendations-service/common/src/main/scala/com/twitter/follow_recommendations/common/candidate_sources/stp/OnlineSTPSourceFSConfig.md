The code is a Scala class that defines a configuration for a feature switch related to candidate sources for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm. Specifically, it configures the feature switch for an online Short-Term Personalization (STP) source. 

The class extends the `FeatureSwitchConfig` trait, which defines methods for retrieving and updating feature switch parameters. The `OnlineSTPSourceFSConfig` class overrides the `booleanFSParams` method to define a sequence of two feature switch parameters, both of which are boolean values. These parameters are defined in the `OnlineSTPSourceParams` object, which is not shown in this code snippet. 

The purpose of this configuration is to allow for easy toggling of certain features related to the online STP source. For example, the `DisableHeavyRanker` parameter may be used to turn off a heavy ranking algorithm that is used in the STP source. Similarly, the `UseDBv2Scorer` parameter may be used to switch to a different scoring algorithm. 

This configuration class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and modules that make up the larger follow recommendations algorithm. For example, the `OnlineSTPSource` class may use this configuration to determine which features to enable or disable based on the current state of the feature switch. 

Here is an example of how this configuration may be used:

```
val stpConfig = new OnlineSTPSourceFSConfig()
val disableRanker = stpConfig.booleanFSParams.exists(_.name == "DisableHeavyRanker") && stpConfig.booleanFSParams.find(_.name == "DisableHeavyRanker").get.value
if (disableRanker) {
  // do something if the heavy ranker is disabled
} else {
  // do something else if the heavy ranker is enabled
}
```

In this example, the `stpConfig` object is created using the `OnlineSTPSourceFSConfig` class. The `disableRanker` variable is then set to `true` if the `DisableHeavyRanker` parameter is present and set to `true` in the configuration. This variable can then be used to conditionally execute different code paths based on the state of the feature switch.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is defining a configuration class for feature switches related to an online STP (Short Term Planning) candidate source in the Twitter Follow Recommendations project. It is likely used to control certain behaviors or options within the candidate source.

2. What are the specific feature switches being configured in this class?
- The class is defining two boolean feature switches: DisableHeavyRanker and UseDBv2Scorer. These switches likely control whether or not certain ranking or scoring algorithms are used within the candidate source.

3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations on the class?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of this class should be created and shared across the application. The @Inject annotation indicates that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected into other classes that depend on it. These annotations are likely used to ensure that the feature switch configuration is consistent and easily accessible throughout the application.
