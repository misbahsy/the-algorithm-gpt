The `TriangularLoopsSource` class is a candidate source for the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm. It extends the `CandidateSource` class and overrides its `apply` method to return a `Stitch` of candidate users. The `TriangularLoopsSource` class takes a `TriangularLoopsV2OnUserClientColumn` object as a constructor parameter. 

The `apply` method first checks if the `target` object has a user ID. If it does, it uses the `TriangularLoopsV2OnUserClientColumn` object to fetch a list of candidates and maps them to `CandidateUser` objects using the `mapCandidatesToCandidateUsers` method. If the `target` object has a parameter to keep only candidates who follow the target user, it filters out candidates who do not follow the target user using the `filterOutCandidatesNotFollowingTargetUser` method. The `apply` method returns the resulting `Stitch` of candidate users.

The `filterOutCandidatesNotFollowingTargetUser` method takes a `Stitch` of candidate users and an optional list of recent followings. It maps the `Stitch` of candidate users to a new `Stitch` of candidate users that only includes candidates who are in the list of recent followings.

The `mapCandidatesToCandidateUsers` method takes a `Candidates` object and maps it to a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. It maps each candidate to a `CandidateUser` object with a score based on the number of followers and followings, and a reason based on the social proof of the candidate.

Overall, the `TriangularLoopsSource` class provides a way to fetch and filter candidate users for the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm based on triangular loops. It can be used as a component in the larger algorithm to generate follow recommendations for Twitter users. 

Example usage:
```
val triangularLoopsSource = new TriangularLoopsSource(triangularLoopsV2Column)
val target = new HasParams with HasClientContext with HasRecentFollowedByUserIds {
  override def getOptionalUserId: Option[Long] = Some(1234567890)
  override def params: Map[String, String] = Map(TriangularLoopsParams.KeepOnlyCandidatesWhoFollowTargetUser -> "true")
  override def recentFollowedByUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(Seq(9876543210, 2468101214))
}
val stitch: Stitch[Seq[CandidateUser]] = triangularLoopsSource.apply(target)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm, specifically for the Triangular Loop algorithm. It provides a list of recommended users for a given target user based on their recent followers and other factors.

2. What dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several dependencies, including models for account proof, candidate users, and follow proof, as well as the Hermit and Strato libraries and the Triangular Loop algorithm.

3. How are the recommended users filtered and sorted?
- The recommended users are filtered based on whether or not they follow the target user, and are sorted by their score (which is calculated based on the number of followers and followings they have) in descending order. The top 100 users are returned as recommendations.
