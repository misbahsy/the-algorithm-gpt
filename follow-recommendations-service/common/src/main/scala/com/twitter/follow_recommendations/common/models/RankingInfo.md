The code defines a case class called `RankingInfo` which contains two optional fields: `scores` and `rank`. The purpose of this class is to represent information about the ranking of a user's followers. The `scores` field is an optional instance of another case class called `Scores`, which is not defined in this file. The `rank` field is an optional integer that represents the user's rank in the follower list.

The `RankingInfo` class also defines two methods: `toThrift` and `toOfflineThrift`. These methods convert an instance of `RankingInfo` to Thrift objects of type `t.RankingInfo` and `offline.RankingInfo`, respectively. The `t.RankingInfo` and `offline.RankingInfo` objects are defined in other files and are used for communication between different components of the larger project.

The `RankingInfo` object also defines a method called `fromThrift` which takes an instance of `t.RankingInfo` and returns an instance of `RankingInfo`. This method is used to convert Thrift objects back to instances of the `RankingInfo` class.

Overall, this code provides a way to represent and convert information about a user's follower ranking in the larger project. It is likely used in conjunction with other components to provide recommendations for users to follow based on their ranking and other factors. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```scala
val scores = Some(Scores(10, 20, 30))
val rank = Some(1)
val rankingInfo = RankingInfo(scores, rank)

val thriftRankingInfo = rankingInfo.toThrift
// send thriftRankingInfo to another component of the project

val offlineThriftRankingInfo = rankingInfo.toOfflineThrift
// send offlineThriftRankingInfo to a logging component of the project

val fromThriftRankingInfo = RankingInfo.fromThrift(thriftRankingInfo)
// convert thriftRankingInfo back to a RankingInfo instance
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RankingInfo` class and its methods?
- The `RankingInfo` class is used to store information about a ranking, including scores and rank. Its `toThrift` method converts the information to a Thrift object, while `toOfflineThrift` converts it to an offline Thrift object. The `fromThrift` method converts a Thrift object to a `RankingInfo` instance.

2. What is the relationship between `RankingInfo` and the `Scores` class?
- The `RankingInfo` class has an optional `scores` field of type `Scores`, which is used to store scores related to the ranking. The `toThrift` and `toOfflineThrift` methods of `RankingInfo` call the corresponding methods of `Scores` to convert the scores to Thrift objects.

3. What is the purpose of the `RankingInfo` object?
- The `RankingInfo` object has a single method `fromThrift` that converts a Thrift object to a `RankingInfo` instance. This is likely used in other parts of the project to convert Thrift objects to domain objects.
