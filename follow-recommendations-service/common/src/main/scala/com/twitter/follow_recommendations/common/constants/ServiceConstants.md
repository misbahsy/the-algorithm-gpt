[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/constants/ServiceConstants.scala)

The code defines two constants, `StringLengthLimit` and `ContainerLengthLimit`, which are used to limit the size of responses from a Thrift client. The purpose of these limits is to prevent the client from sending too much data over the network, which could cause performance issues or even crashes.

The `StringLengthLimit` constant is set to 10 megabytes, while the `ContainerLengthLimit` constant is set to 1 megabyte. These values were estimated based on monitoring data from a dashboard, which showed that the network usage per second was around 3 megabytes, and the client was making around 25 requests per second. This means that each request should ideally use no more than 120 kilobytes of data, but the constants provide some buffer in case some requests require more data than others.

These constants are likely used throughout the larger project to ensure that responses from Thrift clients are properly limited in size. For example, if a client sends a request that would result in a response larger than the `StringLengthLimit` or `ContainerLengthLimit`, the server may return an error or truncate the response to fit within the limits.

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in a Thrift service implementation:

```scala
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.constants.ServiceConstants

class MyThriftServiceImpl extends MyThriftService {
  def getSomeData(request: MyRequest): Future[MyResponse] = {
    // do some processing to generate a response
    val response = generateResponse(request)

    // check if the response is too large
    if (response.stringData.length > ServiceConstants.StringLengthLimit ||
        response.containerData.length > ServiceConstants.ContainerLengthLimit) {
      // return an error if the response is too large
      Future.exception(new ResponseTooLargeException())
    } else {
      // return the response if it is within the size limits
      Future.value(response)
    }
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines constants for the size limits of thrift client responses in the Twitter Follow Recommendations project.

2. How were the size limits estimated?
- The size limits were estimated using a monitoring dashboard, with a calculation based on network usage per second and requests per second.

3. Why is there a buffer included in the size limits?
- A buffer is included in case some requests require more data than others, allowing for flexibility in the size of the responses.
