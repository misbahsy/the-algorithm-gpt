The code above defines a case class called GeohashAndCountryCode. This class has two properties: geohash and countryCode, both of which are optional strings. 

The purpose of this class is to represent a geographic location and its corresponding country code. The geohash property is a string that represents a specific location on the Earth's surface using a hierarchical spatial data structure. The countryCode property is a string that represents the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for the location. 

This class may be used in the larger project to provide location information for users or other entities. For example, if the project involves recommending Twitter users to follow based on their location, this class could be used to store the location information for each user. 

Here is an example of how this class could be used in code:

```
val location = GeohashAndCountryCode(Some("9q8y"), Some("US"))
```

In this example, a new instance of the GeohashAndCountryCode class is created with a geohash of "9q8y" and a countryCode of "US". This instance could then be used to represent a specific location in the United States.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the GeohashAndCountryCode case class?
   - The GeohashAndCountryCode case class is used to represent a combination of a geohash and a country code, both of which are optional.

2. What other models are included in the com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models package?
   - It is unclear from this code snippet what other models are included in the com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models package. Further exploration of the package would be necessary to answer this question.

3. How is the GeohashAndCountryCode case class used within the larger project?
   - Without additional context, it is impossible to determine how the GeohashAndCountryCode case class is used within the larger project. Additional exploration of the project's codebase would be necessary to answer this question.
