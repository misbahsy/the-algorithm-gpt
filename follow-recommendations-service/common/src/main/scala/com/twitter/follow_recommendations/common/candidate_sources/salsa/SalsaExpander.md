The `SalsaExpander` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for expanding a list of input user ids into a list of recommended candidate users. The class uses pre-computed lists of candidates for each input user id and returns the highest scored candidates in the pre-computed lists as the expansion for the corresponding input id.

The class takes three inputs: `firstDegreeInput`, `secondDegreeInput`, and `maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn`. `firstDegreeInput` and `secondDegreeInput` are lists of user ids for which the recommended candidates are to be generated. `maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn` is the maximum number of recommended candidates to be returned for each input user id.

The `SalsaExpander` class has a private method `similarUsers` that takes two inputs: `input` and `neighbors`. `input` is a list of user ids for which the recommended candidates are to be generated. `neighbors` is a list of pre-computed candidate lists for each user id in `input`. The `similarUsers` method returns a list of `SalsaExpandedCandidate` objects. Each `SalsaExpandedCandidate` object contains the candidate id, the number of connections, the total score, and the connecting users for a candidate user.

The `SalsaExpander` class has a public method `apply` that takes three inputs: `firstDegreeInput`, `secondDegreeInput`, and `maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn`. The `apply` method returns a `Stitch` object that contains a list of recommended candidate users. The `apply` method first fetches the pre-computed candidate lists for each user id in `firstDegreeInput` and `secondDegreeInput`. It then calls the `similarUsers` method to generate a list of `SalsaExpandedCandidate` objects. Finally, it sorts the `SalsaExpandedCandidate` objects by the total score, selects the top `maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn` candidates, and converts them to `CandidateUser` objects.

The `SalsaExpander` class has four companion object variables: `MaxDirectNeighbors`, `MaxIndirectNeighbors`, `MinConnectingUsersThreshold`, and `MaxConnectingUsersToOutputPerExpandedCandidate`. These variables are used to set the maximum number of direct neighbors, the maximum number of indirect neighbors, the minimum number of connecting users, and the maximum number of connecting users to output per expanded candidate, respectively.

Example usage:

```scala
val expander = new SalsaExpander(statsReceiver, firstDegreeClient, secondDegreeClient)
val input = Seq(123, 456, 789)
val maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn = 10
val result: Seq[CandidateUser] = expander(input, Seq.empty, maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the SalsaExpander class and how does it work?
- The SalsaExpander class uses pre-computed lists of candidates for each input user ID and returns the highest scored candidates in the pre-computed lists as the expansion for the corresponding input ID. It does this by collecting first and second-degree neighbors for the input IDs, grouping similar users, and ranking them by combined weights from connecting users.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the apply method in the SalsaExpander class?
- The apply method takes in firstDegreeInput (a sequence of Long), secondDegreeInput (a sequence of Long), and maxNumOfCandidatesToReturn (an Int) as inputs. It returns a Stitch of a sequence of CandidateUser.

3. What is the purpose of the SalsaExpandedCandidate case class and how is it used?
- The SalsaExpandedCandidate case class represents a candidate user with their ID, number of connections, total score, and connecting users. It is used to convert a similar user candidate to a candidate user in the toCandidateUser method and to group similar users in the similarUsers method.
