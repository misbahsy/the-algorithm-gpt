The code above is a module for a client called Gizmoduck, which is used to communicate with a service called UserService. The module is written in Scala and uses the Finatra framework. The purpose of this module is to provide a client for the UserService that can be used in other parts of the larger project.

The module imports several libraries, including Google Guice, Finatra, and Gizmoduck. It defines a singleton object called GizmoduckModule, which extends a BaseClientModule and implements the MtlsClient trait. The BaseClientModule is a class that provides some basic functionality for creating a client module, while the MtlsClient trait is used to enable mutual TLS for the client.

The GizmoduckModule object provides two methods using the @Provides annotation. The first method, provideExtraGizmoduckQueryFields, returns an empty set of QueryFields. QueryFields is a class from the Gizmoduck library that is used to specify which fields should be returned by a query. The second method, providesStitchClient, returns a new instance of the Gizmoduck class, which is created using the futureIface parameter. The futureIface parameter is an instance of the UserService.MethodPerEndpoint class, which is generated by the Finagle Thrift compiler.

The Gizmoduck class is a wrapper around the Finagle Thrift client, which provides a more convenient API for making Thrift requests. It takes an instance of the UserService.MethodPerEndpoint class as a parameter and provides methods for making requests to the UserService. The Gizmoduck class is used in other parts of the larger project to communicate with the UserService.

Overall, this module provides a client for the UserService that can be used in other parts of the larger project. It uses the Finatra framework and the Gizmoduck library to create a convenient API for making Thrift requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a module for a client called Gizmoduck that communicates with a Thrift service called UserService. It provides extra query fields and a Stitch client for the service.
2. What other modules or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on the BaseClientModule, MtlsClient, and Gizmoduck libraries, as well as the QueryFields and UserService classes from the Thrift service.
3. What is the significance of the "@Provides" and "@Singleton" annotations in this code?
   - The "@Provides" annotation is used to indicate that a method provides a dependency that can be injected by Guice. The "@Singleton" annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the provided dependency should be created and shared across the application.
