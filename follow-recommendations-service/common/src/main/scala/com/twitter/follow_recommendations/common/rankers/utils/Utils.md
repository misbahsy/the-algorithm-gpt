The code in this file provides utility functions for ranking and scoring candidate users in the context of the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `addRankingInfo` function takes a list of `CandidateUser` objects and a `rankingStage` string as input, and returns a new list of `CandidateUser` objects with ranking and scoring information added. The function uses the `zipWithIndex` method to iterate over each candidate in the input list and add the ranking and scoring information using the `addInfoPerRankingStage` method of the `CandidateUser` class. The ranking is 1-based for better readability. This function is likely used in the larger project to generate a ranked list of candidate users based on various scoring criteria.

The `getCandidateScoreByRankerId` function takes a `CandidateUser` object and a `RankerId` enum value as input, and returns an optional `Score` object representing the score of the candidate user for the given ranker. The function uses the `flatMap` method to extract the score for the given ranker from the `scores` field of the `CandidateUser` object. This function is likely used in the larger project to retrieve the score of a candidate user for a specific ranker.

The `getAllRankerIds` function takes a list of `CandidateUser` objects as input, and returns a list of all unique `RankerId` enum values present in the scores of the candidate users. The function uses `flatMap` and `distinct` methods to extract and filter the `RankerId` values from the `scores` field of the `CandidateUser` objects. This function is likely used in the larger project to retrieve a list of all available rankers for scoring candidate users.

Overall, this file provides useful utility functions for ranking and scoring candidate users in the context of The Algorithm from Twitter project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility functions for ranking and scoring candidate users in a Twitter follow recommendations system.

2. What is the input and output of the `addRankingInfo` function?
- The input is a list of `CandidateUser` objects and a `String` representing the ranking stage. The output is a modified list of `CandidateUser` objects with ranking and scoring information added.

3. What is the purpose of the `getCandidateScoreByRankerId` function?
- This function retrieves the score of a candidate user based on a given `RankerId`. It returns an `Option[Score]` object, which may be empty if the candidate does not have a score for the given ranker.
