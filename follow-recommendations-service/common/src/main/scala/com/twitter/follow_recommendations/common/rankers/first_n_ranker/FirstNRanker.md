The `FirstNRanker` class is a ranker that filters candidates between stages of the main ranker by taking the first N candidates and merging any candidate source information for candidates with multiple entries. This class is designed to be used as a separate ranker that can be chained any number of times sequentially within the main ranking builder. 

The `FirstNRanker` class extends the `Ranker` class and takes two type parameters: `Target` and `CandidateUser`. The `Target` type parameter is a type that extends `HasClientContext`, `HasParams`, and `HasQualityFactor`. The `CandidateUser` type parameter is a type that represents a candidate user. 

The `FirstNRanker` class has a `rank` method that takes a `Target` object and a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects as input and returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. The `rank` method first calculates the scale-down factor based on the quality factor and the minimum number of candidates to be scored. It then calculates the number of candidates to be ranked by multiplying the number of candidates to be ranked by the scale-down factor. The `rank` method then adds the rank of each candidate based on the primary candidate source's score. In the event where the provided ordering of candidates do not align with the score, the method will respect the score, since the ordering might have been mixed up due to other previous steps like the shuffle function in the `WeightedCandidateSourceRanker`. The method then groups duplicate candidates and merges their candidate source information. Finally, the method returns the top N candidates based on the calculated number of candidates to be ranked. 

The `FirstNRanker` class has a private `merge` method that takes a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects as input and returns a single merged `CandidateUser` object. The `merge` method uses the primary candidate source of the first entry and aggregates all of the other entries' candidate source scores into the first entry's candidateSourceScores. 

The `FirstNRanker` class has several private variables that are used for tracking statistics. These variables include `baseStats`, `scaledDownByQualityFactorCounter`, `mergeStat`, `mergeStat2`, `mergeStat3`, `mergeStat4`, and `candidateSizeStats`. 

Overall, the `FirstNRanker` class is an important component of the larger project as it provides a way to filter and rank candidates between stages of the main ranker.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a ranker that filters candidates between stages of the main ranking builder by taking the first N candidates and merging any candidate source information for candidates with multiple entries. It is meant to be used sequentially within the main ranking builder.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.base.Ranker`, and `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.CandidateUser`.
3. What is the significance of the `scaleDownFactor` variable and how is it calculated?
- The `scaleDownFactor` variable is used to scale down the number of candidates to rank based on the target's quality factor and a minimum scale down factor specified in the parameters. It is calculated as the maximum of the target's quality factor and the minimum scale down factor, and is used to determine the number of candidates to rank.
