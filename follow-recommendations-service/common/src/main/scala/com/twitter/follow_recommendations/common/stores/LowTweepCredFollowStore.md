The `LowTweepCredFollowStore` class is a Scala implementation of a store that retrieves low TweepCred users. TweepCred is a score that Twitter assigns to users based on their activity and engagement on the platform. The purpose of this store is to retrieve a list of users who have a low TweepCred score and who have been recently followed by a target user. 

The `getLowTweepCredUsers` method takes a `target` parameter of type `HasRecentFollowedUserIds`, which is an interface that defines a method to retrieve a list of recently followed user IDs. The method first retrieves a list of recently followed user IDs from the `target` parameter, and then filters the list to retrieve only the first `NumFlockToRetrieve` users. This value is set to 500 by default. 

The method then uses the `tweepCredOnUserClientColumn` parameter to retrieve the TweepCred score for each user in the filtered list. The `tweepCredOnUserClientColumn` is an instance of the `TweepCredOnUserClientColumn` class, which is a client for the TweepCred service. The `fetcher` method of the `tweepCredOnUserClientColumn` instance is used to retrieve the TweepCred score for each user in the filtered list. 

The TweepCred score is then compared to the `TweepCredThreshold` value, which is set to 40 by default. If the TweepCred score is less than the threshold, the user ID is added to a list of valid user IDs. The method then returns a list of `CandidateUser` objects, which are users that are candidates for following. Each `CandidateUser` object contains a user ID and a default candidate score. 

This store can be used in the larger project to recommend low TweepCred users to follow. The `getLowTweepCredUsers` method can be called with a `target` parameter to retrieve a list of low TweepCred users that have been recently followed by the target user. This list can then be used to recommend users to follow based on their low TweepCred score. 

Example usage:

```
val lowTweepCredFollowStore = new LowTweepCredFollowStore(tweepCredOnUserClientColumn)
val targetUser = new HasRecentFollowedUserIds {
  override def recentFollowedUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(Seq(123456789, 987654321))
}
val lowTweepCredUsers = lowTweepCredFollowStore.getLowTweepCredUsers(targetUser).unsafeGet()
// lowTweepCredUsers is a list of CandidateUser objects with low TweepCred scores
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `LowTweepCredFollowStore` that retrieves a list of low "tweep cred" users to recommend for follow based on a given target user's recent followed users. It solves the problem of recommending relevant users to follow on Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries and modules, including `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, `com.twitter.strato.generated.client.onboarding.userrecs.TweepCredOnUserClientColumn`, `javax.inject.Inject`, and `javax.inject.Singleton`.

3. What are the values of `NumFlockToRetrieve` and `TweepCredThreshold`, and how were they determined?
- `NumFlockToRetrieve` is set to 500 and `TweepCredThreshold` is set to 40. It is unclear how these values were determined without additional context or documentation.
