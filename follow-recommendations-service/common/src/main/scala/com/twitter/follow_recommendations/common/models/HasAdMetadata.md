[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/models/HasAdMetadata.scala)

The code defines a Scala case class called AdMetadata and a trait called HasAdMetadata. AdMetadata has two fields: insertPosition, an integer, and adImpression, an object of type t.AdImpression. HasAdMetadata has three methods: adMetadata, adImpression, and insertPosition. adMetadata returns an optional AdMetadata object, while adImpression and insertPosition return optional values of their respective fields in AdMetadata. Additionally, HasAdMetadata has a method called isPromotedAccount, which returns a boolean indicating whether adMetadata is defined or not.

This code is likely used in a larger project related to Twitter's ad server. AdMetadata appears to represent metadata associated with an advertisement, including its insertion position and impression information. HasAdMetadata is likely a trait that is mixed into other classes that need to access this metadata. For example, a class representing a promoted tweet or account may extend HasAdMetadata to access the ad metadata associated with it.

Here is an example of how this code may be used:

```
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models._

// create an AdMetadata object
val metadata = AdMetadata(1, t.AdImpression())

// create a class representing a promoted tweet that has this metadata
case class PromotedTweet(text: String, adMetadata: Option[AdMetadata]) extends HasAdMetadata

// create a promoted tweet with the metadata we created earlier
val tweet = PromotedTweet("Check out our new product!", Some(metadata))

// access the insertion position of the ad metadata
val position = tweet.insertPosition // returns Some(1)

// access the ad impression information
val impression = tweet.adImpression // returns Some(t.AdImpression())

// check if the tweet is a promoted account
val isPromoted = tweet.isPromotedAccount // returns true
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AdMetadata` case class?
   - The `AdMetadata` case class is used to store information about an advertisement, including its insertion position and impression data.

2. What is the `HasAdMetadata` trait used for?
   - The `HasAdMetadata` trait is used to define a common interface for classes that have associated `AdMetadata` information, including methods to access the insertion position and impression data.

3. What is the purpose of the `isPromotedAccount` method?
   - The `isPromotedAccount` method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the associated object has `AdMetadata` information, and can therefore be considered a promoted account.
