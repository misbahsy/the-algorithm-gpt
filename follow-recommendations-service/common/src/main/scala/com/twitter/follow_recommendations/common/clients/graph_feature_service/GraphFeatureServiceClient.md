The `GraphFeatureServiceClient` class is a client for the Graph Feature Service, which is a service that provides features for Twitter's social graph. Specifically, this client is used to retrieve intersections between a user and a set of candidate users in the social graph. The purpose of this functionality is to provide recommendations for users to follow based on their connections in the graph.

The `getIntersections` method takes a user ID, a sequence of candidate user IDs, and a number of intersection IDs to retrieve. It returns a `Stitch` object that represents a future computation of a map from candidate user IDs to `FollowProof` objects. A `FollowProof` object contains a sequence of intersection IDs and a count of the number of times those intersections occur in the social graph.

Internally, the `getIntersections` method calls the `getPresetIntersection` method of the Graph Feature Service with a `GfsPresetIntersectionRequest` object that specifies the user ID, candidate user IDs, and the type of intersection to retrieve (`WtfTwoHop`). It then processes the response from the service to extract the `FollowProof` objects for each candidate user.

The processing of the response involves filtering the intersection results for each candidate user to only include those with the correct left and right edge types (`Following` and `FollowedBy`, respectively), and then mapping those results to `FollowProof` objects. The resulting `FollowProof` objects are then collected into a map from candidate user IDs to `FollowProof` objects.

Overall, this client is an important component of the larger recommendation system for Twitter's social graph. It allows for efficient retrieval of intersection information, which is used to generate recommendations for users to follow. An example usage of this client might look like:

```
val client = new GraphFeatureServiceClient(graphFeatureService)
val userId = 12345L
val candidateIds = Seq(67890L, 54321L, 98765L)
val numIntersectionIds = 10
val followProofs = client.getIntersections(userId, candidateIds, numIntersectionIds).get()
println(followProofs)
```

This code creates a new `GraphFeatureServiceClient` with a `GraphFeatureService` object, and then retrieves the intersection information for user ID 12345 and candidate user IDs 67890, 54321, and 98765, with a limit of 10 intersection IDs per candidate. The resulting `FollowProof` objects are then printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a client for the Graph Feature Service API that retrieves intersection data between a user and a set of candidates. It solves the problem of recommending new users to follow on Twitter based on common followings.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `com.twitter.graph_feature_service.thriftscala` and `com.twitter.stitch` libraries.

3. What is the expected output of the `getIntersections` method?
- The expected output of the `getIntersections` method is a `Stitch` that maps candidate IDs to `FollowProof` objects, which contain intersection IDs and counts of common followings between the user and the candidate.
