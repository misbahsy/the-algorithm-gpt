The `RealGraphOonV2Source` class is a candidate source for the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm. It is responsible for providing a list of candidate users that a given user may want to follow. 

The class extends the `CandidateSource` trait, which requires the implementation of the `apply` method. This method takes a `HasParams with HasClientContext` object as input and returns a `Stitch[Seq[CandidateUser]]`. The `HasParams` trait provides access to request parameters, while the `HasClientContext` trait provides access to client context information. 

The `apply` method first checks if the request contains a user ID. If it does, it uses the `realGraphClientColumn` to fetch the user's real graph. The real graph is a graph of users that the given user has interacted with on Twitter. The method then parses the results and returns a list of `CandidateUser` objects. 

The `parseStratoResults` method is a helper method that takes a `CandidateSeq` object and returns a list of `CandidateUser` objects. It filters the candidates based on a score threshold and creates a `CandidateUser` object for each candidate that passes the threshold. 

The `RealGraphOonV2Source` object defines a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` for the class. This identifier is used to uniquely identify the candidate source in the larger follow recommendations algorithm. 

Overall, the `RealGraphOonV2Source` class is an important component of the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm. It provides a list of candidate users based on a user's real graph, which is a key factor in determining who a user may want to follow. 

Example usage:

```scala
val realGraphClientColumn: UserRealgraphOonV2ClientColumn = ???
val source = new RealGraphOonV2Source(realGraphClientColumn)

val request: HasParams with HasClientContext = ???
val candidates: Stitch[Seq[CandidateUser]] = source.apply(request)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm, which retrieves a list of recommended users for a given user based on their interactions with other users on the platform.

2. What dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries and services, including the Twitter Product Mixer, Hermit, Stitch, and Strato.

3. How are the returned candidates sorted and limited?
- The returned candidates are sorted by score in descending order, and the number of candidates returned is limited by the value of the `MaxResults` parameter in the request.
