The `PreviouslyRecommendedUserIdsPredicate` class is a part of the Twitter Follow Recommendations project and is used to filter out users who have already been recommended to a target user. This class implements the `Predicate` trait and takes a tuple of `HasPreviousRecommendationsContext` and `CandidateUser` as input. The `HasPreviousRecommendationsContext` trait provides access to the previously recommended user IDs for a target user, while the `CandidateUser` class represents a user who is being considered for recommendation.

The `apply` method of this class takes the input tuple and extracts the `targetUser` and `candidate` objects from it. It then retrieves the previously recommended user IDs for the `targetUser` and checks if the `candidate` ID is present in that set. If the `candidate` ID is not present, the method returns a `ValidStitch` object, indicating that the `candidate` is a valid recommendation. If the `candidate` ID is already present in the set of previously recommended user IDs, the method returns an `AlreadyRecommendedStitch` object, indicating that the `candidate` has already been recommended to the `targetUser`.

The `ValidStitch` and `AlreadyRecommendedStitch` objects are created using the `Stitch.value` method, which creates a `Stitch` object with a pre-defined value. The `ValidStitch` object has a value of `PredicateResult.Valid`, which indicates that the `candidate` is a valid recommendation. The `AlreadyRecommendedStitch` object has a value of `PredicateResult.Invalid` and includes a `Set` of `FilterReason.AlreadyRecommended`, indicating that the `candidate` has already been recommended to the `targetUser`.

This class is used in the larger project to filter out previously recommended users from the list of potential recommendations for a target user. This helps to ensure that the recommendations provided to the user are fresh and relevant. An example usage of this class is shown below:

```
val targetUser: HasPreviousRecommendationsContext = // get target user
val candidates: List[CandidateUser] = // get list of candidate users

val validCandidates: List[CandidateUser] = candidates.filter { candidate =>
  PreviouslyRecommendedUserIdsPredicate((targetUser, candidate)).await() match {
    case PredicateResult.Valid => true
    case PredicateResult.Invalid(reasons) => false
  }
}
```

In this example, the `PreviouslyRecommendedUserIdsPredicate` is used to filter out any candidates that have already been recommended to the `targetUser`. The `filter` method is used to apply the predicate to each candidate in the list of `candidates`, and only those candidates that pass the predicate are included in the `validCandidates` list.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a predicate for a follow recommendation system on Twitter. It checks whether a candidate user has already been recommended to a target user based on their previous recommendations.

2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?
- The input is a tuple of a `HasPreviousRecommendationsContext` object and a `CandidateUser` object. The output is a `Stitch` object that contains a `PredicateResult` indicating whether the candidate user is valid or has already been recommended.

3. What is the significance of the `Singleton` annotation and how does it affect the behavior of the class?
- The `Singleton` annotation indicates that there should only be one instance of this class created and shared across the entire application. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage, but it also means that any state stored in the class will be shared across all instances that use it.
