The code above defines a trait called `HasRecentFollowedByUserIds`. A trait is similar to an interface in Java, and it defines a set of methods that a class can implement. In this case, the trait has only one method called `recentFollowedByUserIds`, which returns an optional sequence of `Long` values. The sequence represents the user IDs of users who have recently followed the target user.

The purpose of this trait is to provide a way for other classes in the project to access information about users who have recently followed a target user. This information can be used to make recommendations for other users to follow based on the behavior of similar users.

The trait also defines a lazy value called `numRecentFollowedByUserIds`, which calculates the number of recent followers for the target user. The `lazy` keyword means that the value is only calculated when it is first accessed, and then cached for future use. If the `recentFollowedByUserIds` method returns `None`, indicating that there are no recent followers, then the value of `numRecentFollowedByUserIds` is set to 0.

Here is an example of how this trait might be used in a class that represents a Twitter user:

```scala
package com.twitter.follow_recommendations.recommender

import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.HasRecentFollowedByUserIds

class User(val id: Long) extends HasRecentFollowedByUserIds {
  // implementation of recentFollowedByUserIds method
  def recentFollowedByUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = {
    // code to retrieve recent followers from database or API
    // returns Some(Seq(123, 456, 789)) if there are recent followers
    // returns None if there are no recent followers
  }
}

object Recommender {
  def recommendUsersToFollow(user: User): Seq[User] = {
    val recentFollowers = user.recentFollowedByUserIds.getOrElse(Seq.empty)
    // code to recommend other users to follow based on recent followers
    // returns a sequence of User objects
  }
}
```

In this example, the `User` class extends the `HasRecentFollowedByUserIds` trait and provides an implementation of the `recentFollowedByUserIds` method. The `Recommender` object uses this method to get a sequence of recent followers for a given user, and then uses that information to recommend other users to follow.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this trait and how is it used in the project?
   - This trait defines a method for retrieving a sequence of user ids that have recently followed a target user. It is likely used in recommendation algorithms to suggest new users for the target user to follow.
2. What is the significance of the lazy val `numRecentFollowedByUserIds`?
   - This value calculates the number of recent followers for the target user and is only evaluated when it is accessed for the first time. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations if the value is not needed.
3. What is the expected data type for the `recentFollowedByUserIds` method?
   - The method returns an optional sequence of Long values representing user ids. If there are no recent followers, it returns None.
