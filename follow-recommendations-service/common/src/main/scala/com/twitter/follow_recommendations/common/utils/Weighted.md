The code defines a typeclass called "Weighted" that is used for any recommendation type that has a weight. A typeclass is a way of defining a set of behaviors that can be applied to different types. In this case, the Weighted typeclass defines a behavior for recommendation types that have a weight.

The Weighted typeclass has one method called "apply" that takes a recommendation of type Rec and returns a Double representing the weight of the recommendation. The type parameter Rec is contravariant, meaning that if a type A is a subtype of type B, then Weighted[B] is a subtype of Weighted[A]. This allows for more flexibility in defining the Weighted typeclass for different types of recommendations.

The code also defines an object called Weighted that provides an implementation of the Weighted typeclass for tuples of type (_, Double). This implementation simply returns the second element of the tuple, which is assumed to be the weight.

Additionally, the code provides a factory method called "fromFunction" that takes a function from Rec to Double and returns a new instance of the Weighted typeclass. This allows for custom implementations of the Weighted typeclass for different types of recommendations.

Overall, this code provides a way to define a common behavior for recommendation types that have a weight. This can be useful in a larger project that involves recommending items to users based on their preferences or behavior. For example, if a user has a history of liking certain types of movies, the Weighted typeclass could be used to assign weights to different movie recommendations based on how closely they match the user's preferences.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Weighted trait and how is it used in the project?
- The Weighted trait is a typeclass for any Recommendation type that has a weight. It is used to define a common interface for different types of recommendations that have a weight.

2. What is the purpose of the WeightedTuple object and how is it used in the project?
- The WeightedTuple object is an implicit implementation of the Weighted trait for tuples of any type and a Double. It is used to provide a default implementation for tuples that have a weight as the second element.

3. How is the fromFunction method used to create a Weighted instance?
- The fromFunction method is a factory method that takes a function from a recommendation type to a Double and returns a new instance of the Weighted trait. This allows developers to create custom implementations of the Weighted trait for their specific recommendation types.
