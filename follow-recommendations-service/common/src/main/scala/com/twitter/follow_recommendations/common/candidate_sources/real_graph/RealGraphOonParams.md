This code defines a set of parameters related to candidate sources for a recommendation algorithm that uses a real graph. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure the behavior of the recommendation algorithm by setting values for these parameters. 

The `RealGraphOonParams` object contains several case objects, each of which extends either `FSParam` or `FSBoundedParam`. These are classes that define parameters that can be set to configure the behavior of the recommendation algorithm. 

For example, the `IncludeRealGraphOonCandidates` parameter is a boolean value that determines whether or not to include candidates from the real graph in the recommendation algorithm. The `TryToReadRealGraphOonCandidates` parameter is another boolean value that determines whether or not to attempt to read candidates from the real graph. 

Other parameters include `RealGraphOonResultCountThreshold`, which sets a threshold for the number of results returned by the algorithm, `UseV2`, which is a boolean value that determines whether or not to use a version 2 algorithm, `ScoreThreshold`, which sets a threshold for the score of a recommendation, and `MaxResults`, which sets a maximum number of results to return. 

These parameters can be set to different values depending on the needs of the recommendation algorithm. For example, if the algorithm needs to return a large number of results, the `MaxResults` parameter can be set to a higher value. If the algorithm needs to be more selective in its recommendations, the `ScoreThreshold` parameter can be set to a higher value. 

Overall, this code provides a way to configure the behavior of a recommendation algorithm that uses a real graph. By setting values for these parameters, the algorithm can be customized to meet the needs of a particular use case. 

Example usage:

```
RealGraphOonParams.IncludeRealGraphOonCandidates.set(true)
RealGraphOonParams.ScoreThreshold.set(0.5)
RealGraphOonParams.MaxResults.set(500)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a set of parameters related to candidate sources for a real graph in the context of Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm.

2. What are the default values for the parameters defined in this code?
- The default values for the parameters are: `real_graph_oon_include_candidates` is `false`, `real_graph_oon_try_to_read_candidates` is `false`, `real_graph_oon_result_count_threshold` is `1`, `real_graph_oon_use_v2` is `false`, `real_graph_oon_score_threshold` is `0.26`, and `real_graph_oon_max_results` is `200`.

3. What is the range of values allowed for the `ScoreThreshold` and `MaxResults` parameters?
- The `ScoreThreshold` parameter has a range of `0` to `1.0`, while the `MaxResults` parameter has a range of `0` to `1000`.
