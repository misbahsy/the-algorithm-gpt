The `UserLocationFetcher` class is responsible for fetching the geohash and country code of a user based on their user ID or IP address. This class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is located in the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.geoduck` package.

The class is a singleton and is injected with three dependencies: `LocationServiceClient`, `ReverseGeocodeClient`, and `StatsReceiver`. The `LocationServiceClient` is responsible for fetching the geohash and country code of a user based on their user ID, while the `ReverseGeocodeClient` is responsible for fetching the geohash and country code of a user based on their IP address. The `StatsReceiver` is used to collect statistics about the number of requests made, empty responses received, and exceptions encountered.

The `getGeohashAndCountryCode` method takes two optional parameters: `userId` and `ipAddress`. If `userId` is provided, the method uses the `LocationServiceClient` to fetch the geohash and country code of the user. If `ipAddress` is provided, the method uses the `ReverseGeocodeClient` to fetch the geohash and country code of the user. If both `userId` and `ipAddress` are provided, the method fetches the geohash and country code from both sources and returns the result that has the highest priority.

The method returns a `Stitch` object that represents a computation that may fail. The computation is performed in two steps: first, the geohash and country code are fetched from both sources using `Stitch.collect`. If an exception is encountered during the computation, the appropriate counter is incremented and `Stitch.None` is returned. Second, the results from both sources are combined using `Stitch.join` and the highest priority result is returned. If both sources return empty results, the empty response counter is incremented and `None` is returned.

Here's an example of how to use the `UserLocationFetcher` class:

```scala
val userLocationFetcher = new UserLocationFetcher(locationServiceClient, reverseGeocodeClient, statsReceiver)

val userId: Option[Long] = Some(12345)
val ipAddress: Option[String] = Some("127.0.0.1")

val result: Option[GeohashAndCountryCode] = userLocationFetcher.getGeohashAndCountryCode(userId, ipAddress).run()
``` 

In this example, the `getGeohashAndCountryCode` method is called with a user ID and an IP address. The `run` method is called on the resulting `Stitch` object to execute the computation and return the result. The result is an optional `GeohashAndCountryCode` object that contains the geohash and country code of the user. If the computation fails or returns an empty result, `None` is returned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a singleton class called `UserLocationFetcher` that fetches the geohash and country code of a user based on their user ID or IP address using two different clients.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver` library, as well as two other classes from the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.geoduck` package and the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.GeohashAndCountryCode` model.

3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?
- This code tracks several metrics related to the success and failure of the location service and reverse geocode clients, including the number of requests made, empty responses received, and exceptions encountered. These metrics are stored in a `StatsReceiver` object and are used to increment counters in the `UserLocationFetcher` class.
