The `InterleaveRanker` class is a ranker that interleaves the results of multiple rankers to produce a final ranking of candidates. It takes in a target and a sequence of candidate users and returns a sequence of candidate users sorted by their scores. The ranker uses the scores of the candidates generated by previous rankers to produce the final ranking. 

The `rank` method takes in a target and a sequence of candidate users and returns a `Stitch` of the sequence of candidate users sorted by their scores. The `rankCandidates` method is called by the `rank` method and takes in a target and a sequence of candidate users and returns a sequence of candidate users sorted by their scores. 

The `interleaveCandidates` method is called by the `rankCandidates` method and takes in a sequence of candidate users and a sequence of ranker IDs. It returns a sequence of candidate users sorted by their scores. The method interleaves the candidate users based on their scores and the ranker IDs. The method first sorts all candidates using a ranker and then only holds those candidates whose selected ranker is this ranker. These ranks will be forced in the final ordering. The method then separates candidates into two groups: (1) Production and (2) Experiment. It resolves conflicts between the enforced ranks of experimental models. It retrieves non-occupied positions and assigns them to candidates who use production ranker. It merges the two groups and sorts them by their corresponding positions. 

The `getCandidateScoreByRankerId` method is called by the `interleaveCandidates` method and takes in a candidate user and a ranker ID. It returns the score of the candidate user for the given ranker ID. 

The class uses Guice for dependency injection and Google Guava for annotations. It also uses Twitter's Finagle library for stats reporting and Twitter's Stitch library for asynchronous programming. 

Overall, the `InterleaveRanker` class is an important component of the larger project as it provides a way to combine the results of multiple rankers to produce a final ranking of candidates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a ranker for a follow recommendation system on Twitter. It takes in a target user and a list of candidate users, and ranks the candidates based on their scores from previous rankers. It is one component of the larger follow recommendation system.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they used?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries and modules, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Stitch. These dependencies are used to provide functionality such as dependency injection, statistics tracking, and asynchronous programming.

3. How does the rankCandidates method work and what is its output?
- The rankCandidates method takes in a target user and a list of candidate users, and filters out any candidates that do not meet certain criteria. It then interleaves the remaining candidates based on their scores from previous rankers, and resolves any conflicts between candidates with the same score. The output of this method is a sequence of candidate users, sorted by their final position in the interleaved ranking.
