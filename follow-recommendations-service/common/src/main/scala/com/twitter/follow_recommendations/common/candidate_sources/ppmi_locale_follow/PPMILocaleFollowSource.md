The `PPMILocaleFollowSource` class is a candidate source that fetches candidates based on the Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) statistic for a set of locales. It is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a list of recommended users to follow based on the user's preferred locales. It uses the PPMI statistic to calculate the similarity between users based on their preferred locales. The higher the PPMI score, the more similar the users are. 

The `PPMILocaleFollowSource` class implements the `CandidateSource` interface, which requires the implementation of the `apply` method. The `apply` method takes a `target` parameter of type `HasClientContext with HasParams` and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[CandidateUser]`. The `target` parameter contains the user's country code and user ID. The `getPreferredLocales` method is called to fetch the user's preferred locales based on their user ID and country code. The `getPPMILocaleFollowCandidates` method is then called to fetch the PPMI candidates for each locale. The `PPMILocaleFollowSource` class then returns a list of recommended users sorted by their PPMI score. 

The `PPMILocaleFollowSource` class has two private methods: `getPPMILocaleFollowCandidates` and `getPreferredLocales`. The `getPPMILocaleFollowCandidates` method takes a sequence of locales and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[CandidateUser]`. It fetches the PPMI candidates for each locale and returns a list of `CandidateUser` objects. The `getPreferredLocales` method takes a user ID and country code and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[String]`. It fetches the user's preferred locales based on their user ID and country code. 

The `PPMILocaleFollowSource` class has two companion object variables: `Identifier` and `DefaultMaxCandidatesToReturn`. The `Identifier` variable is a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` object that identifies the candidate source as `Algorithm.PPMILocaleFollow`. The `DefaultMaxCandidatesToReturn` variable is an integer that specifies the maximum number of candidates to return. 

Here is an example of how to use the `PPMILocaleFollowSource` class:

```
val ppmiLocaleFollowSource = new PPMILocaleFollowSource(
  userPreferredLanguagesOnUserClientColumn,
  localeFollowPpmiClientColumn,
  statsReceiver
)

val target = new HasClientContext with HasParams {
  override def getCountryCode: Option[String] = Some("US")
  override def getOptionalUserId: Option[Long] = Some(1234567890)
  override def params: Map[String, Any] = Map(
    CandidateSourceEnabled -> true,
    LocaleToExcludeFromRecommendation -> Seq("en", "fr")
  )
}

val candidates = ppmiLocaleFollowSource.apply(target).get
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a candidate source for fetching Twitter users based on the Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) statistic for a set of locales.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several Twitter libraries, including Finagle, Hermit, Product Mixer, and Stitch. It also uses the Strato generated client for fetching user preferred languages and locale follow PPMI.

3. What is the default maximum number of candidates to return?
- The default maximum number of candidates to return is 100, as specified by the `DefaultMaxCandidatesToReturn` constant in the `PPMILocaleFollowSource` object.
