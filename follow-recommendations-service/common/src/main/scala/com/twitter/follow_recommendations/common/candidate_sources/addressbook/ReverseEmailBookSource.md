The `ReverseEmailBookSource` class is a candidate source for generating a list of recommended users to follow on Twitter. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The purpose of this class is to generate a list of candidates for a target user based on their email contacts. It takes in a `target` object that contains user information and returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. 

To generate the list of candidates, the class uses the `EmailStorageServiceClient` and `AddressbookClient` to retrieve the user's verified email and email contacts, respectively. It then uses the `RecordIdentifier` class to create a sequence of identifiers for each email contact. These identifiers are used to retrieve the corresponding users from the `AddressbookClient`. 

The retrieved users are then mapped to `CandidateUser` objects with a default score and the identifier of the `ReverseEmailBookSource` class. The resulting list of candidates is limited to a maximum of 500 entries and returned in the `Stitch` object.

This class can be used as a part of a larger recommendation system to suggest users for a target user to follow on Twitter. It is specifically designed to use email contacts as a source of recommendations. Other candidate sources may use different sources of information, such as user behavior or interests, to generate recommendations. 

Example usage:

```
val reverseEmailBookSource = new ReverseEmailBookSource(
  reverseEmailContactsClientColumn,
  essClient,
  addressBookClient,
  statsReceiver)

val target = new HasParams with HasClientContext {
  override def params: Map[String, Any] = Map("ReadFromABV2Only" -> true)
  override def clientContext: Any = ???
}

val candidates: Seq[CandidateUser] = reverseEmailBookSource.apply(target).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code is a candidate source for generating a list of recommended users for a target user based on their email contacts. It solves the problem of providing personalized recommendations to users based on their existing contacts.

2. What dependencies does this code have? 
- This code has dependencies on various Twitter libraries such as Finagle, Hermit, and Stitch, as well as other custom libraries for handling email storage and address book clients.

3. What is the significance of the ReverseEmailBookSource object? 
- The ReverseEmailBookSource object contains constants such as the identifier for the candidate source, the number of email book entries to retrieve, and the default edge type. These constants are used throughout the code and can be easily modified if needed.
