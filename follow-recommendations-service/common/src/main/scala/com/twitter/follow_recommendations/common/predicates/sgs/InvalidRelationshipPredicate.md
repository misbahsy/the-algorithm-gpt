The `InvalidRelationshipPredicate` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to filter out candidate users who have an invalid relationship with the target user. This class implements the `Predicate` trait and takes a tuple of `HasInvalidRelationshipUserIds` and `CandidateUser` as input. The `HasInvalidRelationshipUserIds` trait is used to identify users who have an invalid relationship with the target user, and the `CandidateUser` class represents a user who is a candidate for recommendation.

The `apply` method of the `InvalidRelationshipPredicate` class takes the input tuple and returns a `Stitch` object that represents the result of the predicate evaluation. If the `invalidRelationshipUserIds` field of the `targetUser` object contains the `id` of the `candidate` user, the `InvalidRelationshipPredicate.InvalidRelationshipStitch` object is returned, which represents that the candidate user has an invalid relationship with the target user. Otherwise, the `InvalidRelationshipPredicate.ValidStitch` object is returned, which represents that the candidate user has a valid relationship with the target user.

The `InvalidRelationshipPredicate` class also contains two companion objects. The first object defines the `ValidStitch` object, which represents a valid predicate result. The second object defines the `InvalidRelationshipStitch` object, which represents an invalid predicate result with the reason for the invalid relationship being `FilterReason.InvalidRelationship`.

This class can be used in the larger project to filter out candidate users who have an invalid relationship with the target user. For example, the `InvalidRelationshipPredicate` class can be used in conjunction with other predicates to generate a list of recommended users for the target user. The list of recommended users can be generated by applying the predicates to a list of candidate users and selecting the users that pass all the predicates.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
   - This code defines a predicate called `InvalidRelationshipPredicate` that checks if a candidate user has an invalid relationship with a target user. It is used as part of a recommendation system to filter out certain candidates.
2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
   - This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `Predicate`, `PredicateResult`, `CandidateUser`, `FilterReason`, and `Stitch`. It also uses the `HasInvalidRelationshipUserIds` trait.
3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` annotation on the class definition?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the `InvalidRelationshipPredicate` class should be created and shared across the entire application. This can help improve performance and reduce memory usage.
