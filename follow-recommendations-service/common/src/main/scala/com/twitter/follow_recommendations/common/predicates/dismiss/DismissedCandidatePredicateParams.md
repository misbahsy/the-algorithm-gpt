This code defines a set of parameters for a predicate that is used to dismiss candidate recommendations for Twitter users to follow. The `DismissedCandidatePredicateParams` object contains a single case object called `LookBackDuration`, which is a parameter that specifies the duration of time to look back when determining whether a candidate should be dismissed. 

The `LookBackDuration` parameter is defined using the `Param` class from the `com.twitter.timelines.configapi` package, which allows for the specification of default values and type checking. In this case, the default value for `LookBackDuration` is set to 180 days, which is converted to a `Duration` object using the `DurationOps` implicit conversion from the `com.twitter.conversions` package.

This code is likely used in conjunction with other code that implements the actual predicate logic for dismissing candidate recommendations. The `LookBackDuration` parameter allows for customization of the time frame used in the dismissal logic, which could be useful for testing and tuning the algorithm. 

Here is an example of how this parameter might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.predicates.dismiss.DismissedCandidatePredicateParams.LookBackDuration

val lookBackDuration: Duration = LookBackDuration()
// use lookBackDuration in dismissal logic
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? 
- This code defines a parameter for the duration of a lookback period used in a dismissed candidate predicate. It is likely used in a recommendation system to filter out previously dismissed candidates. 

2. What is the significance of the `Param` and `Duration` classes being imported? 
- The `Param` class is likely used to define parameters for the recommendation system, while the `Duration` class is used to represent a length of time. The `DurationOps` conversion is likely used to make working with durations more convenient. 

3. Why is the default lookback duration set to 180 days? 
- Without more context, it's unclear why this specific duration was chosen. It could be based on historical data or determined through experimentation.
