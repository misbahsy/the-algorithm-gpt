The code defines a case class called UserCandidateSourceDetails, which represents the details of a candidate source responsible for generating a user candidate. The primaryCandidateSource parameter is an optional identifier for the candidate source that generated the candidate. The candidateSourceScores parameter is a map of candidate sources and their corresponding scores. The candidateSourceRanks parameter is a map of candidate sources and their corresponding ranks. The addressBookMetadata parameter is an optional metadata associated with the candidate source. The candidateSourceFeatures parameter is a map of candidate sources and their corresponding features.

The toThrift method converts the UserCandidateSourceDetails object to a Thrift object of type t.CandidateSourceDetails. The candidateSourceScores and primarySource fields are populated based on the values of the corresponding fields in the UserCandidateSourceDetails object.

The toOfflineThrift method converts the UserCandidateSourceDetails object to a Thrift object of type offline.CandidateSourceDetails. The candidateSourceScores and primarySource fields are populated based on the values of the corresponding fields in the UserCandidateSourceDetails object.

The UserCandidateSourceDetails object can be created from a Thrift object of type t.CandidateSourceDetails using the fromThrift method. The primaryCandidateSource, candidateSourceScores, and candidateSourceRanks fields are populated based on the values of the corresponding fields in the Thrift object. The addressBookMetadata and candidateSourceFeatures fields are set to None and an empty map, respectively.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves generating user recommendations based on various candidate sources. The UserCandidateSourceDetails object provides information about the candidate sources responsible for generating a user candidate, which can be used to rank and score the candidates. The Thrift conversion methods allow the UserCandidateSourceDetails object to be passed between different components of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` class?
- The `UserCandidateSourceDetails` class is used to store information about a candidate source that is responsible for generating a candidate, including its scores, ranks, and features.

2. What is the difference between the `toThrift` and `toOfflineThrift` methods?
- The `toThrift` and `toOfflineThrift` methods both convert the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object to a Thrift object, but the former is used for online processing while the latter is used for offline processing.

3. What is the `fromThrift` method used for?
- The `fromThrift` method is used to parse the candidate source of the candidates passed from the `scoreUserCandidates` endpoint and convert them to `UserCandidateSourceDetails` objects.
