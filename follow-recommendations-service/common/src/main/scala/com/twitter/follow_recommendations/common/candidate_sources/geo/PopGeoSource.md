The code defines two classes, `BasePopGeoSource` and `PopGeoSource`, both of which are used to generate a list of recommended Twitter accounts to follow based on geographic location. 

`BasePopGeoSource` is a singleton class that extends `StratoFetcherWithUnitViewSource`. It takes a `Fetcher` object as a parameter, which is used to fetch a list of popular Twitter users in a given geographic location. The `map` method is overridden to map the fetched data to a list of `CandidateUser` objects. The `map` method sorts the list of users by their popularity score and returns the top 200 users as `CandidateUser` objects. 

`PopGeoSource` is also a singleton class that extends `CachedCandidateSource`. It takes a `BasePopGeoSource` object and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. The `CachedCandidateSource` caches the results of the `BasePopGeoSource` object and returns the cached results if they are available. The `PopGeoSource` class also defines a `MaxCacheSize` and a `CacheTTL` value, which determine the maximum number of cached results and the time-to-live of the cached results, respectively. 

Together, these classes provide a way to generate a list of recommended Twitter accounts to follow based on geographic location. The `BasePopGeoSource` class fetches a list of popular Twitter users in a given location, and the `PopGeoSource` class caches and returns the top 200 users from that list. This list of users can be used to generate recommendations for Twitter users to follow based on their location. 

Example usage:

```
val popGeoSource = new PopGeoSource(basePopGeoSource, statsReceiver)
val recommendations = popGeoSource.getRecommendations("San Francisco")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines classes and methods for fetching and caching popular Twitter users in a specific geographic location.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Util.

3. How are candidate users selected and mapped in this code?
- Candidate users are selected based on their popularity score in a specific geographic location, and are mapped to a `CandidateUser` object with an associated `Reason` object that includes a `PopularInGeoProof` location.
