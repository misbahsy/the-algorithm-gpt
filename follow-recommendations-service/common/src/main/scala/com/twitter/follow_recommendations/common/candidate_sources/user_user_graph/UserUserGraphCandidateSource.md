The `UserUserGraphCandidateSource` class is a candidate source for the Twitter recommendation system. It is responsible for generating a list of recommended users for a given user based on their social graph. The class implements the `CandidateSource` trait, which requires the implementation of the `apply` method. The `apply` method takes a `Target` object as input and returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects.

The `Target` object is a combination of several traits that provide the necessary information to generate recommendations. These traits include `HasParams`, `HasClientContext`, `HasRecentFollowedUserIds`, and `HasExcludedUserIds`. The `HasParams` trait provides access to the configuration parameters for the recommendation system. The `HasClientContext` trait provides access to the client context, which includes information about the user making the request. The `HasRecentFollowedUserIds` trait provides access to the list of users that the target user has recently followed. The `HasExcludedUserIds` trait provides access to the list of users that should be excluded from the recommendations.

The `apply` method first checks if the candidate source is enabled in the weight map. If it is enabled, it builds a `RecommendUserRequest` object using the `buildRecommendUserRequest` method. The `RecommendUserRequest` object contains the necessary information to generate recommendations, including the user ID, the display location, the list of recent followed users, and the list of excluded users. It also specifies the maximum number of results to return and the type of social proof to use.

The `buildRecommendUserRequest` method takes the `Target` object as input and returns an optional `RecommendUserRequest` object. It first checks if the user ID and recent followed user IDs are available. If they are, it creates a map of seeds with weights using the recent followed user IDs. It then creates a `RecommendUserRequest` object with the necessary parameters and returns it.

The `apply` method then uses the `fetcher` object to fetch the recommendations using the `RecommendUserRequest` object. It then maps the response to a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects using the `convertToCandidateUsers` method. The `convertToCandidateUsers` method takes a `RecommendedUser` object as input and returns a `CandidateUser` object. It extracts the user ID, score, and social proof information from the `RecommendedUser` object and creates a `CandidateUser` object with the necessary parameters.

Overall, the `UserUserGraphCandidateSource` class is an important component of the Twitter recommendation system. It generates recommendations based on the user's social graph and provides a list of recommended users to follow. The class can be used in conjunction with other candidate sources to generate a comprehensive list of recommendations for the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a candidate source for a recommendation algorithm called The Algorithm from Twitter. It retrieves a list of recommended users based on a user's recent followed users and social proof.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on various libraries such as Finagle, Hermit, and Stitch, as well as other classes and constants within the project.

3. What is the logic behind the sorting and mapping of recommended users in the `apply` method?
- The recommended users are sorted by score in descending order, then mapped to `CandidateUser` objects with the identifier of the `UserUserGraphCandidateSource`. These `CandidateUser` objects are then returned as a sequence within a `Stitch` object.
