The code above defines a configuration class called `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSourceFSConfig` that extends the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class. This class is used to manage feature switches for the `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` candidate source in the social graph module of the larger project.

The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` is a recommendation algorithm that suggests Twitter accounts to follow based on the accounts that a user has recently followed and the accounts that those accounts follow. This algorithm is designed to improve the relevance of follow recommendations by taking into account the user's recent activity and the activity of their network.

The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSourceFSConfig` class defines a single boolean feature switch parameter called `CallSgsCachedColumn`. This parameter is used to control whether or not the algorithm should use a cached column in the social graph store when making recommendations. If the parameter is set to `true`, the algorithm will use the cached column, otherwise it will not.

The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSourceFSConfig` class is annotated with `@Singleton` to ensure that only one instance of the class is created and used throughout the application. The class is also annotated with `@Inject` to indicate that it can be injected into other classes that depend on it.

Overall, this code plays an important role in managing the feature switches for the `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` candidate source in the social graph module of the larger project. By allowing developers to control the behavior of the algorithm through feature switches, the project can be more easily customized and optimized for different use cases. 

Example usage:

```scala
val config = new RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSourceFSConfig()
val useCachedColumn = config.booleanFSParams.exists(_.name == "CallSgsCachedColumn") && config.booleanFSParams.find(_.name == "CallSgsCachedColumn").get.value
val candidateSource = new RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource(useCachedColumn)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a configuration file for a feature switch related to candidate sources in a social graph. It defines a boolean parameter for a specific expansion source.

2. What other classes or files does this code interact with?
   - This code interacts with the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class and imports classes from `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.common` and `com.twitter.timelines.configapi`.

3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection, indicating that this class can be injected with other dependencies.
