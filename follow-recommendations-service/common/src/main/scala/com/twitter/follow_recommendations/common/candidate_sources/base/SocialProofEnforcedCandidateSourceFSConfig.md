The code defines a configuration class called SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSourceFSConfig that extends the FeatureSwitchConfig class. This class is responsible for managing the feature switches for the SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource candidate source in the larger project. 

The SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSourceFSConfig class has several overridden methods that define the boolean, integer, and duration feature switch parameters for the candidate source. These parameters include MustCallSgs, CallSgsCachedColumn, QueryIntersectionIdsNum, MaxNumCandidatesToAnnotate, GfsIntersectionIdsNum, SgsIntersectionIdsNum, and GfsLagDurationInDays. 

The boolean parameters are used to enable or disable certain features of the candidate source, while the integer parameters define numerical limits for certain operations. The duration parameter specifies the duration of a lag period for a certain operation. 

The SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSourceFSConfig class is annotated with @Singleton and @Inject, indicating that it is a singleton class that can be injected into other classes in the project. This allows other classes to access the feature switch parameters defined in this class and use them to configure the behavior of the SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource candidate source. 

For example, a class that uses the SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource candidate source could inject an instance of the SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSourceFSConfig class and use its feature switch parameters to customize the behavior of the candidate source. 

Overall, the SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSourceFSConfig class plays an important role in managing the feature switches for the SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource candidate source in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
