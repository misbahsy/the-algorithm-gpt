The code above defines a Scala object called Utils that contains helper functions for FeatureStoreSource operations in FRS. The object imports two external libraries, com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver and com.twitter.ml.api, which are used to implement the helper functions.

The first helper function, adaptAdditionalFeaturesToDataRecord, takes in three parameters: a DataRecord object, a StatsReceiver object, and a sequence of IRecordOneToOneAdapter objects. The function iterates through the sequence of adapters and applies each adapter to the DataRecord object. The StatsReceiver object is used to keep track of the number of times each adapter is applied. The function returns the modified DataRecord object.

The second helper function, randomizedTTL, takes in a single parameter, a Long value representing a time-to-live (TTL) value. The function applies a random factor to the TTL value to avoid a cache stampede, which occurs when a large number of requests are made for a resource that is not currently in the cache. The function multiplies the TTL value by a constant value (EarlyExpiration) and a random double value between 0 and 1. The result is then converted to a Long value and returned.

These helper functions are used in the larger FRS project to modify DataRecord objects and calculate TTL values for cached resources. For example, the adaptAdditionalFeaturesToDataRecord function may be used to add additional features to a DataRecord object before it is used in a machine learning algorithm. The randomizedTTL function may be used to calculate a TTL value for a cached resource to avoid a cache stampede. Overall, these helper functions improve the efficiency and accuracy of the FRS project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides helper functions for FeatureStoreSource operations in FRS.
- It includes a function to adapt additional features to a data record and a function to randomize time-to-live (TTL) to avoid cache stampede.

2. What is the significance of the EarlyExpiration constant and how is it used?
- EarlyExpiration is a constant with a value of 0.2.
- It is used in the randomizedTTL function to reduce the TTL by a random factor between 0 and 0.2 to avoid cache stampede.

3. What is the role of the StatsReceiver object and how is it used in this code?
- The StatsReceiver object is used to collect statistics on the performance of the feature adapters.
- It is used in the adaptAdditionalFeaturesToDataRecord function to increment a counter for each adapter that is applied to the data record.
