The code above is a Scala class called `RecentEngagementSimilarUsersFSConfig` that extends the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class. This class is responsible for managing feature switches for the recent engagement similar users candidate source in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The `RecentEngagementSimilarUsersFSConfig` class has a single method called `booleanFSParams` that returns a sequence of `FSParam[Boolean]` objects. These objects are defined in the `RecentEngagementSimilarUsersParams` object and contain boolean values that control the behavior of the recent engagement similar users candidate source.

The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for managing feature switches related to the recent engagement similar users candidate source. By extending the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class, this class inherits the ability to read feature switch values from a configuration file or other data source.

This class is used in the larger project by injecting an instance of it into other classes that need to read feature switch values for the recent engagement similar users candidate source. For example, a class that generates candidate recommendations might use this class to determine whether to enable or disable a particular feature.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
class CandidateGenerator @Inject() (fsConfig: RecentEngagementSimilarUsersFSConfig) {
  def generateCandidates(userId: Long): Seq[Candidate] = {
    val firstDegreeSortEnabled = fsConfig.booleanFSParams
      .find(_.name == "first_degree_sort_enabled")
      .map(_.value)
      .getOrElse(false)

    // Use the value of firstDegreeSortEnabled to generate candidates
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, the `CandidateGenerator` class takes an instance of `RecentEngagementSimilarUsersFSConfig` as a constructor parameter. The `generateCandidates` method uses the `booleanFSParams` method to read the value of the `first_degree_sort_enabled` feature switch and then generates candidate recommendations based on that value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is defining a configuration class for a feature switch related to recent engagement similar users in a candidate source expansion algorithm.

2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
    
    The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.

3. What is the meaning of `booleanFSParams` and `RecentEngagementSimilarUsersParams.FirstDegreeSortEnabled`?
    
    `booleanFSParams` is a sequence of feature switch parameters that are of type boolean. `RecentEngagementSimilarUsersParams.FirstDegreeSortEnabled` is a specific boolean feature switch parameter that is being defined in this configuration class.
