The code defines an object called `FirstNRankerFeatureSwitchKeys` which contains three string values: `CandidatePoolSize`, `ScribeRankingInfo`, and `MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor`. These values are used as keys to access certain features in the `FirstNRanker` class, which is likely a part of a larger project related to Twitter's follow recommendations.

The `CandidatePoolSize` key is likely used to set the size of the pool of candidates that the `FirstNRanker` class will consider when making recommendations. This value may be adjustable based on the needs of the project or the preferences of the user.

The `ScribeRankingInfo` key may be used to enable or disable the logging of ranking information by the `FirstNRanker` class. This information could be used for analysis or debugging purposes.

The `MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor` key may be used to adjust the minimum number of candidates that the `FirstNRanker` class will score. This value may be scaled down based on the size of the candidate pool, in order to avoid unnecessary computation.

Overall, this code provides a way to access and adjust certain features of the `FirstNRanker` class, which is likely a key component of the larger follow recommendations project. Here is an example of how these keys might be used in the project:

```
val ranker = new FirstNRanker()
ranker.setFeatureSwitch(FirstNRankerFeatureSwitchKeys.CandidatePoolSize, "100")
ranker.setFeatureSwitch(FirstNRankerFeatureSwitchKeys.ScribeRankingInfo, "true")
ranker.setFeatureSwitch(FirstNRankerFeatureSwitchKeys.MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor, "0.5")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this object and how is it used in the project?
   - This object defines three keys related to the `FirstNRanker` feature switch, which are likely used to configure or enable/disable certain aspects of the ranker.
2. What is the significance of the `CandidatePoolSize` key?
   - The `CandidatePoolSize` key likely determines the maximum number of candidates that the `FirstNRanker` will consider when making recommendations.
3. How does the `MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor` key affect the ranker's behavior?
   - The `MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor` key likely scales down the minimum number of candidates that the ranker will score, potentially allowing for faster processing or more efficient use of resources.
