The `CollectionUtil` object provides a method called `transposeLazy` that transposes a sequence of sequences. The method takes a sequence of sequences as input and returns a stream of sequences. The sequences in the input sequence can have different lengths. 

The `transposeLazy` method works by first filtering out any empty sequences from the input sequence. It then checks if the filtered sequence is empty. If it is, an empty stream is returned. If it is not, the method creates a stream of the first elements of each sequence in the filtered sequence. It then recursively calls itself with the tail of each sequence in the filtered sequence to create the rest of the transposed stream. 

The purpose of this method is to provide a way to transpose a sequence of sequences with different lengths. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as when working with matrices or tables where the rows and columns may have different lengths. 

Here is an example of how to use the `transposeLazy` method:

```
val seq = Seq(Seq(1,2,3), Seq(4,5), Seq(6,7))
val transposed = CollectionUtil.transposeLazy(seq)
// transposed: Stream[Seq[Int]] = Stream(List(1, 4, 6), ?)

transposed.foreach(println)
// List(1, 4, 6)
// List(2, 5, 7)
// List(3)
```

In this example, we create a sequence of sequences where the first sequence has three elements, the second sequence has two elements, and the third sequence has two elements. We then call the `transposeLazy` method with this sequence and store the result in a variable called `transposed`. We can then iterate over the `transposed` stream and print each sequence to see that the method has correctly transposed the input sequence.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `transposeLazy` method do?
   - The `transposeLazy` method transposes a sequence of sequences, where the sequences do not have to have the same length.
2. What is the input and output of the `transposeLazy` method?
   - The input of the `transposeLazy` method is a sequence of sequences, and the output is a transposed sequence of sequences.
3. How does the `transposeLazy` method handle empty sequences?
   - The `transposeLazy` method filters out empty sequences from the input sequence of sequences and returns an empty stream if there are no non-empty sequences.
