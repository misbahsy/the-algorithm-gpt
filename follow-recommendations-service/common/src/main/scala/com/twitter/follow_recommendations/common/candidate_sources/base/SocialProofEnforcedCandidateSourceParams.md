The code defines a set of parameters for a candidate source algorithm that enforces social proof. Social proof is a concept that suggests people are more likely to follow the actions of others, especially those they perceive as similar or credible. In the context of Twitter, social proof can be used to recommend accounts to follow based on the actions of other users. 

The parameters defined in this code are used to configure the behavior of the candidate source algorithm. For example, the `MustCallSgs` parameter specifies whether the algorithm must call the social graph service (SGS) to retrieve candidate accounts. The `CallSgsCachedColumn` parameter specifies whether the algorithm should use a cached column to retrieve candidate accounts. The `QueryIntersectionIdsNum` parameter specifies the number of intersection IDs to use when querying for candidate accounts. 

Other parameters define limits on the number of candidates to annotate (`MaxNumCandidatesToAnnotate`), the number of intersection IDs to use for GFS and SGS (`GfsIntersectionIdsNum` and `SgsIntersectionIdsNum`, respectively), and the duration of the GFS lag (`GfsLagDurationInDays`). 

These parameters can be used to fine-tune the behavior of the candidate source algorithm and improve the quality of the recommendations it generates. For example, increasing the number of intersection IDs used for querying candidate accounts may result in more relevant recommendations, while limiting the number of candidates to annotate can help reduce processing time and improve performance. 

Overall, this code plays an important role in the larger project by providing a way to configure and optimize the candidate source algorithm for social proof-based recommendations on Twitter. 

Example usage:

```scala
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.candidate_sources.base.SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSourceParams._

// Set the number of intersection IDs to use for querying candidate accounts
QueryIntersectionIdsNum.set(5)

// Get the current value of the GFS lag duration parameter
val gfsLagDuration = GfsLagDurationInDays.get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a set of parameters for a candidate source in a social proof enforcement algorithm.

2. What are some of the configurable parameters and their default values?
- Some of the configurable parameters include the number of query intersection IDs, the maximum number of candidates to annotate, and the GFS lag duration in days. Their default values are provided in the code.

3. What is the significance of the `HasDurationConversion` trait and the `durationConversion` field?
- The `HasDurationConversion` trait indicates that the `GfsLagDurationInDays` parameter can be converted from a duration in days to another unit of time. The `durationConversion` field specifies the conversion method to be used.
