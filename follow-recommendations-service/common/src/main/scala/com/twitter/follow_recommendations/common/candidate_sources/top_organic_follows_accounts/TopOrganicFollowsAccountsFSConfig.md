[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/candidate_sources/top_organic_follows_accounts/TopOrganicFollowsAccountsFSConfig.scala)

The code above defines a configuration class called TopOrganicFollowsAccountsFSConfig that extends the FeatureSwitchConfig class. This class is responsible for managing feature switches and their corresponding parameters for the Top Organic Follows Accounts candidate source. 

The Top Organic Follows Accounts candidate source is a feature that recommends Twitter accounts to follow based on the user's organic interactions with other accounts. This feature is enabled or disabled using the booleanFSParams parameter called CandidateSourceEnabled. The weight of this candidate source in the overall recommendation algorithm is controlled by the doubleFSParams parameter called CandidateSourceWeight. 

The TopOrganicFollowsAccountsFSConfig class is annotated with @Singleton, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire application. This ensures that the feature switch configuration is consistent throughout the application.

This class depends on other classes such as FeatureSwitchConfig, Param, FSBoundedParam, and FSName, which are imported at the beginning of the file. These classes provide the necessary abstractions for defining and managing feature switches and their corresponding parameters.

Here is an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```
val topOrganicFollowsAccountsConfig = new TopOrganicFollowsAccountsFSConfig()
if (topOrganicFollowsAccountsConfig.isEnabled(TopOrganicFollowsAccountsParams.CandidateSourceEnabled)) {
  val candidateSourceWeight = topOrganicFollowsAccountsConfig.getDouble(TopOrganicFollowsAccountsParams.CandidateSourceWeight)
  // Use candidateSourceWeight to calculate the weight of the Top Organic Follows Accounts candidate source in the recommendation algorithm
} else {
  // The Top Organic Follows Accounts candidate source is disabled, do not use it in the recommendation algorithm
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the TopOrganicFollowsAccountsFSConfig class and check if the CandidateSourceEnabled feature switch is enabled. If it is enabled, we retrieve the CandidateSourceWeight parameter value and use it to calculate the weight of the Top Organic Follows Accounts candidate source in the recommendation algorithm. If it is disabled, we do not use this candidate source in the recommendation algorithm.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a configuration file for a feature switch related to candidate sources for follow recommendations. It is likely used in conjunction with other code related to follow recommendations.

2. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection, allowing the class to receive instances of other classes it depends on.

3. What are the `booleanFSParams` and `doubleFSParams` variables and how are they used?
- `booleanFSParams` and `doubleFSParams` are both sequences of parameters related to feature switches. `booleanFSParams` contains boolean parameters with names specified by `FSName`, while `doubleFSParams` contains double parameters with names and bounds specified by `FSBoundedParam`. These parameters are used to control the behavior of the feature switch.
