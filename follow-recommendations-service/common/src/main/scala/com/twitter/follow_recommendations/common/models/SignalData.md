The code defines a trait and a case class that represent signal data related to recent follows on Twitter. The trait `SignalData` defines two properties: `userId` of type `Long` and `signalType` of type `SignalType`. The case class `RecentFollowsSignal` extends `SignalData` and adds two more properties: `followedUserId` of type `Long` and `timestamp` of type `Long`. 

The object `RecentFollowsSignal` provides two methods. The first method, `fromUssSignal`, takes a `targetUserId` of type `Long` and a `signal` of type `Signal` and returns a `RecentFollowsSignal`. The method extracts the `followedUserId` from the `signal` and creates a new `RecentFollowsSignal` object with the extracted `followedUserId`, `targetUserId`, `timestamp`, and `signalType`. 

The second method, `getRecentFollowedUserIds`, takes an optional `signalDataMap` of type `Option[Map[SignalType, Seq[SignalData]]]` and returns an optional sequence of `Long`. The method first maps the `signalDataMap` to a sequence of `SignalData` with the key `SignalType.AccountFollow`. Then, it filters the sequence to only include `RecentFollowsSignal` objects and extracts the `followedUserId` property from each object. The resulting sequence contains the `followedUserId` of all recent follows for the given `signalDataMap`. 

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves analyzing user signals on Twitter. The `SignalData` trait and `RecentFollowsSignal` case class provide a way to represent signal data related to recent follows. The `fromUssSignal` method allows for the creation of a `RecentFollowsSignal` object from a `Signal` object, which is likely obtained from some signal service. The `getRecentFollowedUserIds` method allows for the extraction of the `followedUserId` of recent follows from a `signalDataMap`, which is likely a collection of signals for a particular user. Overall, this code provides a way to work with recent follow signals in a larger Twitter signal analysis project. 

Example usage:
```
val signal = Signal(
  targetInternalId = Some(InternalId.UserId(12345)),
  timestamp = 1625000000,
  signalType = SignalType.AccountFollow
)
val recentFollowsSignal = RecentFollowsSignal.fromUssSignal(67890, signal)
// recentFollowsSignal: RecentFollowsSignal = RecentFollowsSignal(67890,AccountFollow,12345,1625000000)

val signalDataMap: Option[Map[SignalType, Seq[SignalData]]] = Some(Map(
  SignalType.AccountFollow -> Seq(
    RecentFollowsSignal(123, SignalType.AccountFollow, 456, 1625000000),
    RecentFollowsSignal(123, SignalType.AccountFollow, 789, 1624900000),
    Signal(SignalType.Like, 1624800000)
  )
))
val recentFollowedUserIds = RecentFollowsSignal.getRecentFollowedUserIds(signalDataMap)
// recentFollowedUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(List(456, 789))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a trait and a case class for signal data related to recent follows on Twitter, as well as two methods for working with this data.

2. What other dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports two other packages, `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala.InternalId` and `com.twitter.usersignalservice.thriftscala.SignalType`, which are likely used elsewhere in the project.

3. What does the `fromUssSignal` method do?
- The `fromUssSignal` method takes a target user ID and a `Signal` object, extracts the ID of the followed user from the `Signal`'s internal ID field, and returns a `RecentFollowsSignal` object with the relevant data.
