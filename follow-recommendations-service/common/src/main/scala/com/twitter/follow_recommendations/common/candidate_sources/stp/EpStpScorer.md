The `EpStpScorer` class is a machine learning ranker that is used to score records based on a prehistoric machine learning framework. It takes in a `Record` object and returns a `ScoredResponse` object that contains a score and an optional breakdown of the features used to calculate the score. 

The `getScoredResponse` method takes in a `Record` object and a boolean flag `details` that determines whether or not to include the breakdown of features in the response. It creates an `EPScoringOptions` object that specifies whether or not to include the feature breakdown and transformer intermediate records. It then creates an `EPScoringRequest` object with the `Record` object and the `EPScoringOptions` object. 

The `EPScoringRequest` object is then converted to a Thrift object using `BinaryScalaCodec` and `BinaryThriftCodec`. The Thrift object is passed to the `epScorer` object's `score` method, which returns a `Future` of a list of `EPScoringResponse` objects. The `getScore` method is called on the list of `EPScoringResponse` objects to extract the score and normalize it using `ScorerUtil.normalize`. The `ScoredResponse` object is then returned with the score and optional feature breakdown.

The `EpStpScorer` class is used in the larger project to rank records based on a prehistoric machine learning framework. It can be used to score records in real-time and provide a ranked list of records based on their scores. The `ScoredResponse` object can be used to display the score and feature breakdown to the user. 

Example usage:

```
val scorer = new EpStpScorer(epScorer)
val record = Record(...)
val scoredResponse = scorer.getScoredResponse(record, details = true).get()
println(scoredResponse.score)
println(scoredResponse.featuresBreakdown.getOrElse("No feature breakdown available."))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `EpStpScorer` which is an STP ML ranker trained using a prehistoric ML framework. It provides a method called `getScoredResponse` which takes a `Record` and returns a `Stitch` of an optional `ScoredResponse`. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to score records using the prehistoric ML framework.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external libraries including `com.twitter.bijection`, `com.twitter.relevance`, `com.twitter.stitch`, and `javax.inject`. It also uses the `scala.collection.JavaConverters` library to convert between Java and Scala collections.

3. What is the meaning and purpose of the `ScoredResponse` case class?
- The `ScoredResponse` case class represents a response from the ML ranker that includes a score and an optional breakdown of the features used to calculate the score. The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way to represent the results of a scoring operation.
