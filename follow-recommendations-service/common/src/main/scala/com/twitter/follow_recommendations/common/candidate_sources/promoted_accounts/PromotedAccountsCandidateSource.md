The `PromotedAccountsCandidateSource` class is a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm. It is responsible for generating a list of promoted accounts that a user may be interested in following. 

The class takes in an `AdRequest` object and returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of `PromotedCandidateUser` objects. Each `PromotedCandidateUser` object represents a promoted account that the user may be interested in following. 

To generate the list of promoted accounts, the class first calls the `getAdImpressions` method of the `adserverClient` object to retrieve a list of ad impressions. It then filters the ad impressions to only include those that should show social context, and extracts the promoted account IDs from those impressions. 

Next, the class calls the `getIntersections` method of the `sgsClient` object to retrieve the social graph information for the user and the extracted promoted account IDs. It then creates a `PromotedCandidateUser` object for each promoted account, using the ad impression and social graph information. 

The `PromotedCandidateUser` object contains the ID of the promoted account, the position of the ad impression, the ad impression itself, the social graph information for the promoted account, and the identifier of the candidate source. 

The class also contains several helper methods, including `shouldShowSocialContext`, which determines whether an ad impression should show social context, `getInsertionPositionDefaultValue`, which returns a default insertion position value based on whether the request is a test, and `profileNumResults`, which profiles the number of results returned by the candidate source. 

Overall, the `PromotedAccountsCandidateSource` class is an important component of Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm, as it generates a list of promoted accounts that the user may be interested in following.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a candidate source for promoted accounts that recommends Twitter users to follow based on ad impressions and social graph data.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries and services, including Thrift, Finagle, Stitch, and Twitter's ad server and social graph clients.
3. How are the results of this code profiled and tracked?
- The code uses a StatsReceiver to profile the number of results returned and track failures due to AdServerExceptions and TimeoutExceptions. It also profiles the number of results with less than or equal to 5 recommendations and those with more than 5.
