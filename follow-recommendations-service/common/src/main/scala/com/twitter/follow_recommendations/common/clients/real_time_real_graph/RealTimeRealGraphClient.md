The `RealTimeRealGraphClient` class is a client for interacting with a real-time interaction graph. The class provides methods for retrieving information about user engagements and recommendations for users to follow based on their recent engagements. 

The `mapUserVertexToEngagementAndFilter` method takes a `UserVertex` object and returns a map of user IDs to a sequence of `Engagement` objects. The method filters out engagements that are older than a certain threshold. 

The `getRecentProfileViewEngagements` method takes a user ID and returns a map of user IDs to a sequence of `Engagement` objects. The method retrieves the user's `UserVertex` object and maps it to engagements using the `mapUserVertexToEngagementAndFilter` method. It then filters out engagements that are not profile views. 

The `getUsersRecentlyEngagedWith` method takes a user ID, a map of engagement types to scores, and two boolean flags indicating whether to include direct follow candidates and non-direct follow candidates. The method retrieves the user's `UserVertex` object and maps it to engagements using the `mapUserVertexToEngagementAndFilter` method. It then scores the engagements based on the provided engagement score map and returns a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. The method filters the candidates based on the direct follow flags and returns the remaining candidates. 

The `getRealGraphWeights` method takes a user ID and returns a map of user IDs to weights. The method retrieves the user's `RealGraphScoresMh` object and maps it to a map of user IDs to weights. 

The `RealTimeRealGraphClient` object contains several constants used by the class, including the maximum number of direct follows, the maximum age of engagements, the maximum age of new users, and engagement score maps. 

Overall, the `RealTimeRealGraphClient` class provides a way to interact with a real-time interaction graph to retrieve user engagements and recommendations for users to follow. It can be used in a larger project to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their recent engagements.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the RealTimeRealGraphClient class?
- The RealTimeRealGraphClient class is a singleton that provides methods for interacting with a real-time interaction graph, including mapping user vertices to engagements, fetching recent profile view engagements, and getting users recently engaged with.

2. What is the significance of the Stitch object used in the getUsersRecentlyEngagedWith method?
- The Stitch object is used to join the results of two asynchronous fetch operations, one for the user vertex and one for the user's neighbors, and return a single result. 

3. What is the difference between the EngagementScoreMap and StrongEngagementScoreMap values in the RealTimeRealGraphClient object?
- The EngagementScoreMap assigns equal scores to all engagement types, while the StrongEngagementScoreMap only assigns scores to Like and Retweet engagements.
