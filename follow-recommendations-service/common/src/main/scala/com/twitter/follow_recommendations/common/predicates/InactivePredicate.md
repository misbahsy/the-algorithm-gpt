The `InactivePredicate` class is a Scala implementation of a predicate that determines whether a candidate user is inactive or not. This class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to filter out inactive users from a list of recommended users. 

The `InactivePredicate` class implements the `Predicate` trait, which takes a tuple of `(HasParams with HasClientContext with HasUserState, CandidateUser)` as input and returns a `Stitch[PredicateResult]`. The `PredicateResult` is an enumeration that can be either `Valid` or `Invalid`. The `Valid` result indicates that the candidate user is active, while the `Invalid` result indicates that the candidate user is inactive. 

The `InactivePredicate` class uses the `userRecommendabilityFetcher` to fetch the `UserRecommendabilityFeatures` for a given candidate user. The `UserRecommendabilityFeatures` is a thrift struct that contains information about a user's activity, such as the last time they updated their status. The `InactivePredicate` class caches the `UserRecommendabilityFeatures` using the `StitchCache` class to avoid making unnecessary requests to the `userRecommendabilityFetcher`. 

The `InactivePredicate` class also has a `disableInactivityPredicate` method that determines whether the inactivity predicate should be disabled or not. This method takes a `target` object, which contains the parameters for the predicate, a `consumerState`, which is the state of the user who is making the recommendation, and a `candidateState`, which is the state of the candidate user. If the `disableInactivityPredicate` method returns `true`, the predicate is disabled, and the candidate user is considered active. 

The `InactivePredicate` class is used in the larger project to filter out inactive users from a list of recommended users. For example, if a user is looking for new accounts to follow, the `InactivePredicate` class can be used to filter out users who have not updated their status in a long time. 

Example usage:

```scala
val inactivePredicate = InactivePredicate(statsReceiver, userRecommendabilityFetcher)

val target = new HasParams with HasClientContext with HasUserState {
  override def params: Map[String, Any] = Map(
    MightBeDisabled -> false,
    OnlyDisableForNewUserStateCandidates -> false,
    DefaultInactivityThreshold -> 30.days,
    UseEggFilter -> true
  )
  override def clientContext: Map[String, Any] = Map.empty
  override def userState: Option[UserState] = Some(UserState.HeavyTweeter)
}

val candidate = new CandidateUser {
  override def id: Long = 1234567890L
}

val result: PredicateResult = Await.result(inactivePredicate.apply((target, candidate)))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an `InactivePredicate` class that implements a `Predicate` interface. It checks whether a candidate user is inactive based on certain conditions.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has several external dependencies, including `com.google.inject`, `com.twitter`, and `javax.inject`. It also uses several classes from the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common` package.

3. What is the caching strategy used in this code?
- This code uses a `StitchCache` to cache the results of a `queryUserRecommendable` method. The cache has a maximum size of 100,000 entries and a time-to-live (TTL) of 12 hours. The cache is read through when checking whether a candidate user is inactive.
