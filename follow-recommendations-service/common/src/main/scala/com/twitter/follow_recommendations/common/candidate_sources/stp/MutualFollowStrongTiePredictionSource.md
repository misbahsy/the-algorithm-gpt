The MutualFollowStrongTiePredictionSource class is a candidate source that returns mutual follows for a given user. It uses a combination of recent follows and followers, as well as mutual follows from a Strong Tie Prediction (STP) features dataset. 

The class takes in two parameters: a SocialGraphClient and a StrongTiePredictionFeaturesOnUserClientColumn. The SocialGraphClient is used to retrieve recent edges (follows and followers) for a given user, while the StrongTiePredictionFeaturesOnUserClientColumn is used to retrieve mutual follows from the STP features dataset. 

The apply method takes in a target object that implements the HasClientContext and HasRecentFollowedUserIds traits. It first checks if the target object has a user ID, and if so, retrieves the recent follows and followers for that user using the SocialGraphClient. It then retrieves mutual follows from the STP features dataset using the StrongTiePredictionFeaturesOnUserClientColumn. The results from both queries are joined using the Stitch library, and the final list of mutual follows is returned as a sequence of CandidateUser objects. 

The class is designed to be used as a candidate source in a larger project that recommends Twitter users to follow. By providing a list of mutual follows, the class can help identify users who are likely to be of interest to the target user. The class can be used in conjunction with other candidate sources to provide a comprehensive list of recommended users. 

Example usage:

```
val sgsClient = new SocialGraphClient()
val stpClient = new StrongTiePredictionFeaturesOnUserClientColumn()
val target = new HasClientContext with HasRecentFollowedUserIds {
  override def getOptionalUserId: Option[Long] = Some(123456789)
  override def recentFollowedUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(Seq(987654321, 234567890))
}

val mutualFollowSource = new MutualFollowStrongTiePredictionSource(sgsClient, stpClient)
val recommendedUsers = mutualFollowSource(target).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `MutualFollowStrongTiePredictionSource` that returns mutual follows between users. It does this by getting mutual follows from recent 100 follows and followers, and then unions this with mutual follows from STP features dataset.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including `SocialGraphClient`, `RecentEdgesQuery`, `CandidateUser`, `HasRecentFollowedUserIds`, `Algorithm`, `CandidateSource`, `CandidateSourceIdentifier`, `HasClientContext`, `RelationshipType`, `Stitch`, and `StrongTiePredictionFeaturesOnUserClientColumn`.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects representing mutual follows between users. The output is obtained by intersecting recent followings and followers with mutual follows from STP features dataset, and then returning the distinct set of user IDs with default candidate scores.
