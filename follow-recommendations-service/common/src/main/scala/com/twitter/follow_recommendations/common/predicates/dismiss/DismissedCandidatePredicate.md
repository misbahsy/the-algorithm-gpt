[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/predicates/dismiss/DismissedCandidatePredicate.scala)

The code defines a predicate called `DismissedCandidatePredicate` that is used to filter out candidate users that have been dismissed by a target user. The predicate takes in a tuple of a `HasDismissedUserIds` object and a `CandidateUser` object. The `HasDismissedUserIds` object contains a set of user IDs that the target user has dismissed, while the `CandidateUser` object represents a user that is being considered as a potential recommendation for the target user to follow.

The `apply` method of the predicate checks if the ID of the candidate user is present in the set of dismissed user IDs of the target user. If the ID is present, the predicate returns an `Invalid` result with a `DismissedId` filter reason. Otherwise, it returns a `Valid` result.

The code uses the `Stitch` library to return the predicate result as a `Stitch` object. The `Stitch` library is a Twitter-specific library that provides a way to compose and execute asynchronous operations. The `ValidStitch` and `DismissedStitch` objects are pre-defined `Stitch` objects that represent a valid and invalid predicate result, respectively.

This predicate is likely used in a larger recommendation system that suggests users for a target user to follow on Twitter. The `DismissedCandidatePredicate` is used to filter out users that the target user has already dismissed, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant and not repetitive. The `HasDismissedUserIds` object is likely populated by the target user dismissing users through the recommendation system. 

Example usage of the `DismissedCandidatePredicate`:

```
val targetUser: HasDismissedUserIds = // get target user with dismissed user IDs
val candidateUser: CandidateUser = // get candidate user to check
val predicate = new DismissedCandidatePredicate()
val result: Stitch[PredicateResult] = predicate.apply((targetUser, candidateUser))
result.map {
  case PredicateResult.Valid => // candidate user is valid
  case PredicateResult.Invalid(filterReasons) => // candidate user is dismissed, handle accordingly
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a predicate for filtering recommended users on Twitter based on whether the target user has dismissed them before. It is likely part of a larger recommendation system.

2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?
- The input is a tuple of a `HasDismissedUserIds` object and a `CandidateUser` object. The output is a `Stitch` object that contains a `PredicateResult`.

3. What is the significance of the `DismissedCandidatePredicate.ValidStitch` and `DismissedCandidatePredicate.DismissedStitch` values?
- These values are used to create `Stitch` objects that represent whether the candidate user is valid or dismissed based on whether they have been dismissed by the target user before. They are returned by the `apply` method to indicate the result of the predicate evaluation.
