The code defines a case class called QueryOption that represents options for querying an address book. The class has eight Boolean fields that correspond to different query options, such as whether to only include discoverable contacts or only confirmed contacts. 

The class also has a method called toThrift that converts the QueryOption object to a Thrift object of type t.QueryOption. This suggests that the larger project may be using Thrift as a serialization framework for communication between different components. 

The QueryOption class can be used to create instances of the class with specific query options set, and then pass those instances to other parts of the project that perform the actual querying of the address book. For example, a function that retrieves a list of contacts from the address book might take a QueryOption object as an argument to specify which contacts to include in the results. 

Here is an example of how the QueryOption class might be used in the larger project:

```
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.addressbook.models.QueryOption

// create a QueryOption object with onlyDiscoverableInResult set to true
val queryOption = QueryOption(
  onlyDiscoverableInExpansion = false,
  onlyConfirmedInExpansion = false,
  onlyDiscoverableInResult = true,
  onlyConfirmedInResult = false,
  fetchGlobalApiNamespace = false,
  isDebugRequest = false,
  resolveEmails = false,
  resolvePhoneNumbers = false
)

// pass the queryOption object to a function that retrieves a list of contacts
val contacts = getAddressBookContacts(queryOption)
``` 

Overall, the QueryOption class provides a flexible way to specify different query options for retrieving contacts from an address book, and can be used in conjunction with other parts of the project that perform the actual querying.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the QueryOption case class?
   - The QueryOption case class is used to store various query options related to address book models, and can be converted to a Thrift object using the toThrift method.
   
2. What is the significance of the com.twitter.addressbook.thriftscala import statement?
   - The import statement is used to import the Thrift-generated Scala classes for the address book service, which are used to convert the QueryOption case class to a Thrift object.
   
3. What is the difference between the onlyDiscoverableInExpansion and onlyDiscoverableInResult options?
   - The onlyDiscoverableInExpansion option filters contacts that are only discoverable in the expansion phase of the address book service, while the onlyDiscoverableInResult option filters contacts that are only discoverable in the final result phase of the service.
