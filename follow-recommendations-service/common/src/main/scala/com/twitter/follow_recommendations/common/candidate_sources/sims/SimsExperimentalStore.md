[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/candidate_sources/sims/SimsExperimentalStore.scala)

The code defines two classes, `SimsExperimentalStore` and `CachedSimsExperimentalStore`, both of which are used as candidate sources for a recommendation algorithm. The `SimsExperimentalStore` class extends `StratoBasedSimsCandidateSourceWithUnitView`, which is a candidate source that fetches recommendations from a Strato-based similarity model. The `CachedSimsExperimentalStore` class extends `CacheBasedSimsStore`, which is a candidate source that caches recommendations in memory to reduce the number of requests to the similarity model.

Both classes take an instance of `SimilarUsersBySimsExperimentalOnUserClientColumn` as a constructor argument, which is a client for fetching recommendations from a similarity model. The `SimsExperimentalStore` class uses this client directly as its fetcher, while the `CachedSimsExperimentalStore` class passes it to the `CacheBasedSimsStore` constructor along with additional parameters for cache size and time-to-live.

The `SimsExperimentalStore` object defines some constants used by both classes, including the identifier for the candidate source (`Algorithm.Sims.toString`), the maximum cache size (1000), and the cache time-to-live (12 hours).

Overall, these classes provide candidate sources for a recommendation algorithm that fetch recommendations from a similarity model and cache them in memory to reduce the number of requests. They are likely used in conjunction with other candidate sources to provide a diverse set of recommendations to users. Here is an example of how the `SimsExperimentalStore` class might be used:

```
val store = new SimsExperimentalStore(simsClient)
val candidateSet = store.getCandidates(userId)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines two classes, `SimsExperimentalStore` and `CachedSimsExperimentalStore`, which are used as candidate sources for Twitter's follow recommendations. They fetch similar users based on a particular algorithm and cache the results for a certain amount of time.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.hermit.model.Algorithm`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.CandidateSourceIdentifier`, `com.twitter.strato.generated.client.recommendations.similarity.SimilarUsersBySimsExperimentalOnUserClientColumn`, and `com.twitter.util.Duration`. It also uses dependency injection with `javax.inject.Inject`.

3. What are the values of `Identifier`, `MaxCacheSize`, and `CacheTTL` in `SimsExperimentalStore`?
- `Identifier` is a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` object with a value of `Algorithm.Sims.toString`. `MaxCacheSize` is an integer with a value of 1000. `CacheTTL` is a `Duration` object with a value of 12 hours.
