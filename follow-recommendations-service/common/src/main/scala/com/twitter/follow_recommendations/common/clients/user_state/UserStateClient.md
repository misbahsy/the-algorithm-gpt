The `UserStateClient` class is responsible for fetching and caching user state data for a given user ID. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves recommending users to follow based on various factors, including user state.

The `getUserState` method takes a user ID as input and returns a `Stitch` object that represents the user's state. The method first checks whether distributed caching is enabled using a `Decider` object. If distributed caching is enabled, the method attempts to read the user's state from a Memcached cluster using a `MemcacheClient` object. If the user's state is not found in the cache, the method fetches the state from a `Fetcher` object and stores it in the cache for future use. If distributed caching is not enabled, the method simply fetches the user's state from the `Fetcher` object.

The `fetchUserState` method is responsible for fetching the user's state from the `Fetcher` object. It takes a user ID as input and returns a `Stitch` object that represents the user's state.

The `UserStateClient` class uses several other classes and objects to accomplish its task. These include `ThriftEnumOptionBijection` for converting between Thrift enums and Scala options, `StatsUtil` for profiling the latency of the `Stitch` object, and `DefaultTimer` for setting a timeout limit on the `Stitch` object.

Overall, the `UserStateClient` class provides a way to fetch and cache user state data for a given user ID. This data can be used in the larger project to recommend users to follow based on various factors. Here is an example of how to use the `UserStateClient` class:

```
val userStateClient = new UserStateClient(userStateFetcher, client, statsReceiver, decider)
val userId = 123456789
val userStateStitch = userStateClient.getUserState(userId)
val userState = Await.result(userStateStitch.toFuture)
println(userState)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a singleton class `UserStateClient` that fetches user state from a cache or a remote server using a `Stitch` object. It solves the problem of efficiently retrieving user state data for Twitter's follow recommendations feature.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including `com.twitter.conversions`, `com.twitter.decider`, `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations`, `com.twitter.stitch`, and `com.twitter.util`. It also uses the `javax.inject` and `java.lang` packages.

3. What is the caching strategy used in this code and how does it work?
- This code uses a distributed caching strategy where user state data is first fetched from a Memcached cluster. If the data is not found in the cache, it is fetched from a remote server using a `Fetcher` object. The cache is updated with the fetched data and subsequent requests for the same data are served from the cache. The cache has a time-to-live (TTL) of 6 hours.
