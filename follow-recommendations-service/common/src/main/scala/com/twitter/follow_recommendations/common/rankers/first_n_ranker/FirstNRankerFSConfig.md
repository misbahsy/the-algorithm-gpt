The code defines a configuration class called FirstNRankerFSConfig that extends the FeatureSwitchConfig class. This class is used to manage feature switches for the FirstNRanker ranker in the larger project. 

The FirstNRankerFSConfig class is annotated with @Singleton, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the project. The class is also injected with dependencies using the @Inject annotation.

The class defines three sequences of feature switch parameters: booleanFSParams, intFSParams, and doubleFSParams. These sequences contain the feature switches that can be toggled on or off for the FirstNRanker ranker. 

The booleanFSParams sequence contains a single feature switch called ScribeRankingInfoInFirstNRanker. This feature switch controls whether ranking information is sent to Scribe, a logging and aggregation system used by Twitter.

The intFSParams sequence contains a single feature switch called CandidatesToRank. This feature switch controls the number of candidates that the FirstNRanker ranker will rank.

The doubleFSParams sequence contains a single feature switch called MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor. This feature switch controls the minimum number of candidates that will be scored by the FirstNRanker ranker.

Overall, the FirstNRankerFSConfig class provides a way to manage feature switches for the FirstNRanker ranker in the larger project. By toggling these feature switches on or off, developers can control the behavior of the FirstNRanker ranker and customize it to fit their needs. 

Example usage:

To toggle the ScribeRankingInfoInFirstNRanker feature switch on, the following code can be used:

```
val config = new FirstNRankerFSConfig()
config.booleanFSParams.find(_.name == "ScribeRankingInfoInFirstNRanker").foreach(_.value = true)
```

To set the CandidatesToRank feature switch to 10, the following code can be used:

```
val config = new FirstNRankerFSConfig()
config.intFSParams.find(_.name == "CandidatesToRank").foreach(_.value = 10)
```

To set the MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor feature switch to 0.5, the following code can be used:

```
val config = new FirstNRankerFSConfig()
config.doubleFSParams.find(_.name == "MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor").foreach(_.value = 0.5)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration class for a feature switch related to ranking recommendations on Twitter, specifically for the FirstNRanker algorithm.
2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
   - This code relies on dependencies from the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.common` and `com.twitter.timelines.configapi` packages, as well as the `javax.inject` package.
3. What are the specific feature switch parameters being configured in this class?
   - This class configures a boolean feature switch parameter for `ScribeRankingInfoInFirstNRanker`, an integer feature switch parameter for `CandidatesToRank`, and a double feature switch parameter for `MinNumCandidatesScoredScaleDownFactor`.
