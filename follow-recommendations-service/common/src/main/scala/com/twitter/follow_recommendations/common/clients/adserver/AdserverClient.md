The `AdserverClient` class is a client for the NewAdServer service provided by Twitter. It is responsible for making ad requests and returning ad impressions. The class is implemented as a singleton and is injected with an instance of `NewAdServer.MethodPerEndpoint`.

The `getAdImpressions` method takes an `AdRequest` object as input and returns a `Stitch` object that wraps a sequence of `AdImpression` objects. The `AdRequest` object is converted to its Thrift representation using the `toThrift` method before being passed to the `makeAdRequest` method of the `adserverService` object. The `makeAdRequest` method returns a `Future` object that is then mapped to the `impressions` field of the response object.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves serving ads to users. The `AdserverClient` class provides a convenient way to interact with the NewAdServer service and retrieve ad impressions. The `Stitch` object returned by the `getAdImpressions` method allows for asynchronous processing of the ad impressions, which can be useful in a high-traffic environment where ad requests need to be processed quickly.

Example usage:

```
val adRequest = AdRequest(...)
val adserverClient = AdserverClient(...)
val adImpressions: Seq[AdImpression] = adserverClient.getAdImpressions(adRequest).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class for an AdserverClient that makes a call to an ad server to retrieve ad impressions based on an ad request.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on the `com.twitter.adserver.thriftscala` and `com.twitter.stitch` libraries, as well as the `javax.inject` library for dependency injection.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `getAdImpressions` method?
   - The `getAdImpressions` method expects an `AdRequest` object as input and returns a `Stitch` object containing a sequence of `t.AdImpression` objects.
