The `HasUserCandidateSourceDetails` trait is used to keep track of a candidate's source for filtering candidates from specific sources. It contains several methods that allow for accessing and modifying the candidate's source details. 

The `getAlgorithm` method returns the algorithm associated with the candidate's primary source. It does this by first checking if the candidate has any source details and then retrieving the primary source identifier. It then uses the `Algorithm.withNameOpt` method to retrieve the algorithm associated with the identifier. If the algorithm cannot be found, an exception is thrown.

The `getAllAlgorithms` method returns a sequence of all algorithms associated with the candidate's sources. It does this by retrieving all source identifiers using the `getCandidateSources` method and then using `Algorithm.withNameOpt` to retrieve the algorithms associated with each identifier.

The `getAddressBookMetadata` method returns the address book metadata associated with the candidate's source details. It does this by retrieving the address book metadata from the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object.

The `getCandidateSources` method returns a map of candidate source identifiers and their associated scores. It does this by retrieving the candidate source scores from the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object.

The `getCandidateRanks` method returns a map of candidate source identifiers and their associated ranks. It does this by retrieving the candidate source ranks from the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object.

The `getCandidateFeatures` method returns a map of candidate source identifiers and their associated features. It does this by retrieving the candidate source features from the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object.

The `getPrimaryCandidateSource` method returns the primary candidate source identifier. It does this by retrieving the primary candidate source identifier from the `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object.

The `withCandidateSource` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified candidate source identifier. It does this by calling the `withCandidateSourceAndScore` method with the specified source identifier and the candidate's current score.

The `withCandidateSourceAndScore` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified candidate source identifier, score, and features. It does this by creating a new `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object with the specified details and updating the `CandidateUser` object with the new source details.

The `withCandidateSourceAndFeatures` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified candidate source identifier and features. It does this by calling the `withCandidateSourceScoreAndFeatures` method with the specified source identifier, the candidate's current score, and the specified features.

The `withCandidateSourceScoreAndFeatures` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified candidate source identifier, score, and features. It does this by creating a new `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object with the specified details and updating the `CandidateUser` object with the new source details.

The `addCandidateSourceScoresMap` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified candidate source scores added. It does this by creating a new `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object with the specified scores added and updating the `CandidateUser` object with the new source details.

The `addCandidateSourceRanksMap` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified candidate source ranks added. It does this by creating a new `UserCandidateSourceDetails` object with the specified ranks added and updating the `CandidateUser` object with the new source details.

The `addInfoPerRankingStage` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the specified ranking information added. It does this by creating a new `RankingInfo` object with the specified scores and rank and updating the `CandidateUser` object with the new ranking information.

The `addAddressBookMetadataIfAvailable` method returns a new `CandidateUser` object with the address book metadata added if available. It does this by creating a new `AddressBookMetadata` object with the specified metadata and updating the `CandidateUser` object with the new source details.

Overall, this trait provides a way to manage and manipulate a candidate's source details, which can be used for filtering and ranking candidates in a larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a trait called `HasUserCandidateSourceDetails` which is used to keep track of a candidate's source for filtering purposes. It is likely used in other parts of the project that involve recommending or filtering candidates based on their source.
2. What is the `Algorithm` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `Algorithm` class is imported from another package and is used to represent a candidate's algorithm. It is used in the `getAlgorithm` and `getAllAlgorithms` methods to retrieve the algorithm(s) associated with a candidate's source.
3. What is the purpose of the `AddressBookMetadata` class and how is it used in this code?
- The `AddressBookMetadata` class is used to store information about whether a candidate is in a user's phone or email book. It is used in the `addAddressBookMetadataIfAvailable` method to add this information to a candidate's source details.
