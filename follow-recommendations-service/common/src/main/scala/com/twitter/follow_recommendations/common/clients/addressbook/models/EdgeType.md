This code defines a sealed trait called `EdgeType` and an object called `EdgeType` that extends the trait. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent the type of edge in a graph, specifically in the context of a social network. 

The `EdgeType` trait has a single method called `toThrift` which returns an object of type `t.EdgeType`. The `EdgeType` object has two case objects that extend the trait: `Forward` and `Reverse`. These case objects override the `toThrift` method to return the corresponding `t.EdgeType` value. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to represent the direction of relationships between users in a social network. For example, if user A follows user B, the edge type would be `Forward`. If user B follows user A, the edge type would be `Reverse`. This information can be used to make recommendations for users to follow based on their existing relationships. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.addressbook.models.EdgeType

val edgeType = EdgeType.Forward
val thriftEdgeType = edgeType.toThrift
// thriftEdgeType is now of type t.EdgeType.Forward
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a sealed trait and two case objects for EdgeType, which are used to convert to a Thrift EdgeType. It is likely used in the address book functionality of the project.

2. What is the difference between the Forward and Reverse case objects?
- The Forward and Reverse case objects represent different directions of an edge in the address book. Forward likely represents a user following another user, while Reverse represents a user being followed by another user.

3. What is the significance of using a sealed trait for EdgeType?
- Using a sealed trait allows for exhaustive pattern matching on EdgeType, ensuring that all possible cases are handled. This can help prevent bugs and make the code more robust.
