The `PhoneStorageServiceClient` class is a client for the Phone Storage Service (PSS) API. It provides a method `getPhoneNumbers` that takes a user ID, a purpose of processing, and an optional flag for force carrier lookup. The method returns a `Stitch` object that wraps a sequence of phone numbers associated with the given user ID.

The `getPhoneNumbers` method first creates a `GetUserPhonesByUsersRequest` object with the given user ID, force carrier lookup flag, and purpose of processing. It then calls the `getUserPhonesByUsers` method of the `phoneStorageService` object (which is an instance of `PhoneStorageService.MethodPerEndpoint`) with the request object. The `getUserPhonesByUsers` method returns a `Future` that resolves to a `GetUserPhonesByUsersResponse` object.

The `Stitch.callFuture` method is used to call the `getUserPhonesByUsers` method asynchronously and return a `Stitch` object that wraps the result. The `map` method is then called on the `Stitch` object to extract the phone numbers from the response object.

This code is likely used in the larger project to retrieve phone numbers associated with a given user ID for various purposes, such as sending SMS messages or verifying user identity. The `PhoneStorageServiceClient` class abstracts away the details of making API requests and handling responses, making it easier for other parts of the project to use the PSS API. 

Example usage:

```
val client = new PhoneStorageServiceClient(phoneStorageService)
val userId = 12345L
val purposeOfProcessing = PurposeOfProcessing.Verification
val phoneNumbers = client.getPhoneNumbers(userId, purposeOfProcessing).run()
println(phoneNumbers)
``` 

This code creates a new `PhoneStorageServiceClient` object with a `phoneStorageService` instance, sets the user ID and purpose of processing, and calls the `getPhoneNumbers` method to retrieve the associated phone numbers. The `run` method is called on the resulting `Stitch` object to execute the API request and return the phone numbers as a sequence. Finally, the phone numbers are printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PhoneStorageServiceClient` class?
- The `PhoneStorageServiceClient` class is a client for the `PhoneStorageService` API that provides a method for retrieving phone numbers for a given user ID and purpose of processing.

2. What is the `Stitch` object used for in this code?
- The `Stitch` object is used to asynchronously call the `getUserPhonesByUsers` method of the `PhoneStorageService` API and map the resulting `userPhones` to their phone numbers.

3. What is the significance of the `forceCarrierLookup` parameter in the `getPhoneNumbers` method?
- The `forceCarrierLookup` parameter is an optional boolean value that, if set to `true`, forces the `PhoneStorageService` API to perform a carrier lookup for the phone number(s) returned.
