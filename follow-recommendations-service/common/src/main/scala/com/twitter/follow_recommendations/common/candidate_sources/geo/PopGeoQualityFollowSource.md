The code defines two classes, `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` and `PopGeoQualityFollowSource`, and two objects, `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` and `PopGeoQualityFollowSource`. The purpose of these classes and objects is to provide a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm based on the popularity of users in a given geographic location.

The `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` class is a `CandidateSource` that takes a geographic location as input and returns a list of `CandidateUser`s. It uses a `UniquePopQualityFollowUsersInPlaceClientColumn` to fetch the most popular users in the given location and returns them as `CandidateUser`s. The `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` class also implements a cache using a `StitchCache` to store the results of previous queries and avoid unnecessary network requests. The cache has a maximum size of 20,000 entries and a time-to-live of 24 hours.

The `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` class extends `BasePopGeohashSource` and provides a candidate source that returns users based on their popularity in a geographic region defined by a geohash. It takes a `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` and a `StatsReceiver` as input and uses them to configure its behavior. The `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` class overrides several methods from its parent class to customize its behavior, including `maxResults`, `minGeohashLength`, `maxGeohashLength`, `returnResultFromAllPrecision`, and `candidateSourceEnabled`. It also defines a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` that identifies it as a candidate source for the follow recommendations algorithm.

The `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` and `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` objects define constants and identifiers used by their respective classes. The `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` object defines an identifier for the `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` class, while the `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` object defines constants for the cache size, cache time-to-live, and maximum number of results to return.

Overall, these classes and objects provide a way for the follow recommendations algorithm to recommend popular users in a given geographic location or region. The `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` class fetches the most popular users in a location, while the `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` class fetches the most popular users in a region defined by a geohash. The cache implemented by the `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` class helps to reduce the number of network requests required to fetch the most popular users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines two classes, `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` and `PopGeoQualityFollowSource`, which are used to retrieve candidate users for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm based on their popularity in a given geographic location.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including Google Guice, Twitter's Finagle and Util libraries, and the Hermit and Strato frameworks.

3. How are candidate users selected and returned by these classes?
- The `PopGeoQualityFollowSource` class retrieves candidate users from a Thrift service and caches the results using a `StitchCache`. The `PopGeohashQualityFollowSource` class extends this functionality by filtering the results based on geohash precision and returning the top-scoring candidates. The candidate users are returned as a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects, which include the user's ID, score, and a reason for their recommendation.
