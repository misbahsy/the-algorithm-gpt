The `RealGraphSource` class is a candidate source for the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm. It retrieves already followed edges from the real graph column and returns them as a candidate source. 

The class imports several dependencies, including the `RealTimeRealGraphClient` for accessing the real graph, and the `CandidateSource` interface for defining a candidate source. The `RealGraphSource` class implements the `CandidateSource` interface and overrides its methods. 

The `apply` method takes a `HasParams with HasClientContext` request and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[CandidateUser]`. The method first checks if the request contains a user ID. If it does, it calls the `getRealGraphWeights` method of the `RealTimeRealGraphClient` to retrieve the real graph weights for that user. The method then maps the score map to a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects, where each object represents a candidate user with an ID and a real graph score. Finally, the method sets the candidate source identifier for each `CandidateUser` object and returns the sequence. If the request does not contain a user ID, the method returns `Stitch.Nil`.

The `RealGraphSource` class also defines a companion object with a `Identifier` value that is a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` with the value `Algorithm.RealGraphFollowed.toString`. This value is used to identify the candidate source in the larger follow recommendations algorithm.

Overall, the `RealGraphSource` class provides a way to retrieve already followed edges from the real graph column and use them as a candidate source in the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm. Here is an example of how the `apply` method might be used:

```
val realGraphClient = new RealTimeRealGraphClient()
val realGraphSource = new RealGraphSource(realGraphClient)
val request = new HasParams with HasClientContext {
  override def getOptionalUserId: Option[Long] = Some(1234567890L)
}
val candidateUsers: Seq[CandidateUser] = realGraphSource.apply(request).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a candidate source for a recommendation algorithm that gets already followed edges from a real graph column.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including `RealTimeRealGraphClient`, `Algorithm`, `CandidateSource`, `CandidateSourceIdentifier`, `HasClientContext`, `Stitch`, and `HasParams`.

3. How does this code handle missing user IDs?
- If the request object passed to the `apply` method does not contain a user ID, the method returns an empty `Stitch` object.
