The RandomScorer class is a part of the machine learning (ML) ranker module of The Algorithm from Twitter project. This class assigns random scores between 0 and 1 to each candidate. The purpose of this class is to provide a baseline for comparison with other rankers. 

The class imports several dependencies, including the DeepbirdPredictionService, which is used to make predictions, and the StatsReceiver, which is used to collect statistics. The class is annotated with @Singleton, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. 

The RandomScorer class extends the DeepbirdScorer class, which provides a predict function that takes a sequence of DataRecords and returns a Future of a sequence of Option[Double]. The predict function in the RandomScorer class overrides the predict function in the DeepbirdScorer class. The predict function in the RandomScorer class generates random scores for each candidate in the input sequence. If the input sequence is empty, the function returns Future.Nil. 

The RandomScorer class also overrides the predictionFeature variable in the DeepbirdScorer class. The predictionFeature variable is a Feature object that represents the feature used for prediction. In the RandomScorer class, the predictionFeature variable is set to a new Feature.Continuous object with the name "prediction.pfollow_pengagement". 

Overall, the RandomScorer class is a simple implementation of a ranker that assigns random scores to candidates. It is used as a baseline for comparison with other rankers in the ML ranker module of The Algorithm from Twitter project. 

Example usage:

```
val scorer = new RandomScorer(deepbirdClient, statsReceiver)
val dataRecords = Seq(DataRecord(Seq(Feature.Continuous("feature1", 0.5))))
val scores = scorer.predict(dataRecords)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a scorer called RandomScorer that assigns random values between 0 and 1 as scores to each candidate.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries and services, including DeepbirdPredictionService, StatsReceiver, GuiceNamedConstants, and Twitter's ML API.

3. How are scores assigned to candidates?
- All candidates are assigned a random value between 0 and 1 as score using the `rnd.nextDouble()` method.
