The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` class is a candidate source for the Twitter follow recommendations algorithm. It is a two-hop expansion over the follow graph, which means that it returns users that get followed by the target user's recent followings. The class extends the `TwoHopExpansionCandidateSource` class and takes in a `SocialGraphClient` and a `StatsReceiver` as parameters. 

The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` class has three methods that are overridden from the `TwoHopExpansionCandidateSource` class. The `firstDegreeNodes` method returns the recent followed user IDs of the target user. The `secondaryDegreeNodes` method takes in a target user and a node and returns the recent followings of the node. The `aggregateAndScore` method takes in a target user and a map of first-degree to second-degree nodes and returns a list of candidate users with their scores and reasons for recommendation.

The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` class calls the `SocialGraph` API `n` + 1 times, where `n` is the number of recent followings of the target user to be considered. The class retrieves the first five recent followed user IDs of the target user and the recent followings of the first-degree nodes. It then aggregates the second-degree nodes and scores them based on the number of connections they have with the first-degree nodes. The class returns a list of candidate users with their scores and reasons for recommendation.

This class is used in the larger Twitter follow recommendations algorithm to provide recommendations to users based on their recent followings. The algorithm uses multiple candidate sources to provide a diverse set of recommendations to users. The `RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource` class is one of the candidate sources that the algorithm uses to provide recommendations. 

Example usage:

```
val socialGraphClient = new SocialGraphClient()
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()

val candidateSource = new RecentFollowingRecentFollowingExpansionSource(socialGraphClient, statsReceiver)

val targetUser = new HasParams with HasRecentFollowedUserIds {
  override def params: Map[String, Any] = Map.empty
  override def recentFollowedUserIds: Option[Seq[Long]] = Some(Seq(123456, 789012, 345678, 901234, 567890))
}

val candidateUsers = candidateSource.candidates(targetUser)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a candidate source for a follow recommendation algorithm on Twitter. It expands the follow graph by two hops and returns users that are followed by the target user's recent followings.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries and packages, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations`, `com.twitter.hermit.model`, `com.twitter.inject.Logging`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model`, `com.twitter.socialgraph.thriftscala`, and `com.twitter.stitch`.

3. What is the algorithm used in this code and how does it work?
- The algorithm used in this code is a two hop expansion over the follow graph. It retrieves the target user's recent followings and then retrieves the users followed by those recent followings. It then aggregates and scores the candidate users based on the number of connections they have to the recent followings.
