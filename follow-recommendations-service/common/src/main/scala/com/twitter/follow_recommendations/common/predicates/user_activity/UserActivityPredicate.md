This code defines a set of classes that implement a user activity predicate for Twitter's follow recommendations service. The purpose of this code is to filter out candidate users who do not meet certain activity criteria, such as being a heavy tweeter or having a minimum level of activity. 

The `UserStateActivityPredicate` abstract class defines the core functionality of the user activity predicate. It takes in a set of valid candidate states, a memcached client, and a decider, and returns a `PredicateResult` based on whether the candidate user's activity state is valid or not. The `apply` method takes in a tuple of a `HasParams` object and a `CandidateUser` object, and returns a `Stitch[PredicateResult]` object. The `queryUserRecommendable` method queries the user recommendability client for a given user ID and returns a `Stitch[Option[UserState]]` object. The `memcacheClient` object is used to cache the results of the `queryUserRecommendable` method.

The `MinStateUserActivityPredicate`, `AllTweeterUserActivityPredicate`, `HeavyTweeterUserActivityPredicate`, and `NonNearZeroUserActivityPredicate` classes are concrete implementations of the `UserStateActivityPredicate` class. They each take in a user recommendability client, a memcached client, and a stats receiver, and set the `validCandidateStates` field to a specific set of user states. These classes are used to filter out candidate users based on different activity criteria.

Overall, this code is used to filter out candidate users who do not meet certain activity criteria. It is likely used in conjunction with other filters and algorithms to generate a list of recommended users for a given user. An example usage of this code might look like:

```
val candidateUser = CandidateUser(id = 12345, name = "John Doe", activityState = UserState.HeavyTweeter)
val userActivityPredicate = new HeavyTweeterUserActivityPredicate(userRecommendabilityClient, memcachedClient, statsReceiver)
val result = userActivityPredicate.apply((params, candidateUser)).get
if (result.isValid) {
  println("Candidate user is valid")
} else {
  println("Candidate user is invalid")
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines several classes that implement a user activity predicate for Twitter's follow recommendations system. The predicates determine whether a candidate user is active enough to be recommended to a target user.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several libraries and services, including Finagle, Memcached, Stitch, and Strato. It also relies on a Thrift service for fetching user recommendability data.

3. How does this code handle caching of user state data?
- This code uses a Memcached client to cache user state data for a configurable amount of time. It also checks a decider to determine whether to use distributed caching or not. If distributed caching is enabled, the client reads from the cache first and falls back to querying the Thrift service if the cache is empty. If distributed caching is disabled, the client queries the Thrift service directly.
