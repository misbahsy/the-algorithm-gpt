The code defines a configuration class for feature switches related to feature hydration sources in the Twitter Algorithm project. Feature switches are used to turn on or off certain features in a software system. This class extends the FeatureSwitchConfig class and defines two sequences of feature switch parameters: booleanFSParams and durationFSParams. 

The booleanFSParams sequence contains a list of boolean parameters that can be turned on or off. These parameters control various features related to candidate users, target users, topics, and client features. For example, the EnableCandidateUserFeatures parameter controls whether candidate user features are enabled or not. 

The durationFSParams sequence contains a list of duration parameters that control the duration of certain features. For example, the GlobalFetchTimeout parameter controls the maximum amount of time allowed for a global fetch operation. 

This class is used to configure the feature switches for the feature hydration sources in the larger Twitter Algorithm project. Other classes in the project can use these feature switches to enable or disable certain features based on the needs of the project. For example, if the EnableCandidateUserFeatures parameter is turned off, then candidate user features will not be used in the project. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:

```
val featureHydrationSourcesFSConfig = new FeatureHydrationSourcesFSConfig()
if (featureHydrationSourcesFSConfig.booleanFSParams.contains(FeatureStoreSourceParams.EnableCandidateUserFeatures)) {
  // enable candidate user features
} else {
  // disable candidate user features
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a configuration for feature switches related to a project called The Algorithm from Twitter, specifically for feature hydration sources.
2. What are some of the specific feature switches that are being configured in this code?
   - Some of the specific feature switches being configured include enabling/disabling various candidate and target user features, topic aggregate features, and user-client features.
3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations in this code?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application, while the `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor as one that should be used for dependency injection.
