This code defines a set of parameters for a recommendation algorithm that expands a user's network by suggesting similar users to follow based on recent following activity. The `RecentFollowingSimilarUsersParams` object contains four case objects that define the maximum number of nodes to expand in the first and second degree, the maximum number of results to return, and whether to integrate timestamps into the recommendation algorithm.

The `MaxFirstDegreeNodes` parameter limits the number of first-degree nodes to expand from the user's recent following activity. The default value is set to 10, but can be adjusted between 0 and 200. The `MaxSecondaryDegreeExpansionPerNode` parameter limits the number of second-degree nodes to expand per first-degree node. The default value is set to 40, but can also be adjusted between 0 and 200.

The `MaxResults` parameter limits the number of recommended users to return. The default value is set to 200, but can be adjusted between 0 and 200. Finally, the `TimestampIntegrated` parameter determines whether to integrate timestamps into the recommendation algorithm. The default value is set to false, but can be set to true to consider the recency of the user's following activity.

These parameters can be used in the larger recommendation algorithm to fine-tune the expansion of a user's network based on their recent following activity. For example, the `MaxFirstDegreeNodes` parameter can be increased to expand the network further, while the `MaxResults` parameter can be decreased to provide a more targeted set of recommendations. The `TimestampIntegrated` parameter can also be used to prioritize more recent following activity in the recommendations.

Overall, this code provides a flexible set of parameters for the recommendation algorithm to optimize the expansion of a user's network based on their recent following activity.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?
- This code defines parameters for recent following similar users in the candidate sources for sims expansion.
2. What are the valid ranges for the MaxFirstDegreeNodes, MaxSecondaryDegreeExpansionPerNode, and MaxResults parameters?
- MaxFirstDegreeNodes has a valid range of 0 to 200, MaxSecondaryDegreeExpansionPerNode has a valid range of 0 to 200, and MaxResults has a valid range of 0 to 200.
3. What is the purpose of the TimestampIntegrated parameter and how does it affect the algorithm?
- The TimestampIntegrated parameter is a boolean that determines whether or not to integrate the timestamp into the recent following similarity calculation. If set to true, the algorithm will take into account the timestamp of the follow action when calculating similarity.
