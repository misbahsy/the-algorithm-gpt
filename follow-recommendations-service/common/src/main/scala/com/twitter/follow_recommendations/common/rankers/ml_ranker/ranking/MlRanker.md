The `MlRanker` class is a ranker that performs four steps to rank a list of `CandidateUser` objects. The four steps are:

1. Choose which scorer to use for each candidate.
2. Score candidates given their respective features.
3. Add scoring information to the candidate.
4. Sort candidates by their respective scores.

The feature source and scorer will depend on the request's parameters. The class has a `rank` function that takes a `Target` object and a list of `CandidateUser` objects as input and returns a `Stitch` object that contains the ranked list of `CandidateUser` objects. The `Target` object contains the request parameters that determine the feature source and scorer for each candidate.

The `MlRanker` class uses the `ScorerFactory` class to get the list of scorers to use for each candidate. The scorers are split into two categories: ML-based and Adhoc. The ML-based scorers require calling an ML prediction service to score candidates, while the Adhoc scorers use locally-available data to score candidates.

The `MlRanker` class also has two helper functions: `chooseRankerByCandidate` and `addMlBaseScoresForAdhocScorers`. The `chooseRankerByCandidate` function chooses the scorer to use for each candidate based on the candidate's parameters and the request parameters. The `addMlBaseScoresForAdhocScorers` function adds the ML base scores for Adhoc scorers to the candidate's scores.

The `MlRanker` class uses the `StatsReceiver` class to collect statistics about the ranking process. The statistics are collected for each step of the ranking process: input, select scorer, and score.

Overall, the `MlRanker` class is an important component of the larger project that performs the task of ranking a list of `CandidateUser` objects based on their features and the request parameters. The class is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new scorers and features in the future.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a ranker class that performs 4 steps to rank a list of candidate users based on their features and scores. It selects a scorer for each candidate, scores the candidates, adds scoring information to each candidate, and sorts the candidates by their scores. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to rank candidate users for recommendation based on their features and scores.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including Google Guava, Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, Twitter Stitch, Twitter Util, and Twitter Product Mixer. It also uses several internal libraries and dependencies from the Twitter Follow Recommendations project.

3. What is the role of the `Scorer` and `ScorerFactory` classes in this code?
- The `Scorer` class is an abstract class that defines a method for scoring a list of data records. The `ScorerFactory` class is a factory class that creates instances of `Scorer` subclasses based on their IDs. These classes are used to score the candidate users based on their features and scores.
