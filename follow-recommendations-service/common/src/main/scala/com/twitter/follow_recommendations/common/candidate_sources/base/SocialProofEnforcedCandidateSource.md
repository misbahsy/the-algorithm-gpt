The `SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource` class is an abstract class that extends the `CandidateSource` class. It enforces a minimum number of social proofs required for a candidate user to be recommended as a follow recommendation. The class takes in a `CandidateSource` object, a `ModifySocialProof` object, a minimum number of social proofs required, a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. 

The `apply` method takes in a `HasClientContext with HasParams` object and returns a `Stitch` object that contains a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. The method first extracts various parameters from the `HasClientContext with HasParams` object. It then calls the `candidateSource` object's `apply` method to get a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. 

The method then filters out the `CandidateUser` objects that do not have enough social proofs. It annotates the filtered `CandidateUser` objects with additional social proofs using the `modifySocialProof` object's `hydrateSocialProof` method. The annotated `CandidateUser` objects are then returned along with the original `CandidateUser` objects that have enough social proofs. 

This class is used as a base class for other classes that implement different candidate sources. These classes can inherit from this class and override the `candidateSource` object to implement their own candidate source. The `SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource` class ensures that the candidate users recommended by the candidate source have a minimum number of social proofs. 

Example usage:

```scala
val socialProofEnforcedCandidateSource = new SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource(
  candidateSource = myCandidateSource,
  modifySocialProof = myModifySocialProof,
  minNumSocialProofsRequired = 5,
  identifier = myCandidateSourceIdentifier,
  baseStatsReceiver = myStatsReceiver
) {}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code defines an abstract class for a candidate source that enforces a minimum number of social proofs for each candidate user. It solves the problem of recommending users to follow on Twitter based on social proof.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on? 
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `StatsReceiver`, `CandidateUser`, `ModifySocialProof`, `CandidateSource`, `CandidateSourceIdentifier`, `HasClientContext`, `HasParams`, `Stitch`, and `Duration`.

3. What parameters does the `apply` method take and what does it return? 
- The `apply` method takes a `target` parameter of type `HasClientContext with HasParams` and returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. It also uses several other parameters that are extracted from the `target` parameter, such as `mustCallSgs`, `QueryIntersectionIdsNum`, and `MaxNumCandidatesToAnnotate`.
