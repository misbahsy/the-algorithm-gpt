[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/candidate_sources/recent_engagement/RepeatedProfileVisitsFSConfig.scala)

The code defines a configuration class called RepeatedProfileVisitsFSConfig that extends the FeatureSwitchConfig class. This class is responsible for managing feature switches for the recent engagement candidate source in the Twitter follow recommendations system. 

The class has two types of parameters: boolean and integer. The boolean parameters are defined as a sequence of Param[Boolean] with FSName, which includes two parameters: IncludeCandidates and UseOnlineDataset. The integer parameters are defined as a sequence of FSBoundedParam[Int], which includes two parameters: RecommendationThreshold and BucketingThreshold. 

The purpose of this configuration class is to allow for easy management of feature switches for the recent engagement candidate source. By using this class, developers can easily turn on or off certain features, such as including candidates or using an online dataset, without having to modify the code directly. 

For example, if a developer wants to turn off the UseOnlineDataset feature, they can simply set the value of the corresponding boolean parameter to false in the configuration file, rather than having to modify the code directly. 

Overall, this class plays an important role in the larger Twitter follow recommendations system by providing a flexible and easy-to-use way to manage feature switches for the recent engagement candidate source.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code is a configuration file for a feature switch related to candidate sources for Twitter's follow recommendations. It is likely used in conjunction with other code related to generating these recommendations.

2. What are the boolean and integer parameters being configured in this file?
- The boolean parameters being configured are `IncludeCandidates` and `UseOnlineDataset`. The integer parameters being configured are `RecommendationThreshold` and `BucketingThreshold`.

3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations in this code?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to indicate that this class should be automatically instantiated and injected by a dependency injection framework.
