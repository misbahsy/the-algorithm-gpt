The code in this file is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this code is to hydrate additional social proof on each of the provided candidates by making a request to gfs/sgs. The code defines three classes: ModifySocialProof, ModifySocialProofTransform, and an object ModifySocialProof.

The object ModifySocialProof defines a method called addIntersectionIdsToCandidate, which takes a candidate object, follow proof to be added, and stats for tracking as input parameters. The method creates an updated set of social proof by adding the follow proof to the existing social proof of the candidate. The method then returns the updated candidate object.

The class ModifySocialProof defines a method called hydrateSocialProof, which takes a user ID, a list of candidates, and other optional parameters as input. The method gets the intersection IDs between the user and the candidate, appending the unique results to the social proof (followedBy field) if not already previously seen. The method queries GFS for all users, except for cases specified via the mustCallSgs field or for very new users, who would not have any data in GFS, due to the lag duration of the service's processing. The method then returns a list of candidates updated with additional social proof.

The class ModifySocialProofTransform defines a method called transform, which takes a target and a list of candidates as input parameters. The method uses ModifySocialProof (which makes a request to gfs/sgs) for hydrating additional social proof on each of the provided candidates.

In summary, this code is used to add social proof to candidate objects by making a request to gfs/sgs. The ModifySocialProofTransform class uses the ModifySocialProof class to transform a list of candidates by adding social proof to them. This code is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ModifySocialProof` object and its `addIntersectionIdsToCandidate` method?
   
   The `ModifySocialProof` object contains a method called `addIntersectionIdsToCandidate` that updates a candidate's social proof by adding intersection IDs. The purpose of this method is to create an updated set of social proof for a given candidate by adding the intersection IDs between the user and the candidate.

2. What is the purpose of the `ModifySocialProof` class and its `hydrateSocialProof` method?
   
   The `ModifySocialProof` class makes a request to GFS/SGS for hydrating additional social proof on each of the provided candidates. The purpose of the `hydrateSocialProof` method is to update the social proof of each candidate by getting the intersection IDs between the user and the candidate, and appending the unique results to the social proof (followedBy field) if not already previously seen.

3. What is the purpose of the `ModifySocialProofTransform` class and how does it use the `ModifySocialProof` class?
   
   The `ModifySocialProofTransform` class uses the `ModifySocialProof` class to hydrate additional social proof on each of the provided candidates. The purpose of this transform is to update the social proof of each candidate by making a request to GFS/SGS through the `hydrateSocialProof` method of the `ModifySocialProof` class.
