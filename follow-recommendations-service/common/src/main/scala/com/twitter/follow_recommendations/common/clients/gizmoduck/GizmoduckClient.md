The `GizmoduckClient` class is a client for the Gizmoduck service, which is used to retrieve user information from Twitter. The class has two methods: `isProtected` and `getUserName`. 

The `isProtected` method takes a user ID as input and returns a `Stitch[Boolean]` indicating whether the user's account is protected. The method first calls the `gizmoduckStitchClient.getById` method to retrieve the user's information, passing in the user ID and a set of query fields that includes the `Safety` field. The `StatsUtil.profileStitch` method is used to measure the latency of the `getById` call. The method then extracts the `isProtected` field from the user's `Safety` object and returns it as a `Boolean`.

The `getUserName` method takes two user IDs as input: the ID of the user whose name is being retrieved, and the ID of the user who is making the request. The method returns a `Stitch[Option[String]]` containing the user's name, or `None` if the user does not exist or the requesting user does not have permission to view the name. The method first constructs a `LookupContext` object containing the requesting user's ID and a set of perspective edges, which determine the scope of the lookup. The method then calls the `gizmoduckStitchClient.getUserById` method to retrieve the user's information, passing in the user ID, a set of query fields that includes the `Profile` field, and the `LookupContext` object. The `StatsUtil.profileStitch` method is used to measure the latency of the `getUserById` call. The method then extracts the user's name from the `Profile` object and returns it as an `Option[String]`.

The `GizmoduckClient` class is designed to be used as a dependency in other classes that require user information from Gizmoduck. The class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of the class should be created and shared across the application. The class takes two dependencies in its constructor: a `Gizmoduck` client and a `StatsReceiver` for measuring latency metrics. The `Gizmoduck` client is used to make requests to the Gizmoduck service, while the `StatsReceiver` is used to measure the latency of those requests. 

The `GizmoduckClient` object contains two sets of query fields: `GetUserByIdQueryFields` and `GetUserByIdUserNameQueryFields`. These sets are used to specify which fields should be included in the `getUserById` method call. The `DefaultPerspectiveEdges` set is used to specify which perspective edges should be included in the `LookupContext` object. These sets are defined as `val`s, indicating that they are immutable and can be safely shared across the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a `GizmoduckClient` class that communicates with the Gizmoduck service to retrieve user information. It has methods to check if a user is protected and to get a user's name.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, `com.twitter.stitch.gizmoduck.Gizmoduck`, and `javax.inject.Inject`.

3. What metrics are being tracked and how are they being tracked?
- This code is tracking latency metrics using the `StatsUtil.profileStitch` method when calling the `getById` and `getUserById` methods. The latency metrics are being tracked using the `StatsReceiver` and are scoped to `gizmoduck_client`, `get_by_id`, and `get_user_by_id`.
