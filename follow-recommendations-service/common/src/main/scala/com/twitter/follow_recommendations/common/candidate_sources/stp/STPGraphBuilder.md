The `STPGraphBuilder` class is responsible for building a `STPGraph` object, which represents a graph of users and their relationships on Twitter. The graph is built using two fetchers, `STPFirstDegreeFetcher` and `STPSecondDegreeFetcher`, which retrieve information about the users and their relationships. 

The `STPGraphBuilder` class is a singleton, meaning that there is only one instance of this class throughout the entire application. This is achieved using the `@Singleton` annotation. The class is also injected with three dependencies: `STPFirstDegreeFetcher`, `STPSecondDegreeFetcher`, and `StatsReceiver`. 

The `apply` method is the main method of the class, which takes a `target` object as input and returns a `Stitch[STPGraph]` object. The `target` object is a combination of three traits: `HasClientContext`, `HasParams`, and `HasRecentFollowedUserIds`. These traits provide information about the user for whom the graph is being built. 

The `apply` method first calls the `getFirstDegreeEdges` method of the `STPFirstDegreeFetcher` object to retrieve the first degree edges of the user. The first degree edges represent the users that the target user is directly following. The method then adds the size of the first degree edges to a `firstDegreeStat` object, which is used to keep track of statistics related to the first degree edges. 

The `getSecondDegreeEdges` method of the `STPSecondDegreeFetcher` object is then called with the `target` object and the first degree edges as input. This method retrieves the second degree edges of the user, which represent the users that the target user's first degree edges are following. The method then adds the size of the first degree edges to a `secondDegreeStat` object, which is used to keep track of statistics related to the second degree edges. 

Finally, the `STPGraph` object is created using the first and second degree edges, and returned as a `Stitch[STPGraph]` object. The `toList` method is called on the edges to convert them to a list before creating the `STPGraph` object. 

Overall, the `STPGraphBuilder` class is an important component of the larger project, as it is responsible for building the graph of users and their relationships on Twitter. The class uses two fetchers to retrieve information about the users and their relationships, and provides statistics about the size of the first and second degree edges. The `STPGraph` object that is created by this class can be used for various purposes, such as recommending new users to follow based on the target user's relationships. 

Example usage:

```
val targetUser: HasClientContext with HasParams with HasRecentFollowedUserIds = // create target user object
val stpGraphBuilder = new STPGraphBuilder(stpFirstDegreeFetcher, stpSecondDegreeFetcher, statsReceiver)
val stpGraph: Stitch[STPGraph] = stpGraphBuilder(targetUser)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code builds an STPGraph object using first and second degree edges fetched from a target user's recent followed user IDs. It solves the problem of generating recommendations for users to follow on Twitter.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including com.twitter.finagle.stats, com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.request, com.twitter.stitch, and com.twitter.timelines.configapi.

3. What is the significance of the StatsReceiver and Stat objects in this code?
- The StatsReceiver and Stat objects are used to track and record statistics related to the number of first and second degree edges fetched during the process of building the STPGraph object. These statistics can be used for monitoring and optimization purposes.
