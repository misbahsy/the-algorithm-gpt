The code above defines a class called `GizmoduckPredicateFSConfig` that extends the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class. This class is responsible for managing feature switches for the GizmoduckPredicate, which is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `GizmoduckPredicateFSConfig` class has a single constructor that takes no arguments and is annotated with `@Inject` and `@Singleton`. This indicates that the class is intended to be used as a singleton and can be injected into other classes using a dependency injection framework like Guice.

The `GizmoduckPredicateFSConfig` class overrides the `durationFSParams` method of the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class. This method returns a sequence of `FSBoundedParam` objects that represent feature switches with duration parameters. In this case, the only feature switch defined is `GizmoduckGetTimeout`, which is defined in the `GizmoduckPredicateParams` object.

The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for managing feature switches related to the GizmoduckPredicate. By extending the `FeatureSwitchConfig` class, it can take advantage of the built-in feature switch management functionality provided by the larger project. Other classes can then use this class to enable or disable features related to the GizmoduckPredicate.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in another class:

```scala
class GizmoduckPredicate {
  val config = new GizmoduckPredicateFSConfig()

  def getTimeout: Duration = {
    config.getDuration(GizmoduckGetTimeout)
  }
}
```

In this example, the `GizmoduckPredicate` class creates an instance of the `GizmoduckPredicateFSConfig` class and uses it to retrieve the value of the `GizmoduckGetTimeout` feature switch. This value can then be used to control the behavior of the `GizmoduckPredicate` class.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a part of the Gizmoduck package in the Follow Recommendations module of the Twitter project. It defines a configuration class for feature switches related to GizmoduckPredicateParams.

2. What are GizmoduckPredicateParams and how are they used in this code?
- GizmoduckPredicateParams are a set of feature switch parameters used in the Gizmoduck package. In this code, the durationFSParams sequence is defined using GizmoduckGetTimeout, which is a member of GizmoduckPredicateParams.

3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @Inject annotations in this code?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that only one instance of GizmoduckPredicateFSConfig should be created and used throughout the application. The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that this class should be instantiated and managed by a dependency injection framework.
