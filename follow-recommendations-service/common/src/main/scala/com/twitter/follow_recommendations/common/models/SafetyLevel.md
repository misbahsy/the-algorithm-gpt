[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/models/SafetyLevel.scala)

The code defines a sealed trait called `SafetyLevel` and an object called `SafetyLevel` that contains two case objects that extend the `SafetyLevel` trait. The purpose of this code is to provide a mapping between two different safety level systems: one used internally by Twitter and another used by an external system that interacts with Twitter. 

The `SafetyLevel` trait has a single abstract method called `toThrift` that returns a `ThriftSafetyLevel` object. The `ThriftSafetyLevel` object is defined in a different package and is used by the external system. The two case objects, `Recommendations` and `TopicsLandingPageTopicRecommendations`, implement the `toThrift` method and return the corresponding `ThriftSafetyLevel` values. 

This code can be used in the larger project to ensure that the safety level values used internally by Twitter are correctly mapped to the corresponding values used by the external system. For example, if the external system needs to retrieve recommendations from Twitter, it can use the `TopicsLandingPageTopicRecommendations` safety level value to ensure that the recommendations are appropriate for display on a landing page. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:

```scala
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.SafetyLevel

// Retrieve recommendations from Twitter using the TopicsLandingPageTopicRecommendations safety level
val recommendations = getRecommendations(safetyLevel = SafetyLevel.TopicsLandingPageTopicRecommendations)

// Display the recommendations on a landing page
displayRecommendations(recommendations)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code defines a sealed trait and two case objects for the SafetyLevel class, which likely represents different levels of safety for Twitter's follow recommendations. A smart developer might want to know how this class is used in other parts of the project and what functionality it provides.

2. What is the relationship between this code and the com.twitter.spam.rtf.thriftscala package?
- The code imports the SafetyLevel class from the com.twitter.spam.rtf.thriftscala package and uses an alias for the ThriftSafetyLevel enum. A smart developer might want to know how this package is related to the current project and why it is being used.

3. Are there any other SafetyLevel case objects that could be added in the future?
- The code currently defines two case objects for SafetyLevel, but it is possible that more could be added in the future. A smart developer might want to know if there are any plans to add additional case objects and how they would be implemented.
