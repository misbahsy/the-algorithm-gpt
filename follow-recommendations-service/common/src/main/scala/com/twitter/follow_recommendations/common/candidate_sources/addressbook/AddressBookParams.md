[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/candidate_sources/addressbook/AddressBookParams.scala)

The code defines an object called AddressBookParams that contains a nested object called ReadFromABV2Only. This object is used to set a configuration parameter for the Address Book feature in the Twitter application. 

The configuration parameter is a boolean value that determines whether the Address Book feature should only read from the ABV2 Client or also include data from Manhattan. The default value is false, meaning that data from both sources will be used. However, if the parameter is set to true, the Address Book feature will only read from the ABV2 Client and ignore Manhattan data.

This configuration parameter is used by display locations that want to customize the behavior of the Address Book feature. Currently, the only display location that uses this parameter is the ABUploadInjection DisplayLocation.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger Address Book feature in the Twitter application. By allowing display locations to customize the data sources used by the feature, it provides greater flexibility and control over how the feature is used. 

Example usage:

To set the configuration parameter to true and only read from the ABV2 Client, the following code can be used:

```
AddressBookParams.ReadFromABV2Only.set(true)
``` 

This will ensure that the Address Book feature only uses data from the ABV2 Client and ignores Manhattan data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code defines an object called AddressBookParams that contains a single boolean parameter used by display locations that want to read only from the ABV2 Client and ignore Manhattan. It likely fits into a larger system for generating follow recommendations based on user data.

2. What is the significance of the FSParam class and how is it used in this code?
- The FSParam class is likely a custom class used by the project to define parameters that can be set via a configuration file. In this code, it is used to define a boolean parameter with a default value of false.

3. Are there any other display locations besides ABUploadInjection that use the ReadFromABV2Only parameter?
- It is not clear from this code whether there are other display locations that use the ReadFromABV2Only parameter. Further investigation into the project's codebase or documentation may be necessary to determine this.
