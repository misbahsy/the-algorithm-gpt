The code above defines a class called MlRankerFSConfig, which extends the FeatureSwitchConfig class and is annotated with @Singleton and @Inject. This class is responsible for managing feature switches related to the machine learning (ML) ranking algorithm used in the Twitter follow recommendations system.

The FeatureSwitchConfig class provides a way to enable or disable certain features in a system without having to modify the code. This is useful for testing new features or turning off features that are causing issues. The MlRankerFSConfig class specifically deals with boolean feature switches, which are switches that can be either on or off.

The booleanFSParams field in the MlRankerFSConfig class is a sequence of FSParam[Boolean] objects. Each FSParam[Boolean] object represents a specific boolean feature switch and contains information such as the name of the switch and its default value. In this case, the only boolean feature switch defined is MlRankerParams.ScribeRankingInfoInMlRanker, which controls whether or not ranking information is sent to Scribe, a logging system used by Twitter.

Overall, the MlRankerFSConfig class is an important component of the Twitter follow recommendations system, as it allows for easy management of feature switches related to the ML ranking algorithm. Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
val mlRankerFSConfig = new MlRankerFSConfig()
if (mlRankerFSConfig.isEnabled(MlRankerParams.ScribeRankingInfoInMlRanker)) {
  // send ranking information to Scribe
} else {
  // do not send ranking information to Scribe
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a singleton class called `MlRankerFSConfig` that extends `FeatureSwitchConfig` and contains a sequence of boolean feature switch parameters for a machine learning ranker used in Twitter's follow recommendations system.

2. What is the significance of the `@Inject` and `@Singleton` annotations?
   - The `@Inject` annotation indicates that this class can be used as a dependency in other classes that require an instance of `FeatureSwitchConfig`. The `@Singleton` annotation ensures that only one instance of this class is created and shared across the application.

3. What is the meaning of `MlRankerParams.ScribeRankingInfoInMlRanker`?
   - `MlRankerParams.ScribeRankingInfoInMlRanker` is a boolean feature switch parameter that controls whether or not ranking information is logged to Scribe, a distributed logging system used at Twitter. If this parameter is set to `true`, ranking information will be logged.
