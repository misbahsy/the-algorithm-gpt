[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/common/candidate_sources/geo/PopGeohashSource.scala)

The code defines a class called PopGeohashSource that extends another class called BasePopGeohashSource. The purpose of this class is to provide candidate sources for a recommendation algorithm. The class takes in two parameters, popGeoSource and statsReceiver, and is annotated with @Singleton to ensure that only one instance of the class is created.

The class overrides several methods from the BasePopGeohashSource class to customize its behavior for the specific needs of the recommendation algorithm. For example, the candidateSourceEnabled method always returns true, indicating that this candidate source should always be considered. The identifier method returns a CandidateSourceIdentifier object that identifies this candidate source as being based on the PopGeohash algorithm. The minGeohashLength, maxResults, and maxGeohashLength methods return values based on the target parameter passed in, which is used to customize the behavior of the recommendation algorithm.

The object PopGeohashSource defines a static variable called Identifier that is used to identify this candidate source as being based on the PopGeohash algorithm.

Overall, this code provides a candidate source for a recommendation algorithm that is based on the PopGeohash algorithm. The class can be used in the larger project by being included as a dependency and used to provide candidate sources for the recommendation algorithm. For example, the following code could be used to create a new instance of the PopGeohashSource class:

```
val popGeohashSource = new PopGeohashSource(popGeoSource, statsReceiver)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm that uses geohashes to identify popular locations. It provides a way to generate a list of recommended users to follow based on location.

2. What dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several dependencies including Google Guice for dependency injection, Twitter Finagle for stats reporting, and Twitter Hermit for the underlying algorithm.

3. How does this code determine the minimum and maximum geohash length and maximum number of results to return?
- The minimum geohash length is determined by the `PopGeoSourceGeoHashMinPrecision` parameter in the `target` object, while the maximum geohash length is determined by the `PopGeoSourceGeoHashMaxPrecision` parameter. The maximum number of results to return is determined by the `PopGeoSourceMaxResultsPerPrecision` parameter.
