The code above defines a trait called `HasRecentlyEngagedUserIds` which is used to represent a model that has a list of recently engaged user IDs. The trait has a single property called `recentlyEngagedUserIds` which is an optional sequence of `RecentlyEngagedUserId` objects. 

This trait can be used as a mixin in other classes or traits to add the `recentlyEngagedUserIds` property to them. For example, a class representing a user's profile could use this trait to store the IDs of other users that the user has recently engaged with. 

Here is an example of how this trait could be used in a class:

```scala
package com.twitter.follow_recommendations.user

import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.HasRecentlyEngagedUserIds
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.RecentlyEngagedUserId

case class UserProfile(id: String, name: String, recentlyEngagedUserIds: Option[Seq[RecentlyEngagedUserId]]) extends HasRecentlyEngagedUserIds
```

In the example above, the `UserProfile` class extends the `HasRecentlyEngagedUserIds` trait and includes the `recentlyEngagedUserIds` property. This allows instances of `UserProfile` to store the IDs of other users that the user has recently engaged with. 

Overall, this trait provides a simple and reusable way to add a list of recently engaged user IDs to different models in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HasRecentlyEngagedUserIds` trait?
- The `HasRecentlyEngagedUserIds` trait defines a component that has a `recentlyEngagedUserIds` property, which is an optional sequence of `RecentlyEngagedUserId` objects.

2. What is the data type of the `recentlyEngagedUserIds` property?
- The `recentlyEngagedUserIds` property is an `Option` type that contains a sequence of `RecentlyEngagedUserId` objects.

3. What is the significance of the `RecentlyEngagedUserId` object?
- The `RecentlyEngagedUserId` object likely represents a user ID that has recently engaged with a particular piece of content or activity on Twitter. The sequence of these objects can be used to make follow recommendations to users based on their recent engagement history.
