The `PopCountrySource` class is a candidate source for recommending Twitter users to follow based on their location. It is a part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

This class extends the `CandidateSource` class and overrides its `apply` method. The `apply` method takes a `target` object that has several traits mixed in, including `HasGeohashAndCountryCode` and `HasUserState`. The method first checks if the `target` object has a `countryCode` value in its `geohashAndCountryCode` field. If it does, the method checks if the `target` user is in a blacklisted state, defined in the `PopCountrySource` object. If the user is not blacklisted, the method calls the `popGeoSource` method with the country code appended to the string "country_" to get a sequence of candidate users. The method then maps over this sequence to add the `identifier` field to each candidate user and returns the resulting sequence wrapped in a `Stitch` object. If the `target` object does not have a `countryCode` value, the method increments a counter for missing country code values and returns `Stitch.Nil`.

The purpose of this class is to provide a source of candidate users to follow based on the country of the target user. It uses the `popGeoSource` method to get a sequence of candidate users based on the country code and applies the `identifier` field to each candidate user. The resulting sequence is then returned to be used in the larger recommendation algorithm. 

Example usage:
```
val popCountrySource = new PopCountrySource(popGeoSource, statsReceiver)
val target = new HasClientContext with HasParams with HasUserState with HasGeohashAndCountryCode {
  override val geohashAndCountryCode: Option[HasGeohashAndCountryCode#GeohashAndCountryCode] = Some(HasGeohashAndCountryCode.GeohashAndCountryCode("abc123", Some("US")))
  override val userState: Option[UserState] = Some(UserState.Normal)
}
val candidates = popCountrySource.apply(target).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm that recommends users to follow based on their location. It solves the problem of finding popular users to recommend based on the country of the target user.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several Twitter-specific libraries such as `core_workflows`, `finagle`, `hermit`, `product_mixer`, and `stitch`. It also has a dependency on the `javax.inject` library.

3. What is the significance of the `PopCountrySource` object and its properties?
- The `PopCountrySource` object contains properties such as `Identifier`, `MaxResults`, and `BlacklistedTargetUserStates` that are used by the `PopCountrySource` class. `Identifier` is used to identify the candidate source, `MaxResults` limits the number of results returned, and `BlacklistedTargetUserStates` contains a set of user states that are blacklisted from being recommended.
