The `RequestBuilderUserFetcher` class is responsible for fetching user data from Twitter's Gizmoduck service. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The class takes in three dependencies: `gizmoduck`, `statsReceiver`, and `decider`. `gizmoduck` is an instance of the Gizmoduck service, which is used to fetch user data. `statsReceiver` is an instance of the StatsReceiver class, which is used to collect and report metrics about the performance of the `fetchUser` method. `decider` is an instance of the Decider class, which is used to determine whether or not to enable the `fetchUser` method for a given user.

The `fetchUser` method takes an optional `userIdOpt` parameter, which is used to fetch user data for a specific user. If `userIdOpt` is `Some(userId)` and the `enableDecider` method returns `true` for that `userId`, the method fetches the user data using the `gizmoduck.getUserById` method. The `LookupContext` parameter passed to this method specifies the context in which the user data should be fetched. The fetched user data is then wrapped in an `Option` and returned as a `Stitch`.

If `userIdOpt` is `None` or the `enableDecider` method returns `false` for the given `userId`, the method returns `Stitch.None`.

The `enableDecider` method takes a `userId` parameter and uses the `decider` instance to determine whether or not to enable the `fetchUser` method for that user. It does this by calling the `isAvailable` method on the `decider` instance with a `DeciderKey` and a `SimpleRecipient` that represents the user.

Overall, the `RequestBuilderUserFetcher` class provides a way to fetch user data from the Gizmoduck service in a controlled and monitored way. It can be used in the larger project to fetch user data for various purposes, such as recommending users to follow or analyzing user behavior. Here is an example of how the `fetchUser` method might be used:

```
val userFetcher = new RequestBuilderUserFetcher(gizmoduck, statsReceiver, decider)
val userIdOpt: Option[Long] = Some(1234567890)
val userStitch: Stitch[Option[User]] = userFetcher.fetchUser(userIdOpt)
userStitch.foreach { userOpt =>
  userOpt.foreach { user =>
    // Do something with the fetched user data
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code is a Scala class that fetches a user from Gizmoduck based on their user ID. It solves the problem of retrieving user information for use in Twitter's follow recommendations feature.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on several libraries including `com.twitter.decider`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, `com.twitter.gizmoduck.thriftscala`, and `com.twitter.stitch`.
3. What is the role of the `Decider` object in this code?
   - The `Decider` object is used to determine whether or not to enable fetching a user in the request builder. It checks if the `DeciderKey.EnableFetchUserInRequestBuilder` is available for the given user ID and returns a boolean value.
