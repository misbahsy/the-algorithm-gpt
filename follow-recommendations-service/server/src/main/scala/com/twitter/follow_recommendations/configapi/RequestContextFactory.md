The `RequestContextFactory` class is used to build `RequestContext` objects that are used by the config API to determine the parameter overrides to apply to the request. The parameter overrides are determined per request by configurations that specify which feature switches, deciders, and A/B tests translate to what parameter overrides.

The `RequestContextFactory` class is a singleton class that takes in `FeatureSwitches` and `Decider` objects as constructor arguments. It has a public `apply` method that takes in a `ClientContext` object, a `DisplayLocation` object, and a `Map` of feature overrides, and returns a `RequestContext` object. The `RequestContext` object contains the user ID, guest ID, and feature context.

The `getFeatureContext` method is a private method that takes in a `ClientContext` object, a `DisplayLocation` object, and a `Map` of feature overrides, and returns a `FeatureContext` object. The `FeatureContext` object is created by combining the forced feature context and the feature switch results feature context. The forced feature context is created from the feature overrides, and the feature switch results feature context is created by matching the feature switch recipient with the feature switches.

The `getFeatureSwitchRecipient` method is a private method that takes in a `ClientContext` object and returns a `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object. The `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object contains the user ID, user roles, device ID, guest ID, language code, country code, verification status, client application ID, and twoffice status.

This class is used in the larger project to determine the parameter overrides to apply to the request based on the feature switches, deciders, and A/B tests. The `RequestContextFactory` class is a key component of the config API that enables the project to dynamically configure its behavior based on various factors such as user ID, guest ID, device ID, language code, country code, and more. Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```
val clientContext = ClientContext(userId = Some(123456), guestId = Some(789012), appId = Some("myApp"))
val displayLocation = DisplayLocation("timeline")
val featureOverrides = Map("myFeature" -> FeatureValue("on"))
val requestContextFactory = new RequestContextFactory(featureSwitches, decider)
val requestContext = requestContextFactory(clientContext, displayLocation, featureOverrides)
```

In this example, a `ClientContext` object is created with a user ID of 123456, a guest ID of 789012, and an app ID of "myApp". A `DisplayLocation` object is created with a value of "timeline". A `Map` of feature overrides is created with a key of "myFeature" and a value of "on". A `RequestContextFactory` object is created with the `FeatureSwitches` and `Decider` objects. Finally, a `RequestContext` object is created by calling the `apply` method of the `RequestContextFactory` object with the `ClientContext`, `DisplayLocation`, and `featureOverrides` objects. The resulting `RequestContext` object contains the user ID, guest ID, and feature context that can be used to determine the parameter overrides to apply to the request.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?
- This code is a RequestContextFactory used to build RequestContext objects for the config api to determine parameter overrides for requests based on feature switches, deciders, and AB tests.
2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they used?
- This code has dependencies on various classes from different packages, such as FeatureSwitches and Decider from com.twitter.decider, and DisplayLocation from com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models. These dependencies are used to build the RequestContext object.
3. What is the significance of the @Singleton and @VisibleForTesting annotations?
- The @Singleton annotation indicates that there should only be one instance of this class created and used throughout the project. The @VisibleForTesting annotation indicates that the getFeatureSwitchRecipient method is only intended to be used for testing purposes and should not be accessed outside of testing.
