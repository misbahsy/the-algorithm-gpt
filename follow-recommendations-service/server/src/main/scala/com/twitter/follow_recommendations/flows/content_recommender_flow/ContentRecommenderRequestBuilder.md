The `ContentRecommenderRequestBuilder` class is responsible for building a `ContentRecommenderRequest` object from a `ProductRequest` object. The `ContentRecommenderRequest` object is used to make recommendations for content to users based on their recent activity and location. 

The `ContentRecommenderRequestBuilder` class has a constructor that takes in three clients (`SocialGraphClient`, `UserLocationFetcher`, and `UserStateClient`) and a `StatsReceiver` object. The `StatsReceiver` object is used to collect statistics about the performance of the code.

The `build` method takes in a `ProductRequest` object and returns a `Stitch[ContentRecommenderRequest]` object. The `Stitch` object is a monadic data structure that allows for the composition of asynchronous operations. 

The `build` method first creates a `Stitch` object that collects the user state for the user specified in the `ProductRequest` object. It then creates a `Stitch` object that collects the recent followed user IDs for the user specified in the `ProductRequest` object. If the `GetFollowersFromSgs` parameter is set to true, it also creates a `Stitch` object that collects the recent followed by user IDs for the user specified in the `ProductRequest` object. If the `EnableInvalidRelationshipPredicate` parameter is set to true, it creates a `Stitch` object that collects the invalid relationship user IDs for the user specified in the `ProductRequest` object. Finally, it creates a `Stitch` object that collects the location for the user specified in the `ProductRequest` object.

The `Stitch` objects are then joined together using the `join` method. The `join` method takes in multiple `Stitch` objects and returns a new `Stitch` object that contains the results of all the `Stitch` objects. The `map` method is then called on the resulting `Stitch` object to create a new `ContentRecommenderRequest` object.

The `ContentRecommenderRequest` object contains information about the user's recent activity, location, and user state. This information is used to make recommendations for content to the user.

Example usage:

```scala
val builder = new ContentRecommenderRequestBuilder(
  socialGraphClient,
  userLocationFetcher,
  userStateClient,
  statsReceiver
)

val productRequest = ProductRequest(
  params = Map(
    ContentRecommenderParams.RecentFollowingPredicateBudgetInMillisecond -> 1000,
    ContentRecommenderParams.GetFollowersFromSgs -> true,
    ContentRecommenderParams.EnableInvalidRelationshipPredicate -> true
  ),
  recommendationRequest = RecommendationRequest(
    clientContext = ClientContext(
      userId = Some(1234),
      ipAddress = Some("127.0.0.1")
    ),
    excludedIds = Some(Seq(5678)),
    displayLocation = Some("US"),
    maxResults = Some(10),
    debugParams = Some(DebugParams(debugOptions = Some(Seq("debug1", "debug2"))))
  )
)

val contentRecommenderRequest = builder.build(productRequest).get()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a request builder for a content recommender flow in a Twitter project. It collects various user data such as recent followed and followed-by user IDs, user location, and user state to build a ContentRecommenderRequest object.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has external dependencies on several Twitter libraries such as `com.twitter.conversions.DurationOps`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.geoduck.UserLocationFetcher`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.socialgraph.SocialGraphClient`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.clients.user_state.UserStateClient`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.utils.RescueWithStatsUtils`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.products.common.ProductRequest`, and `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`.

3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor of this class as the one to be used by the dependency injection framework to provide the necessary dependencies for this class.
