[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/services/exceptions/UnknownExceptionMapper.scala)

The code is a part of the Twitter Follow Recommendations service and is responsible for handling unknown exceptions that may occur during the execution of the service. The purpose of this code is to log the details of the exception and return it to the caller. 

The code defines a class called UnknownLoggingExceptionMapper which extends the ExceptionMapper class provided by the Finatra Thrift framework. The ExceptionMapper class is used to map exceptions to a specific response. In this case, the UnknownLoggingExceptionMapper class maps any unknown exception to a Throwable object. 

The class is annotated with the @Singleton annotation which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. 

The class has a single method called handleException which takes an Exception object as input and returns a Future[Throwable] object. The method logs the details of the exception using the error method provided by the Logging trait. The error method logs the message and stack trace of the exception. 

Finally, the method returns a Future object that wraps the original exception. This means that the caller of the service will receive the original exception along with the details logged by this code. 

This code is an important part of the Twitter Follow Recommendations service as it ensures that any unknown exceptions are logged and returned to the caller. This helps in debugging and troubleshooting any issues that may occur during the execution of the service. 

Example usage:

```scala
try {
  // code that may throw an exception
} catch {
  case e: Exception => 
    val exceptionMapper = new UnknownLoggingExceptionMapper()
    val futureThrowable = exceptionMapper.handleException(e)
    futureThrowable.onFailure { throwable =>
      // handle the exception
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    - This code is an implementation of an exception mapper for the Twitter Finatra Thrift framework.
2. What type of exceptions does this mapper handle?
    - This mapper handles all exceptions that extend the base Exception class.
3. How does this mapper handle exceptions?
    - This mapper logs the exception message and stack trace at the error level and returns a Future containing the original exception.
