The `CandidateUserParamsFactory` class is used to create `CandidateUser` objects with parameters for experiments on the "producer side". It takes in a `Config` object, a `CandidateUserContextFactory` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. 

The `apply` method takes in a `CandidateUser` object and a request of type `T` which must have parameters and a display location. If the `CandidateUser` object has invalid parameters, the method checks if the `EnableCandidateParamHydrations` parameter is set to true in the `GlobalParams` object of the request. If it is, the method creates a new `CandidateUser` object with parameters obtained from the `Config` object using the `CandidateUserContextFactory` object and the display location from the request. If it is not, the method creates a new `CandidateUser` object with empty parameters. If the `CandidateUser` object already has valid parameters, the method returns the same object.

This class is used in the larger project to create `CandidateUser` objects with parameters for experiments on the "producer side". The `Config` object is used to obtain the parameters for the `CandidateUser` object, and the `StatsReceiver` object is used to track statistics related to the creation of these objects. The `CandidateUserContextFactory` object is used to create a context for the `CandidateUser` object, which is used to obtain the parameters from the `Config` object. 

Example usage:
```
val config = new Config()
val candidateContextFactory = new CandidateUserContextFactory()
val statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()

val factory = new CandidateUserParamsFactory(config, candidateContextFactory, statsReceiver)

val candidate = new CandidateUser()
val request = new Request(params = new GlobalParams(EnableCandidateParamHydrations = true), displayLocation = "homepage")

val candidateWithParams = factory(candidate, request)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a singleton class called `CandidateUserParamsFactory` that is used for "producer side" experiments and is responsible for applying candidate user parameters to a given candidate user object based on the request and configuration.
2. What are the dependencies of this code?
   - This code depends on several other packages and classes, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.CandidateUser`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.HasDisplayLocation`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.params.GlobalParams`, `com.twitter.servo.util.MemoizingStatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.timelines.configapi.Config`, `com.twitter.timelines.configapi.HasParams`, `com.twitter.timelines.configapi.Params`, `javax.inject.Inject`, and `javax.inject.Singleton`.
3. What is the purpose of the `MemoizingStatsReceiver` class and how is it used in this code?
   - The `MemoizingStatsReceiver` class is used to memoize (cache) the results of a given function call so that subsequent calls with the same arguments can be returned from the cache instead of being recomputed. In this code, a new instance of `MemoizingStatsReceiver` is created with a scope of "configapi_candidate_params" and is used to wrap the `StatsReceiver` passed in as a parameter to the `CandidateUserParamsFactory` constructor. The memoized stats receiver is then used to store statistics related to the configuration API candidate parameters.
