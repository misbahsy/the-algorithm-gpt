The `PostNuxMlRequestBuilder` class is responsible for building a `PostNuxMlRequest` object, which is used to make recommendations for users to follow on Twitter after they have completed the new user experience (NUX). The class takes in several dependencies, including clients for accessing user data such as the social graph, interests, and user state, as well as a stats receiver for collecting metrics.

The `build` method takes in a `ProductRequest` object, which contains information about the user making the request and any parameters for the recommendation algorithm. The method then uses the dependencies to collect data about the user, such as recent followed and dismissed users, invalid relationship users, and topic interests. This data is collected asynchronously using the `Stitch` library, which allows for parallel execution of multiple requests.

Once all the data has been collected, the method constructs a `PostNuxMlRequest` object using the collected data and the parameters from the `ProductRequest`. This object is then returned as a `Stitch` object, which allows for asynchronous processing of the recommendation request.

Overall, the `PostNuxMlRequestBuilder` class is a key component of the recommendation algorithm for Twitter's NUX experience. It collects user data from various sources and constructs a request object that is used to generate recommendations for users to follow.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a request builder for a post-NUX machine learning algorithm that recommends Twitter users to follow. It fetches various user data from different clients and services to build a request for the algorithm.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `build` method?
- The `build` method takes in a `ProductRequest` object, which contains information about the recommendation request, and two optional sets of previously recommended and followed user IDs. It outputs a `Stitch` object that eventually resolves to a `PostNuxMlRequest` object, which contains the data needed for the recommendation algorithm.

3. What are some potential issues or limitations with this code?
- It's unclear what happens if any of the data fetching operations fail. The code also assumes that the `ProductRequest` object always contains certain parameters, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the code could benefit from more comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each component.
