The `ConfigBuilder` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for building a configuration object that is used to determine which rules to apply when making follow recommendations. The configuration object is built using two other configuration objects: `DeciderConfigs` and `FeatureSwitchConfigs`. 

The `ConfigBuilder` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire application. This is useful for performance reasons, as creating multiple instances of this class can be expensive.

The `build()` method of the `ConfigBuilder` class creates a new `CompositeConfig` object, which is a composite of the `DeciderConfigs` and `FeatureSwitchConfigs` objects. The order of the configs added to the `CompositeConfig` is important, as the config will be matched with the first possible rule. In the current setup, priority is given to `Deciders` instead of `FS`.

Here is an example of how the `ConfigBuilder` class may be used in the larger project:

```scala
val deciderConfigs = new DeciderConfigs(...)
val featureSwitchConfigs = new FeatureSwitchConfigs(...)
val configBuilder = new ConfigBuilder(deciderConfigs, featureSwitchConfigs)
val config = configBuilder.build()

// Use the config object to determine which rules to apply when making follow recommendations
```

Overall, the `ConfigBuilder` class plays an important role in the follow recommendation process by providing a configuration object that determines which rules to apply.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is for building a configuration object for follow recommendations on Twitter, using a composite of decider and feature switch configurations.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `DeciderConfigs` and `FeatureSwitchConfigs` classes from the `com.twitter.timelines.configapi` package, as well as the `javax.inject` package.

3. How does the order of configs added to `CompositeConfig` affect the behavior of the program?
   - The order of configs added to `CompositeConfig` determines the priority of the rules. In this case, deciders have priority over feature switches because they are added first.
