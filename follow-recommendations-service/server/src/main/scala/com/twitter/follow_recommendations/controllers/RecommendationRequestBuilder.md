The `RecommendationRequestBuilder` class is responsible for building a `RecommendationRequest` object from a Thrift `RecommendationRequest` object. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves recommending content to users based on various factors.

The `RecommendationRequest` object contains information about the user making the request, the location and context of the request, and various parameters for the recommendation algorithm. The `fromThrift` method takes in a Thrift `RecommendationRequest` object and returns a `Stitch` object that eventually resolves to a `RecommendationRequest` object.

The `requestBuilderUserFetcher` object is used to fetch information about the user making the request. If the user is a "soft" user (as determined by their `UserType`), the `isSoftUserCounter` is incremented. The `ClientContextConverter` and `DisplayLocation` objects are used to convert the Thrift objects to their corresponding Scala objects.

The `maxResults`, `cursor`, `excludedIds`, `fetchPromotedContent`, `debugParams`, `userLocationState`, and `isSoftUser` fields of the `RecommendationRequest` object are set based on the corresponding fields in the Thrift `RecommendationRequest` object.

Overall, this class plays an important role in the recommendation algorithm by converting Thrift objects to Scala objects and fetching user information. It allows the recommendation algorithm to be modular and easily extensible. Here is an example usage of this class:

```
val thriftRequest: t.RecommendationRequest = // create a Thrift RecommendationRequest object
val builder = new RecommendationRequestBuilder(requestBuilderUserFetcher, statsReceiver)
val stitch: Stitch[RecommendationRequest] = builder.fromThrift(thriftRequest)
stitch.onSuccess { recommendationRequest =>
  // use the RecommendationRequest object to make recommendations
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a Scala class called RecommendationRequestBuilder that takes a Thrift RecommendationRequest and returns a Stitch RecommendationRequest. It fetches user information and converts Thrift objects to Scala objects.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.gizmoduck.thriftscala.UserType, com.twitter.stitch.Stitch, javax.inject.Inject, and javax.inject.Singleton.

3. What is the significance of the isSoftUserCounter and how is it used?
- The isSoftUserCounter is a counter that increments every time a user is identified as a "soft" user. It is used to track the number of soft users in the system and is scoped to the RecommendationRequestBuilder class.
