This code defines a set of classes and traits related to social proof and social text for a project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The `SocialProof` trait is a sealed trait, which means that all of its implementations must be defined in the same file. It is used to represent different types of social proof, which are pieces of evidence that suggest that a particular action (such as following a user) is a good idea because other people have done it. 

The two implementations of `SocialProof` are `GeoContextProof` and `FollowedByUsersProof`. `GeoContextProof` takes a single argument, `popularInCountryText`, which is an `ExternalString` object. This object likely contains a string that describes the popularity of a particular user or topic in a specific country. `FollowedByUsersProof` takes one or more `ExternalString` objects as arguments, which likely contain strings that describe the number or types of users who are following a particular user. 

The `SocialText` trait is also a sealed trait and is used to represent the text associated with a particular piece of social proof. The two implementations of `SocialText` are `GeoSocialText` and `FollowedByUsersText`, which both take a single argument, `text`, which is a string that contains the actual text of the social proof. 

Overall, this code provides a framework for representing and manipulating different types of social proof and social text within the larger project. For example, other parts of the project may use these classes to generate recommendations for users to follow based on the social proof associated with different accounts. 

Example usage:

```
val geoProof = GeoContextProof(ExternalString("Popular in the US"))
val followedByProof = FollowedByUsersProof(ExternalString("Followed by 100k users"), ExternalString("Followed by verified users"))
val geoText = GeoSocialText("This account is popular in the US")
val followedByText = FollowedByUsersText("This account is followed by 100k users and verified users")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SocialProof` trait and its two case classes `GeoContextProof` and `FollowedByUsersProof`?
- The `SocialProof` trait is used to define a type hierarchy for different types of social proof. `GeoContextProof` represents social proof based on popularity in a specific country, while `FollowedByUsersProof` represents social proof based on being followed by other users.
 
2. What is the purpose of the `SocialText` trait and its two case classes `GeoSocialText` and `FollowedByUsersText`?
- The `SocialText` trait is used to define a type hierarchy for different types of social text. `GeoSocialText` represents social text related to a specific location, while `FollowedByUsersText` represents social text related to being followed by other users.

3. What is the significance of the `ExternalString` type used in the `GeoContextProof` and `FollowedByUsersProof` case classes?
- The `ExternalString` type is used to represent a string that is stored externally and can be retrieved when needed. This can be useful for optimizing memory usage and reducing duplication of string data.
