The code defines a utility class and an object that are used to filter candidate sources for a recommendation system. The recommendation system is designed to suggest Twitter users to follow based on various sources such as social graph, recent engagement, and geographic location. 

The `CandidateSourceHoldbackUtil` trait defines a method `filterCandidateSources` that takes a request object and a sequence of candidate sources as input and returns a filtered sequence of candidate sources. The `request` object is expected to have a parameter `GlobalParams.CandidateSourcesToFilter` that specifies the type of candidate sources to filter. The `sources` sequence is filtered based on the type of candidate sources specified in the `request` parameter. 

The `CandidateSourceHoldbackUtil` object defines three sets of candidate source identifiers: `ContextualActivityCandidateSourceIds`, `SocialCandidateSourceIds`, and `GeoCandidateSourceIds`. These sets are used to map candidate source types to their respective identifiers. The `CandidateSourceTypeToMap` map is used to map candidate source types to their respective sets of identifiers. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to filter candidate sources based on their type. This is useful in the larger recommendation system because it allows for more control over which sources are used to generate recommendations. For example, if the recommendation system is designed to only suggest users based on social graph information, the `CandidateSourceTypeToMap` can be used to filter out all other types of candidate sources. 

Here is an example of how the `filterCandidateSources` method can be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.follow_recommendations.utils.CandidateSourceHoldbackUtil

val request = // create a request object with GlobalParams.CandidateSourcesToFilter parameter
val sources = // create a sequence of candidate sources

val filteredSources = CandidateSourceHoldbackUtil.filterCandidateSources(request, sources)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a utility trait and object for filtering candidate sources based on their type (social, activity contextual, or geo and interests) and specific identifiers.
2. What are the different types of candidate sources that can be filtered using this code?
   - The different types of candidate sources that can be filtered are social, activity contextual, and geo and interests.
3. How are candidate sources filtered using this code?
   - Candidate sources are filtered by checking their identifier against a set of identifiers for the corresponding type of candidate source to filter. If the identifier is in the set, the candidate source is filtered out.
