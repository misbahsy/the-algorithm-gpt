The code provided is a Scala implementation of an abstract class called `ProductException` and a concrete class called `MissingFieldException`. The purpose of these classes is to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the recommendation algorithm in the larger project.

The `ProductException` class is an abstract class that extends the built-in `Exception` class in Scala. It takes a single parameter, `message`, which is a string that represents the error message associated with the exception. This class is meant to be extended by other exception classes in the project that may have specific error messages.

The `MissingFieldException` class is a concrete class that extends the `ProductException` class. It takes two parameters: `productRequest`, which is an instance of the `ProductRequest` class, and `fieldName`, which is a string representing the name of the missing field. This class is used to handle exceptions that occur when a required field is missing from a `ProductRequest` instance.

The `MissingFieldException` class overrides the `message` parameter of the `ProductException` class to provide a more specific error message. The error message includes the name of the missing field and the display location of the recommendation request associated with the `ProductRequest` instance.

Here is an example of how the `MissingFieldException` class may be used in the larger project:

```
try {
  // code that creates a ProductRequest instance
} catch {
  case e: MissingFieldException => println(e.getMessage)
}
```

In this example, if a `MissingFieldException` is thrown during the creation of a `ProductRequest` instance, the error message associated with the exception will be printed to the console. This allows the developer to quickly identify and fix the issue.

Overall, the purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of handling exceptions related to missing fields in `ProductRequest` instances. By using the `ProductException` and `MissingFieldException` classes, the larger project can ensure that exceptions are handled consistently and with informative error messages.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProductException` class?
- The `ProductException` class is an abstract class that extends the `Exception` class and is likely used as a base class for other exception classes in the project.

2. What is the `MissingFieldException` class used for?
- The `MissingFieldException` class is used to represent an exception that occurs when a required field is missing from a `ProductRequest` object, and includes information about the missing field and the display location of the request.

3. What is the `ProductRequest` class and what other classes might use it?
- The code snippet does not provide information about the `ProductRequest` class, but it is likely a class used to represent a request for a product recommendation. Other classes in the project that might use it could include recommendation engines or data processing classes.
