The `RecommendationsService` class is a singleton service that provides a method for getting recommendations based on a `RecommendationRequest` and `Params`. It takes in two dependencies, `productRecommenderService` and `resultLogger`, which are instances of `ProductRecommenderService` and `FrsLogger`, respectively.

The `get` method first checks if the `EnableRecommendations` parameter is set to true in the `params` object. If it is, it calls the `getRecommendations` method on the `productRecommenderService` instance, passing in the `request` and `params` objects. The result of this call is then mapped to a `RecommendationResponse` object and wrapped in a `Stitch` instance. If the `shouldLog` method on the `resultLogger` instance returns true for the `debugParams` of the `request`, the `logRecommendationResult` method is called on the `resultLogger` instance, passing in the `request` and `response` objects.

If the `EnableRecommendations` parameter is not set to true, the `get` method returns a `Stitch` instance containing an empty `RecommendationResponse`.

This code is likely part of a larger project that involves recommending products to users based on various parameters. The `RecommendationRequest` and `Params` objects likely contain information about the user and their preferences, while the `ProductRecommenderService` is responsible for actually generating the recommendations. The `FrsLogger` instance is likely used for logging recommendation results for analysis and debugging purposes. Overall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to get recommendations based on user input. 

Example usage:

```
val request = RecommendationRequest(user = "john_doe", preferences = List("sports", "music"))
val params = Params(Map(DeciderParams.EnableRecommendations -> true))
val service = new RecommendationsService(productRecommenderService, resultLogger)
val result = service.get(request, params).run()
println(result)
// Output: RecommendationResponse(List(Product1, Product2, Product3))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a `RecommendationsService` class that provides a method to get recommendations based on a `RecommendationRequest` and `Params` object, using a `ProductRecommenderService`. It also logs the recommendation result using a `FrsLogger`.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.deciders.DeciderParams`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.logging.FrsLogger`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.models.RecommendationRequest`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.models.RecommendationResponse`, `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch`, and `com.twitter.timelines.configapi.Params`.
3. What is the purpose of the `if` statement in the `get` method?
   - The `if` statement checks if the `DeciderParams.EnableRecommendations` parameter is set to true in the `params` object. If it is, the method calls the `getRecommendations` method of the `productRecommenderService` and maps the result to a `RecommendationResponse`. If not, it returns an empty `RecommendationResponse`.
