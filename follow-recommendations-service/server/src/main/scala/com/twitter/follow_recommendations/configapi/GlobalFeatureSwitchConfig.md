[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/follow-recommendations-service/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/follow_recommendations/configapi/GlobalFeatureSwitchConfig.scala)

The code defines a class called GlobalFeatureSwitchConfig that extends a FeatureSwitchConfig class. The purpose of this class is to provide a configuration for feature switches that control the behavior of the recommendation algorithm used by Twitter. 

The class contains three lists of parameters: booleanFSParams, enumFsParams, and enumSeqFsParams. The booleanFSParams list contains boolean parameters that can be turned on or off to enable or disable certain features of the recommendation algorithm. These parameters include EnableCandidateParamHydrations, KeepUserCandidate, KeepSocialUserCandidate, EnableGFSSocialProofTransform, EnableWhoToFollowProducts, and EnableRecommendationFlowLogs. 

The enumFsParams list contains enumerated parameters that specify the type of aggregator to use for certain parts of the recommendation algorithm. These parameters include CandidateScorerIdParam, SimsExpansionSourceParams.Aggregator, RecentEngagementSimilarUsersParams.Aggregator, and CandidateSourcesToFilter. 

The enumSeqFsParams list contains enumerated parameters that specify the filtering and ranking logic to use for certain parts of the recommendation algorithm. These parameters include AccountsFilteringAndRankingLogics and OrganicAccountsFilteringAndRankingLogics. 

Overall, this class provides a way to configure the feature switches for the recommendation algorithm used by Twitter. By enabling or disabling certain features and specifying the type of aggregator and filtering and ranking logic to use, the algorithm can be customized to better suit the needs of the platform and its users. 

Example usage:

```
val config = new GlobalFeatureSwitchConfig()
config.booleanFSParams.foreach(param => println(param.name + ": " + param.value))
config.enumFsParams.foreach(param => println(param.name + ": " + param.value))
config.enumSeqFsParams.foreach(param => println(param.name + ": " + param.value))
```

This code creates a new instance of the GlobalFeatureSwitchConfig class and prints out the values of all the boolean, enumerated, and enumerated sequence parameters defined in the class. This can be used to verify that the configuration is set up correctly and to debug any issues with the feature switches.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a class called `GlobalFeatureSwitchConfig` that extends `FeatureSwitchConfig` and contains various boolean, enum, and enum sequence parameters related to candidate sources, social proof transformation, and recommendation flow logs.

2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.common`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.params`, `com.twitter.timelines.configapi`, `javax.inject`, and `javax.inject.Singleton`.

3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations in this code?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the `GlobalFeatureSwitchConfig` class should be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor of the class as eligible for dependency injection, which means that an instance of this class can be automatically created and provided by a dependency injection framework.
