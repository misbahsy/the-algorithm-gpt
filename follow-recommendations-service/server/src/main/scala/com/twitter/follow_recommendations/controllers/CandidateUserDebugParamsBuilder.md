The `CandidateUserDebugParamsBuilder` class is responsible for building `CandidateUserDebugParams` objects from Thrift requests. This class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is located in the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.controllers` package.

The `CandidateUserDebugParams` object is used to store debug information about a candidate user, including their user ID and feature values. The `CandidateUserDebugParamsBuilder` class takes a Thrift request as input and converts it into a `CandidateUserDebugParams` object.

The `fromThrift` method takes a `ScoringUserRequest` object as input and returns a `CandidateUserDebugParams` object. The `ScoringUserRequest` object contains information about the user and their context, including their client context and display location. The `fromThrift` method uses the `ClientContextConverter` and `DisplayLocation` classes to convert these objects from Thrift format to Scala format.

The `fromThrift` method then iterates over the list of candidate users in the request and builds a map of user IDs to `Params` objects. The `Params` object contains information about the user's features and their values. The `paramsFactory` method is used to create the `Params` object for each candidate user.

Here is an example of how the `CandidateUserDebugParamsBuilder` class can be used:

```scala
val builder = new CandidateUserDebugParamsBuilder(new ParamsFactory())
val request = // create a ScoringUserRequest object
val params = builder.fromThrift(request)
// use the params object for debugging or analysis
```

Overall, the `CandidateUserDebugParamsBuilder` class plays an important role in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project by providing a way to extract debug information about candidate users from Thrift requests.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that builds candidate user debug parameters for a Twitter follow recommendations system. It takes in a request in Thrift format and converts it to a set of debug parameters using various helper functions and classes.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code imports several classes and packages from other modules, including `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.ParamsFactory`, and `javax.inject`. It also depends on the `thriftscala` module for the `t.ScoringUserRequest` class.
3. What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?
   - The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that this class should be instantiated only once and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor parameter `paramsFactory` as a dependency that should be automatically injected by a dependency injection framework.
