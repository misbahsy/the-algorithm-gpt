The `ScoringUserRequestBuilder` class is responsible for building a `ScoringUserRequest` object from a `ScoringUserRequest` Thrift object. This class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to generate scoring requests for candidate users. 

The `ScoringUserRequest` object contains information about the client context, display location, parameters, debug options, recent followed user IDs, recent followed by user IDs, wtf impressions, similar to user IDs, candidates, debug parameters, and whether the user is a soft user. 

The `fromThrift` method takes a `ScoringUserRequest` Thrift object as input and returns a `ScoringUserRequest` object. The method first fetches the user associated with the client context ID using the `requestBuilderUserFetcher` object. If the user is a soft user, the `isSoftUserCounter` counter is incremented. 

The method then uses the `candidateUserDebugParamsBuilder` object to generate a map of candidate user parameters. It then iterates over the candidate users in the Thrift object and creates a `CandidateUser` object for each candidate. The `params` field of the `CandidateUser` object is set to the corresponding parameter value from the map generated earlier. 

Finally, the method creates a `ScoringUserRequest` object using the information from the Thrift object and the `CandidateUser` objects. The `ScoringUserRequest` object is returned. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val scoringUserRequestBuilder = new ScoringUserRequestBuilder(requestBuilderUserFetcher, candidateUserDebugParamsBuilder, statsReceiver)
val scoringUserRequest = scoringUserRequestBuilder.fromThrift(thriftScoringUserRequest)
val scoringResult = scoringAlgorithm.score(scoringUserRequest)
``` 

In this example, a `ScoringUserRequestBuilder` object is created with the necessary dependencies. The `fromThrift` method is then called with a `ScoringUserRequest` Thrift object to generate a `ScoringUserRequest` object. Finally, the `ScoringUserRequest` object is passed to a scoring algorithm to generate a scoring result.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the ScoringUserRequestBuilder class?
- The ScoringUserRequestBuilder class is responsible for building a ScoringUserRequest object from a Thrift ScoringUserRequest object, using various other objects and parameters.

2. What external libraries or frameworks does this code use?
- This code uses the Finagle, Gizmoduck, and Stitch libraries, as well as the Thrift protocol.

3. What is the significance of the isSoftUserCounter metric?
- The isSoftUserCounter metric is used to count the number of times a user is identified as a "soft" user, which may be useful for tracking and analysis purposes.
