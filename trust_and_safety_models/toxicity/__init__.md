The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words` which takes in a string of text and returns a list of the most common words in the text. The function first removes any punctuation and converts all characters to lowercase. It then splits the text into individual words and creates a dictionary where each key is a unique word and the value is the number of times that word appears in the text. The function then sorts the dictionary by value in descending order and returns a list of the top n words, where n is specified by the user.

This function can be used in a larger project that involves analyzing text data, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling. For example, if the project involves analyzing customer reviews of a product, this function can be used to identify the most commonly used words in the reviews, which can provide insights into the features or issues that customers care about the most. 

Here is an example of how to use the `find_most_common_words` function:

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox, but the fox keeps running."
common_words = find_most_common_words(text, 3)
print(common_words)
```

Output:
```
['the', 'fox', 'dog']
```

In this example, the function returns a list of the top 3 most common words in the text, which are 'the', 'fox', and 'dog'.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_tweet_sentiment` function?
- The `get_tweet_sentiment` function is used to analyze the sentiment of a given tweet and return a string indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

2. What is the significance of the `stopwords` variable?
- The `stopwords` variable contains a list of common words that are typically filtered out of text analysis to improve accuracy. It is used in the `clean_tweet` function to remove these words from the tweet before sentiment analysis.

3. How does the `sentiment_analyzer` object work?
- The `sentiment_analyzer` object is an instance of the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` class from the `nltk` library. It uses a pre-trained model to analyze the sentiment of a given text and return a dictionary of scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. The `get_tweet_sentiment` function uses this object to analyze the sentiment of a tweet.
