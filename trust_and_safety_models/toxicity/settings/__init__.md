The code provided is a Python implementation of the QuickSort algorithm. QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array or list of elements. The algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted using the same process until the entire array is sorted.

The implementation provided in this code file consists of a single function called `quick_sort`. This function takes an array of elements as input and returns the sorted array. The function first checks if the length of the array is less than or equal to 1, in which case it simply returns the array. Otherwise, it selects the last element of the array as the pivot and partitions the array into two sub-arrays using a loop. The loop iterates over the elements of the array from the first to the second-to-last element, and for each element, it compares it to the pivot. If the element is less than the pivot, it is swapped with the element at the current partition index, and the partition index is incremented. After the loop completes, the pivot is swapped with the element at the partition index, effectively placing the pivot in its final sorted position. The function then recursively calls itself on the two sub-arrays to sort them, and concatenates the sorted sub-arrays with the pivot element to produce the final sorted array.

This implementation of QuickSort can be used in a larger project that requires sorting of arrays or lists of elements. For example, it could be used in a data processing pipeline to sort data before performing further analysis or processing. Here is an example usage of the `quick_sort` function:

```
unsorted_array = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
sorted_array = quick_sort(unsorted_array)
print(sorted_array) # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_tweet_sentiment` function?
   - The `get_tweet_sentiment` function is used to analyze the sentiment of a given tweet and return a string indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

2. What is the significance of the `stopwords` variable?
   - The `stopwords` variable contains a list of common words that are often excluded from text analysis because they do not carry significant meaning. This list is used to filter out these words from the tweet before sentiment analysis is performed.

3. How is the `TextBlob` library used in this code?
   - The `TextBlob` library is used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweet text. The `TextBlob` object is created with the tweet text as input, and the `sentiment` property of the object is used to determine the polarity and subjectivity of the text.
