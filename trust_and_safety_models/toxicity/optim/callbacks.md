This file contains several classes that are used as callbacks in a TensorFlow Keras model. These callbacks are used to perform additional actions during the training process, such as logging metrics, stopping training early, and syncing logs to a remote server. 

The `NothingCallback` class is a simple callback that prints messages at the beginning and end of each epoch and at the end of each batch. This is likely used for debugging purposes.

The `ControlledStoppingCheckpointCallback` class is a subclass of `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` that stops training after a specified number of epochs. This is useful for preventing overfitting and saving time during training.

The `SyncingTensorBoard` class is a subclass of `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` that syncs the logs to a remote server using the `gsutil` command-line tool. This is useful for keeping track of training progress across multiple machines.

The `GradientLoggingTensorBoard` class is a subclass of `SyncingTensorBoard` that logs the gradient norm of the model's trainable weights at a specified frequency. This is useful for monitoring the stability of the training process and detecting issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients.

The `AdditionalResultLogger` class is a callback that logs additional evaluation metrics during training. It supports binary and multiclass classification tasks, and can handle models with multiple outputs. The metrics logged include precision-recall curves, PR AUC, and ROC AUC. This is useful for monitoring the performance of the model during training and selecting the best hyperparameters.

Overall, these callbacks are used to enhance the functionality of the TensorFlow Keras model and provide additional insights into the training process. They are likely used in conjunction with other components of the larger project, such as data preprocessing and model architecture. 

Example usage of the `AdditionalResultLogger` class:

```python
from toxicity_ml_pipeline.utils.absv_utils import load_data
from toxicity_ml_pipeline.models.bert import BertModel
from toxicity_ml_pipeline.callbacks import AdditionalResultLogger

train_data = load_data("train")
val_data = load_data("val")

model = BertModel()
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

result_logger = AdditionalResultLogger(data=val_data, set_="validation", fixed_recall=0.85)
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data, callbacks=[result_logger])
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of each callback class defined in this code?
- `NothingCallback` prints messages at the beginning and end of each epoch, as well as at the end of each batch.
- `ControlledStoppingCheckpointCallback` is a subclass of `ModelCheckpoint` that stops training after a specified epoch.
- `SyncingTensorBoard` is a subclass of `TensorBoard` that synchronizes logs with a remote directory using `gsutil`.

2. What is the purpose of the `AdditionalResultLogger` class?
The `AdditionalResultLogger` class is a Keras callback that computes and logs additional evaluation metrics for a given dataset (e.g. validation or test). It can handle binary or multiclass classification problems, and can log metrics such as precision, recall, AUC, and more.

3. What external libraries are being used in this code?
The code imports several external libraries, including `collections`, `os`, `sklearn`, `tensorflow`, and `wandb`. It also imports several modules from the project's own codebase, such as `default_settings_tox`, `default_settings_abs`, `parse_labeled_data`, and `compute_precision_fixed_recall`.
