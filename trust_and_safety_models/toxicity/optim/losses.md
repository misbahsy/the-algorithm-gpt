This code defines two custom loss functions, InvKLD and MaskedBCE, which can be used in a larger machine learning project. 

The InvKLD function calculates the inverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and true values. It takes in two parameters, y_true and y_pred, which are the true and predicted values, respectively. The function first converts y_pred to a tensor and y_true to the same data type as y_pred. It then clips both y_true and y_pred to ensure that they are within a certain range. Finally, it calculates the inverse Kullback-Leibler divergence using the reduce_sum and math.log functions from TensorFlow.

The MaskedBCE function calculates the binary cross-entropy between the predicted and true values, but only for the values where the true value is not equal to -1. This is useful in cases where some of the true values are missing or unknown. The function takes in the same two parameters as InvKLD, and first converts y_true to a float32 data type. It then creates a mask where the true values are not equal to -1, and applies this mask to both y_true and y_pred using the boolean_mask function from TensorFlow. Finally, it calculates the binary cross-entropy using the keras.metrics.binary_crossentropy function.

Both of these custom loss functions are defined using the LossFunctionWrapper class, which is a subclass of the tf.keras.losses.Loss class. This class allows for easy customization of loss functions, and includes methods for calling the loss function and getting its configuration. The InvKLD and MaskedBCE classes are subclasses of LossFunctionWrapper, and simply define the name and default reduction method for each loss function.

Overall, this code provides two useful custom loss functions that can be used in a larger machine learning project. These functions allow for more flexibility in the types of loss functions that can be used, and can help improve the accuracy of the model.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines two custom loss functions, `InvKLD` and `MaskedBCE`, using TensorFlow and Keras.

2. What is the difference between `InvKLD` and `MaskedBCE`?
- `InvKLD` calculates the inverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and true values, while `MaskedBCE` calculates the binary cross-entropy loss between the predicted and true values, with masking to ignore certain values.

3. What is the significance of the `LossFunctionWrapper` class?
- The `LossFunctionWrapper` class is a subclass of `tf.keras.losses.Loss` that allows for the creation of custom loss functions with additional arguments and configurations. Both `InvKLD` and `MaskedBCE` inherit from this class.
