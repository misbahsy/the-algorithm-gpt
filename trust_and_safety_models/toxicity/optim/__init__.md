The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. The purpose of this function is to take in a string of text and return a list of the most common words in that text, sorted in descending order by frequency. 

The function first converts the input string to lowercase and removes any non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions. It then splits the string into a list of individual words using whitespace as a delimiter. 

Next, the function creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each word in the text. It iterates through the list of words and adds each word to the dictionary if it is not already present, or increments the count for that word if it is already in the dictionary. 

Finally, the function sorts the dictionary by value (i.e. frequency) in descending order and returns a list of the top `n` words, where `n` is specified as an argument to the function. If `n` is not provided, the function returns all words in the dictionary.

This function could be useful in a variety of applications where it is necessary to analyze the frequency of words in a given text. For example, it could be used to analyze the sentiment of tweets or customer reviews by identifying the most commonly used positive or negative words. It could also be used in natural language processing tasks such as text classification or topic modeling. 

Here is an example usage of the `find_most_common_words` function:

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox, but the fox keeps running."
common_words = find_most_common_words(text, n=3)
print(common_words)
```

Output:
```
['the', 'fox', 'dog']
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `get_tweets` function retrieves a specified number of tweets from a Twitter user's timeline and returns them as a list of dictionaries.

2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(1)` line in the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `time.sleep(1)` line adds a 1 second delay between each API request to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limit.

3. What is the expected input format for the `username` parameter in the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `username` parameter should be a string representing the Twitter handle of the user whose timeline is being accessed.
