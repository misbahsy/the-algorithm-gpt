The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. The purpose of this function is to take in a string of text and return a list of the most common words in that text, sorted in descending order by frequency. 

The function first removes any punctuation from the input string using the `translate` method and a string of punctuation characters. It then converts the string to lowercase using the `lower` method. The resulting string is split into a list of words using the `split` method. 

The function then creates a dictionary called `word_count` to keep track of the frequency of each word in the input text. It iterates over the list of words and adds each word to the dictionary if it is not already present, with a value of 1. If the word is already in the dictionary, its value is incremented by 1. 

Finally, the function uses the `sorted` method to sort the dictionary by value in descending order, and returns a list of the keys (i.e. the words) in that sorted dictionary. 

This function could be used in a larger project that involves analyzing text data, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling. For example, it could be used to identify the most common words in a set of tweets or customer reviews, which could then be used to identify trends or topics of interest. 

Example usage:

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox, but the fox keeps running."
common_words = find_most_common_words(text)
print(common_words)
```

Output:
```
['the', 'fox', 'dog', 'over', 'quick', 'brown', 'jumps', 'lazy', 'but', 'keeps', 'running', 'at', 'barks']
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_tweet_sentiment` function?
   - The `get_tweet_sentiment` function is used to analyze the sentiment of a given tweet and return a string indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

2. What is the significance of the `stopwords` variable?
   - The `stopwords` variable contains a list of common words that are typically filtered out when analyzing text data. In this code, it is used to remove these words from the tweet before sentiment analysis is performed.

3. How is the `TextBlob` library used in this code?
   - The `TextBlob` library is used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweet text. The `TextBlob` object is created with the tweet text as input, and the `sentiment` property is used to retrieve the polarity and subjectivity scores for the text.
