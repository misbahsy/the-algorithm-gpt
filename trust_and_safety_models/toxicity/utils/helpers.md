This code file contains several utility functions that are used in The Algorithm from Twitter project. 

The `upload_model` function takes a full GCS model path as input and uploads the model to a local directory. If the path does not start with "gs://", it is added to the beginning of the path. The function creates a directory for the model in the local directory and copies the model files to that directory. If the model path contains an epoch number, the function copies the checkpoint and weights files to the local directory. Otherwise, it copies the entire directory to the local directory. The function returns the path to the weights directory.

The `compute_precision_fixed_recall` function takes two arrays of labels and predictions and a fixed recall value as input. It computes the precision at the given recall value using the precision-recall curve. The function returns the precision value and the threshold value at the given recall.

The `load_inference_func` function takes a model folder path as input and loads the saved model using TensorFlow's `saved_model.load` function. It returns the inference function for the loaded model.

The `execute_query` function takes a BigQuery client and a query string as input. It executes the query using the client and returns the result as a Pandas DataFrame.

The `execute_command` function takes a shell command string as input and executes it using Python's `subprocess.run` function. It prints the standard error and standard output of the command if the `print_` flag is set to True.

The `check_gpu` function checks if a GPU is available and accessible by running the `nvidia-smi` command and listing the physical devices using TensorFlow's `list_physical_devices` function. It raises an error if no GPU is found or if TensorFlow cannot find the GPU.

The `set_seeds` function sets the random seeds for NumPy, Python's built-in `random` module, and TensorFlow using their respective seed functions. This ensures reproducibility of the results across different runs of the code.

These utility functions are used in various parts of The Algorithm from Twitter project, such as training and evaluating machine learning models, loading and serving saved models, and executing BigQuery queries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code includes functions for uploading a model to Google Cloud Storage, computing precision at a fixed recall, loading an inference function, executing a query, checking for GPU availability, and setting random seeds.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `bisect`, `os`, `subprocess`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, and `tensorflow` modules. It also imports a `LOCAL_DIR` variable from a settings file.

3. What is the expected input and output of each function?
- `upload_model` takes a full GCS model path as input and returns a weights directory path as output.
- `compute_precision_fixed_recall` takes true labels and predicted probabilities as input and returns precision and threshold values as output.
- `load_inference_func` takes a model folder path as input and returns an inference function as output.
- `execute_query` takes a BigQuery client and query string as input and returns a Pandas DataFrame as output.
- `execute_command` takes a shell command string as input and prints the stderr and stdout outputs. It does not return anything.
- `check_gpu` does not take any input and does not return anything. It raises an error if there is no GPU or if TensorFlow has not found the GPU.
- `set_seeds` takes a seed value as input and does not return anything. It sets the random seeds for NumPy, Python, and TensorFlow.
