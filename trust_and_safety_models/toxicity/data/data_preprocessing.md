This code defines three classes related to cleaning and preprocessing data for a machine learning pipeline that deals with toxicity classification of tweets. The `DataframeCleaner` class is an abstract base class that defines three methods: `_clean`, `_systematic_preprocessing`, and `_postprocess`. The `_clean` method is meant to be overridden by subclasses to perform any data cleaning specific to the dataset. The `_systematic_preprocessing` method performs a series of systematic preprocessing steps, such as removing tweets with media, deleting duplicates, and resetting the index. The `_postprocess` method is meant to be overridden by subclasses to perform any postprocessing steps specific to the dataset. The `__call__` method is defined to call the three methods in order and return the cleaned and preprocessed dataframe.

The `DefaultENNoPreprocessor` class is a subclass of `DataframeCleaner` that overrides the `_postprocess` method to perform additional steps specific to English tweets. It calculates the `vote` and `agreement_rate` columns based on the `toxic_count` and `non_toxic_count` columns, and it replaces the label column with a different column if specified in the `kwargs` argument. It also filters out tweets with low agreement rates if specified in the `kwargs` argument.

The `DefaultENPreprocessor` class is a subclass of `DefaultENNoPreprocessor` that overrides the `_clean` method to perform additional cleaning steps specific to English tweets. It replaces URLs and mentions with placeholders and removes newlines and HTML entities.

The `Defaulti18nPreprocessor` class is a subclass of `DataframeCleaner` that overrides the `_clean` method to perform cleaning steps specific to non-English tweets. It removes URLs, mentions, and newlines.

Overall, these classes provide a framework for cleaning and preprocessing tweet data for a toxicity classification pipeline. The `DataframeCleaner` class can be subclassed to perform any dataset-specific cleaning and preprocessing steps, and the `DefaultENNoPreprocessor`, `DefaultENPreprocessor`, and `Defaulti18nPreprocessor` classes provide examples of how to perform cleaning and preprocessing steps specific to English and non-English tweets.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DataframeCleaner` class and its methods?
- The `DataframeCleaner` class is a parent class for data cleaning and preprocessing. Its methods `_clean`, `_systematic_preprocessing`, and `_postprocess` are used to clean and preprocess the input dataframe before returning it.

2. What is the purpose of the `DefaultENNoPreprocessor` and `DefaultENPreprocessor` classes?
- The `DefaultENNoPreprocessor` and `DefaultENPreprocessor` classes are subclasses of `DataframeCleaner` that are used for English language data preprocessing. They implement additional preprocessing steps such as removing URLs and mentions, and replacing them with placeholders.

3. What is the purpose of the `mapping_func` function?
- The `mapping_func` function is used to map the label of each element in the input dataframe to a new label. If the `aggregated_content` of an element is in the `TOXIC_35_set`, it is labeled as 1. If the `label` of an element is 1, it is labeled as 1. Otherwise, it is labeled as 0.
