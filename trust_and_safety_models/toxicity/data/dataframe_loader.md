The code defines two classes, `DataframeLoader` and its subclass `ENLoaderWithSampling`, and one abstract method `abstractmethod`. The purpose of these classes is to load and preprocess data for a machine learning pipeline that detects toxic language on Twitter. 

`DataframeLoader` is an abstract class that defines two abstract methods, `produce_query` and `load_data`. `ENLoaderWithSampling` is a subclass of `DataframeLoader` that implements these two methods. 

`ENLoaderWithSampling` loads data from a BigQuery database and preprocesses it for use in a machine learning pipeline. The `load_data` method loads data from the database and preprocesses it by sampling from different subsets of the data based on certain criteria. The `sample` method samples from the data based on the specified criteria, such as keyword matching or random sampling. The `sample_keywords` method samples from the data based on specific keywords, such as politics, insults, or race. The `sample_with_weights` method samples from the data based on the distribution of labels in the data. 

Overall, the purpose of this code is to load and preprocess data for a machine learning pipeline that detects toxic language on Twitter. The `ENLoaderWithSampling` class is a key component of this pipeline, as it loads and preprocesses the data for use in the pipeline. The sampling methods implemented in this class are designed to improve the performance of the machine learning model by ensuring that the data used to train the model is representative of the data that the model will encounter in the real world.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DataframeLoader` abstract class and its two abstract methods `produce_query` and `load_data`?
- The `DataframeLoader` abstract class serves as a blueprint for classes that will load data into a Pandas dataframe. The `produce_query` method is responsible for generating a SQL query based on the loader's settings, while the `load_data` method executes the query and returns the resulting dataframe.
2. What is the purpose of the `ENLoaderWithSampling` class and its `sample` method?
- The `ENLoaderWithSampling` class is a subclass of `ENLoader` that adds the ability to sample data from the loaded dataframe. The `sample` method takes in a dataframe and various sampling parameters, and returns a new dataframe that has been sampled according to those parameters.
3. What is the purpose of the `I18nLoader` class and its `load_data` method?
- The `I18nLoader` class is responsible for loading data for non-English languages. Its `load_data` method takes in a language code and other parameters, generates a SQL query based on those parameters, executes the query, and returns the resulting dataframe.
