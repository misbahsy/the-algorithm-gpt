The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. This function takes in two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `n`. The purpose of this function is to find the `n` most common words in the given `text` string and return them as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the word and its frequency in the text.

To achieve this, the function first converts the entire `text` string to lowercase using the `lower()` method. It then uses the `re` module to split the string into individual words using a regular expression pattern that matches any non-alphanumeric character as a delimiter. The resulting list of words is then filtered to remove any empty strings using a list comprehension.

Next, the function creates a dictionary called `word_counts` to store the frequency of each word in the text. It iterates over the list of words and increments the count for each word in the dictionary. Finally, the function uses the `sorted()` function to sort the dictionary by value in descending order and returns the first `n` items as a list of tuples.

This function can be used in a larger project that involves analyzing text data, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling. For example, it could be used to identify the most common words in a set of tweets related to a particular topic, which could then be used to generate a word cloud or to inform the selection of keywords for further analysis.

Example usage:

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox."
most_common_words = find_most_common_words(text, 3)
print(most_common_words)
# Output: [('the', 3), ('fox', 2), ('dog', 2)]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `get_tweets` function retrieves a specified number of tweets from a Twitter user's timeline and returns them as a list of dictionaries.

2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(1)` line in the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `time.sleep(1)` line adds a 1-second delay between each API request to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limit.

3. What is the expected input format for the `username` parameter in the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `username` parameter should be a string representing the Twitter handle of the user whose timeline is being accessed.
