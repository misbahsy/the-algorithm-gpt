The code provided is a Python implementation of the QuickSort algorithm. QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, one containing elements smaller than a chosen pivot element, and the other containing elements larger than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the two sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

The `quick_sort` function takes an array as input and returns the sorted array. It first checks if the length of the array is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns the array as is. Otherwise, it chooses a pivot element (in this case, the last element of the array) and partitions the array into two sub-arrays using the `partition` function. It then recursively calls `quick_sort` on the two sub-arrays and concatenates the sorted sub-arrays with the pivot element in between.

The `partition` function takes an array and a pivot index as input and returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning the array. It first sets the pivot element to be the last element of the array and initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the array, swapping elements as necessary so that all elements smaller than the pivot are to the left of `i` and all elements larger than the pivot are to the right of `j`. Finally, it swaps the pivot element with the element at index `i` and returns `i`.

This implementation of QuickSort can be used in a larger project whenever sorting of arrays is required. For example, it can be used to sort a list of tweets by their timestamp or to sort a list of users by their follower count. Here is an example usage of the `quick_sort` function:

```
unsorted_array = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sorted_array = quick_sort(unsorted_array)
print(sorted_array) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_followers` function?
   - The `get_followers` function retrieves a list of followers for a given Twitter user.

2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(60)` line?
   - The `time.sleep(60)` line pauses the program for 60 seconds before continuing, likely to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limit for API requests.

3. How is the `followers` list being used in the program?
   - The `followers` list is being used to store the followers of a given Twitter user and is later used to perform various operations such as filtering and sorting.
