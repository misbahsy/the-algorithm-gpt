The `PermutedInputFnFactory` class is used to generate an input function that passes in a preset number of records that have been feature permuted. The class takes in a `data_dir` parameter, which is the location of the records on HDFS, and a `record_count` parameter, which is the number of records to process. If a `file_list` parameter is provided, it is used instead of `data_dir`. The class also takes in a `datarecord_filter_fn` parameter, which is a function that takes a single data sample in `com.twitter.ml.api.ttypes.DataRecord` format and returns a boolean value to indicate if this data record should be kept in the feature importance module or not.

The `PermutedInputFnFactory` class has a method called `get_permuted_input_fn`, which returns an input function that passes in a preset number of records that have been feature permuted. The method takes in a `batch_size` parameter, a `parse_fn` parameter, and a `fname_ftypes` parameter. The `parse_fn` parameter is the function used to parse inputs, and the `fname_ftypes` parameter is a list of tuples containing the names and types of the features to permute.

The `PermutedInputFnFactory` class also has a method called `_permutate_features`, which is used to replace a feature value with a value from a randomly selected record. The method takes in a `rec` parameter, which is a `datarecord` returned from `DataRecordGenerator`, a `fname_ftypes` parameter, which is a list of tuples containing the names and types of the features to permute, and a `records` parameter, which is the records to sample from.

The `PermutedInputFnFactory` class uses the `bytes_to_thrift_object` and `thrift_object_to_bytes` functions from the `twitter.deepbird.util.thrift.simple_converters` module to convert bytes to `DataRecord` objects and vice versa.

The `PermutedInputFnFactory` class is used in the larger project to generate input functions for feature importance modules. The feature importance modules use these input functions to train models on permuted data to determine the importance of each feature. The `_permutate_features` method is used to permute the features in the data records, which allows the feature importance modules to determine the importance of each feature by comparing the performance of models trained on permuted data to models trained on unpermuted data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the PermutedInputFnFactory class?
- The PermutedInputFnFactory class is used to generate an input function that passes in a preset number of records that have been feature permuted.

2. What is the significance of the datarecord_filter_fn parameter in the PermutedInputFnFactory constructor?
- The datarecord_filter_fn parameter is a function that takes a single data sample in com.twitter.ml.api.ttypes.DataRecord format and returns a boolean value, indicating if this data record should be kept in the feature importance module or not.

3. What is the purpose of the _permutate_features function?
- The _permutate_features function is used to replace a feature value with a value from a randomly selected record. It takes in a datarecord, a list of feature names and types to permute, and a list of records to sample from, and returns the record with the feature permuted.
