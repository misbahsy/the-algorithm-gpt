The code provides a general optimizer for pruning features of a neural network. The optimizer estimates the computational cost of features, combines this information with pruning signals indicating their usefulness, and disables features via binary masks at regular intervals. 

To make a layer prunable, the user can use `twml.contrib.pruning.apply_mask`. For example, `dense1 = tf.layers.dense(inputs=inputs, units=50, activation=tf.nn.relu)` can be made prunable by adding `dense1 = apply_mask(dense1)`.

To prune the network, the user can apply PruningOptimizer to any cross-entropy loss. For example, `loss = tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(labels=labels, logits=logits)` can be pruned using `optimizer = PruningOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001, momentum=0.5)`. The `minimize` method of the optimizer is then called with the appropriate parameters, such as `prune_every`, `burn_in`, `flops_weight`, and `flops_target`.

The `PruningOptimizer` class extends `tf.train.MomentumOptimizer` and updates parameters with SGD and pruning masks using Fisher pruning. The class takes in arguments such as `learning_rate`, `momentum`, `use_locking`, `name`, and `use_nesterov`. The `minimize` method creates operations to minimize loss and to prune features. 

The method calculates a pruning signal that measures the importance of feature maps. This is weighed against the computational cost of computing a feature map. Features are then iteratively pruned based on a weighted average of feature importance S and computational cost C (in FLOPs). The method supports only the 'Fisher' method for computing the pruning signal. 

The method also estimates the computational cost per data point and per feature map. The targeted trade-off between computational complexity and performance can be controlled using `flops_weight`. The method prunes every few update steps after a burn-in phase and stops pruning when computational complexity is less than or equal to a specified number of floating-point operations (`flops_target`). 

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for optimizing neural networks by pruning features and reducing computational complexity.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides an optimizer for pruning features of a neural network. It estimates the computational cost of features, combines this information with pruning signals indicating their usefulness, and disables features via binary masks at regular intervals.

2. How do you make a layer prunable?
- To make a layer prunable, use `twml.contrib.pruning.apply_mask` after defining the layer.

3. What are the arguments for the `minimize` function?
- The `minimize` function takes in the loss to minimize, `prune_every` (an int indicating how often to prune), `burn_in` (an int indicating how many parameter updates to wait before starting pruning), `decay` (a float controlling the exponential moving average of pruning signals), `flops_weight` (a float or str controlling the targeted trade-off between computational complexity and performance), `flops_target` (a float indicating when to stop pruning), `update_params` (an optional training operation used instead of MomentumOptimizer to update parameters), and `method` (a str indicating the method used to compute pruning signal, currently only supports 'Fisher').
