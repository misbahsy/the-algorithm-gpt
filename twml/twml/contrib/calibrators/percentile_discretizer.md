This code defines two classes, `PercentileDiscretizerFeature` and `PercentileDiscretizerCalibrator`, which are used for calibrating a Percentile Discretizer in a larger project. The Percentile Discretizer is a technique used to transform continuous features into discrete features by dividing the range of feature values into bins based on percentiles.

`PercentileDiscretizerFeature` accumulates and calibrates a single sparse Percentile Discretizer feature. It has a method `calibrate()` that takes in bin values, percentiles, and percentile indices, and calibrates the feature into bin values for use in `PercentileDiscretizerCalibrator`.

`PercentileDiscretizerCalibrator` accumulates features and their respective values for Percentile Discretizer calibration. It has methods for accumulating features from batches (`accumulate_features()`), accumulating features from trainer API (`accumulate_feature()`), and accumulating a single batch of feature keys, values, and weights (`accumulate()`). After accumulating features, the `calibrate()` method is called to calibrate each Percentile Discretizer feature. Finally, the `to_layer()` method returns a `twml.layers.PercentileDiscretizer` layer that can be used for feature discretization in the larger project.

Here's an example of how these classes might be used in the larger project:

1. Accumulate feature values from batches by calling `accumulate()`.
2. Calibrate all features into Percentile Discretizer bin values by calling `calibrate()`.
3. Convert to a `twml.layers.PercentileDiscretizer` layer by calling `to_layer()`.

Additionally, the code provides methods for saving the calibrator, writing summary information, and adding TensorFlow Hub signatures for the calibrator.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PercentileDiscretizerFeature` class and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `PercentileDiscretizerFeature` class is used to accumulate and calibrate a single sparse PercentileDiscretizer feature. It stores the feature values and their corresponding weights, and provides a `calibrate()` method to determine the bin boundaries for the feature based on the accumulated values and weights.

2. **Question**: How does the `PercentileDiscretizerCalibrator` class accumulate and calibrate features?
   **Answer**: The `PercentileDiscretizerCalibrator` class accumulates features and their respective values using the `accumulate()` method, which stores the feature values and weights in a `PercentileDiscretizerFeature` object. After accumulation, the `calibrate()` method is called to calibrate all features into PercentileDiscretizer bin values.

3. **Question**: How can the calibrated features be used in a TensorFlow model?
   **Answer**: After calibration, the `to_layer()` method can be called to convert the `PercentileDiscretizerCalibrator` into a `twml.layers.PercentileDiscretizer` layer, which can then be used for feature discretization in a TensorFlow model.
