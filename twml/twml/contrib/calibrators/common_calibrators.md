This module provides functions for calibrating and exporting machine learning models, specifically focusing on Isotonic Calibration and Discretization. It is designed to be used in a larger project that involves training and evaluating models using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.

The `calibrator_arguments` function adds command-line arguments related to the calibrator to an argument parser. Similarly, the `discretizer_arguments` function adds command-line arguments related to the discretizer.

The `get_calibrate_input_fn` and `get_discretize_input_fn` functions return input functions for calibration and discretization, respectively. These input functions are used to generate data for the calibration and discretization processes.

The `calibrate` function trains an Isotonic Calibrator on the provided data and saves the calibrated model. The `discretize` function trains a discretizer on the provided data and saves the discretized model.

The `add_discretizer_arguments` and `add_isotonic_calibrator_arguments` functions add discretizer-specific and isotonic calibrator-specific command-line arguments to a Trainer parser, respectively.

The `calibrate_calibrator_and_export` function trains a calibrator, evaluates it, and exports it as a TensorFlow Hub module. The `calibrate_discretizer_and_export` function trains a discretizer and exports it as a TensorFlow Hub module.

The `build_percentile_discretizer_graph` function builds a graph for the Percentile Discretizer. The `isotonic_module` function creates a common Isotonic Calibrator module for Hub Export. The `build_isotonic_graph_from_inputs` and `build_isotonic_graph` functions build graphs for the Isotonic Calibrator using the provided inputs and features.

These functions can be used in a larger project to train, calibrate, and export machine learning models, making it easier to integrate these models into other applications.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `_generate_files_by_datetime` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `_generate_files_by_datetime` function is used to generate a list of files based on their datetime. It takes the `params` object as input and uses the `list_files_by_datetime` function from the `twml.util` module to generate the list of files. It filters the files based on the start and end datetime provided in the `params` object.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `calibrate` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `calibrate` function is used to calibrate an Isotonic Calibrator. It takes a trainer, params, build_graph, input_fn, and an optional debug flag as input. If the trainer is the chief, it trains the calibrator using the input_fn and build_graph function, then saves the calibrator to the specified save directory. If the trainer is not the chief, it waits for the calibrator to be ready in the save directory.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `discretize` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `discretize` function is used to discretize continuous features. It takes params, feature_config, input_fn, and an optional debug flag as input. If the current task is chief or there are no workers, it trains the discretizer using the input_fn and feature_config, then exports the discretizer as a TensorFlow Hub module. If the current task is a worker, it waits for the discretizer to be ready in the save directory.
