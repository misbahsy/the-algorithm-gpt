The code defines two functions, `diag_mask` and `full_mask`, which are used in pairwise learning-to-rank. 

The `diag_mask` function takes in two arguments: `n_data`, an integer tensor, and `pairwise_label_scores`, a dense tensor of shape `[n_data, n_data]`. The function returns a mask tensor and a pair count tensor. The mask tensor is created by subtracting a diagonal tensor of ones from a tensor of ones, and then casting the resulting tensor to float32. The pair count tensor is calculated by multiplying `n_data` by `n_data-1`, casting the result to float32, and returning it. The purpose of this function is to return the values in `pairwise_label_scores` except for the diagonal, where each cell contains a pairwise score difference, and only selfs/diags are 0s.

The `full_mask` function also takes in two arguments: `n_data`, an integer tensor, and `pairwise_label_scores`, a dense tensor of shape `[n_data, n_data]`. The function returns a mask tensor and a pair count tensor. The mask tensor is created by subtracting a tensor of ones from a tensor of ones where the pairs have the same labels, and then casting the resulting tensor to float32. The pair count tensor is calculated by reducing the sum of the mask tensor and casting the result to float32. The purpose of this function is to return the values in `pairwise_label_scores` except for pairs that have the same labels, where each cell contains a pairwise score difference, and all `pairwise_label_scores` are 0.5: selfs and same labels are 0s.

These functions are used in pairwise learning-to-rank, which is a technique used in information retrieval to rank a set of items based on user preferences. The purpose of these functions is to create a mask tensor that can be used to calculate the pairwise score differences between items in the set. The resulting tensor can then be used to rank the items based on their pairwise score differences. 

Example usage:

```
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
from file_location import diag_mask, full_mask

n_data = tf.constant(5)
pairwise_label_scores = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3],
                                     [0.5, 1.0, 0.7, 0.4, 0.1],
                                     [0.2, 0.7, 1.0, 0.6, 0.9],
                                     [0.8, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 0.2],
                                     [0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 1.0]])

mask, pair_count = diag_mask(n_data, pairwise_label_scores)
print(mask)
# Output: [[0. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
#          [1. 0. 1. 1. 1.]
#          [1. 1. 0. 1. 1.]
#          [1. 1. 1. 0. 1.]
#          [1. 1. 1. 1. 0.]]

print(pair_count)
# Output: 20.0

mask, pair_count = full_mask(n_data, pairwise_label_scores)
print(mask)
# Output: [[0. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
#          [1. 0. 1. 1. 1.]
#          [1. 1. 0. 1. 0.]
#          [1. 1. 1. 0. 1.]
#          [1. 1. 0. 1. 0.]]

print(pair_count)
# Output: 16.0

## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem is it trying to solve?
- This code is related to pairwise learning-to-rank and provides two functions for creating masks to be used in calculating pairwise score differences.
2. What is the input format for the `pairwise_label_scores` argument?
- The `pairwise_label_scores` argument is expected to be a dense `Tensor` of shape [n_data, n_data].
3. What is the output format of the `full_mask` function and how is it calculated?
- The `full_mask` function returns a mask `Tensor` and a pair count `Tensor`. The mask `Tensor` contains values in `pairwise_label_scores` except pairs that have the same labels, and each cell contains a pairwise score difference. The mask is calculated by subtracting a `Tensor` of the same shape as `pairwise_label_scores` that is `True` where `pairwise_label_scores` is equal to 0.5, and `False` otherwise, from a `Tensor` of ones. The pair count is calculated by summing the mask `Tensor`.
