The code provided contains a set of functions that allow querying the devices being used by TensorFlow. The purpose of these functions is to provide information about the available GPUs and their count, as well as to check if GPUs are available for use.

The `get_device_map()` function returns a dictionary that maps the name of each device to its type. This is achieved by calling the `list_local_devices()` method from the `device_lib` module of TensorFlow. The returned dictionary can be used to identify the available devices and their types.

The `get_gpu_list()` function uses the `get_device_map()` function to obtain the list of available GPUs. It returns a list of the names of the GPUs that are available for use. This function can be used to identify the specific GPUs that can be used for training a model.

The `get_gpu_count()` function returns the count of available GPUs. It uses the `get_gpu_list()` function to obtain the list of available GPUs and returns the length of that list. This function can be used to determine the number of GPUs that can be used for parallel training.

The `is_gpu_available()` function returns a boolean value indicating whether GPUs are available for use. It uses the `get_gpu_count()` function to obtain the count of available GPUs and returns `True` if the count is greater than zero, indicating that at least one GPU is available for use.

Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to query the available devices and their types, as well as to check if GPUs are available for use. They can be used in the larger project to optimize the training of TensorFlow models by identifying the available GPUs and using them for parallel training. For example, the `get_gpu_list()` function can be used to specify which GPUs to use for training a model, while the `is_gpu_available()` function can be used to check if GPUs are available before attempting to train a model.
