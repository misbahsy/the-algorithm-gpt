The code above defines a function called `cosine_similarity` that calculates the cosine similarity between two tensors using TensorFlow. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. It is commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing applications to compare the similarity of two vectors.

The function takes three arguments: `x1`, `x2`, and `axis`. `x1` and `x2` are TensorFlow tensors that represent the vectors to be compared, and `axis` is the dimension along which to normalize the vectors. The function first normalizes the two input tensors using the L2 normalization method, which scales the vectors to have a unit length. Then, it calculates the dot product of the two normalized vectors and returns the result.

This function can be used in a variety of machine learning applications, such as image recognition, text classification, and recommendation systems. For example, in a recommendation system, the cosine similarity can be used to compare the similarity between two users based on their past purchases or ratings. The higher the cosine similarity between two users, the more similar their preferences are, and the more likely they are to enjoy the same products or services.

Here is an example of how to use the `cosine_similarity` function:

```
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf

# Define two tensors
x1 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
x2 = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])

# Calculate the cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(x1, x2, axis=0)

# Print the result
print(similarity)
```

In this example, the function calculates the cosine similarity between the two tensors `x1` and `x2` along the first dimension (axis=0). The output should be a scalar value representing the similarity between the two vectors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a function for calculating the cosine similarity of two tensors using TensorFlow.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `cosine_similarity` function?
- The inputs are two TensorFlow tensors (`x1` and `x2`) and an integer representing the axis along which to normalize. The output is a TensorFlow tensor representing the cosine similarity between `x1` and `x2`.

3. What version of TensorFlow is being used in this code?
- The code is using TensorFlow version 1, as indicated by the import statement at the beginning of the code (`import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf`).
