The code defines two functions that are used to organize and split dataset files for training and evaluation in a time-based manner. 

The first function, `resolve_train_and_eval_files_overlap`, takes in two lists of file names, `train_files` and `eval_files`, and a fraction `fraction_kept_for_eval` that determines the proportion of overlapping files that should be assigned to the evaluation set. If there are any files that appear in both `train_files` and `eval_files`, a random subset of them is selected to be moved exclusively to `eval_files`. The function returns two lists, `new_train_files` and `new_eval_files`, with the overlapping files resolved. 

The second function, `get_time_based_dataset_files_for_train_and_eval`, is a convenience function that uses `get_time_based_dataset_files` from the `twml` package to get the dataset files for training and evaluation based on their time-based prefixes. It then calls `resolve_train_and_eval_files_overlap` to resolve any overlap between the two sets of files. 

Overall, these functions are useful for organizing and splitting dataset files for machine learning tasks that require training and evaluation sets. The time-based organization allows for better control over the temporal aspect of the data, while the overlap resolution ensures that the evaluation set is not contaminated with data that has already been seen during training. 

Example usage:

```
train_start_datetime = '2022/01/01/00'
train_end_datetime = '2022/01/02/00'
eval_start_datetime = '2022/01/02/00'
eval_end_datetime = '2022/01/03/00'
fraction_kept_for_eval = 0.2
base_path = '/path/to/dataset/files'

train_files, eval_files = get_time_based_dataset_files_for_train_and_eval(
  base_path=base_path,
  train_start_datetime=train_start_datetime,
  train_end_datetime=train_end_datetime,
  eval_start_datetime=eval_start_datetime,
  eval_end_datetime=eval_end_datetime,
  fraction_kept_for_eval=fraction_kept_for_eval
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `twml` module and where can it be found?
- A smart developer might wonder what the `twml` module is and where it can be found. The `twml` module is imported at the beginning of the code and is used to call the `list_files_by_datetime` function. It is not clear from this code where the `twml` module can be found.

2. What is the purpose of the `resolve_train_and_eval_files_overlap` function and how is it used?
- A smart developer might want to know what the `resolve_train_and_eval_files_overlap` function does and how it is used. The function is used to resolve any overlap between the `train_files` and `eval_files` lists by randomly assigning a fraction of the overlap to the `eval_files` list. The function takes in four arguments: `train_files`, `eval_files`, `fraction_kept_for_eval`, and `seed`. An example usage of the function is provided in the docstring.

3. What is the purpose of the `get_time_based_dataset_files_for_train_and_eval` function and how is it used?
- A smart developer might want to know what the `get_time_based_dataset_files_for_train_and_eval` function does and how it is used. The function is a convenience function that calls the `get_time_based_dataset_files` function and the `resolve_train_and_eval_files_overlap` function. It takes in several arguments including `base_path`, `train_start_datetime`, `train_end_datetime`, `eval_start_datetime`, `eval_end_datetime`, `fraction_kept_for_eval`, `datetime_prefix_format`, `extension`, and `parallelism`. The function returns a tuple of two lists: `train_files` and `eval_files`.
