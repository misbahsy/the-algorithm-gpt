This module contains a collection of experimental utility functions for the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this module is to provide a set of functions that can be used to perform various mathematical operations, normalization, and similarity calculations. 

The module imports several functions from other modules within the project, such as `math_fns`, `masks`, `normalizer`, `scores`, `loss_fns`, `device`, `similarities`, and `interp`. These functions are used to perform various tasks such as calculating NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), creating masks for matrices, normalizing data, calculating pairwise and listwise losses, and checking for available GPUs. 

For example, the `safe_div` function from `math_fns` is used to perform a safe division operation that returns 0 if the denominator is 0. The `cosine_similarity` function from `similarities` is used to calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors. The `get_pairwise_scores` function from `scores` is used to calculate pairwise scores between two sets of data. 

Overall, this module provides a set of utility functions that can be used throughout the larger project to perform various mathematical and normalization operations. These functions can be imported and used in other modules within the project as needed. 

Example usage:

```
from contrib.utils import safe_div, cosine_similarity

a = 5
b = 0

result = safe_div(a, b)
print(result) # Output: 0

vec1 = [1, 2, 3]
vec2 = [4, 5, 6]

similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)
print(similarity) # Output: 0.9746318461970762
```
