The code provided is a set of functions that calculate ranking metrics for machine learning models. Specifically, it calculates Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Swapped NDCG scores. These metrics are commonly used in information retrieval and recommendation systems to evaluate the quality of the ranking of items returned by a model. 

The `cal_ndcg` function calculates the NDCG score for a given set of label scores and predicted scores. The NDCG score is a measure of the quality of the ranking of items returned by a model. It is calculated by dividing the Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) by the Ideal DCG (IDCG). The DCG is calculated by summing the relevance scores of the top-k items returned by the model, where the relevance scores are weighted by a discount factor that decreases as the rank of the item increases. The IDCG is the DCG score that would be obtained if the items were ranked perfectly. The `cal_ndcg` function uses the `_get_ranking_orders`, `_get_relevance_scores`, `_get_cg_discount`, and `_dcg_idcg` functions to calculate the DCG and IDCG scores, and then uses the `safe_div` function to safely divide the DCG by the IDCG. 

The `cal_swapped_ndcg` function calculates the Swapped NDCG score for a given set of label scores and predicted scores. The Swapped NDCG score is a measure of the quality of the ranking of items returned by a model that takes into account the swapping of items in the ranking. It is calculated by swapping two items in the ranking and then recalculating the NDCG score. The difference between the original NDCG score and the swapped NDCG score is the Swapped NDCG score. The `cal_swapped_ndcg` function uses the `_get_ranking_orders`, `_get_relevance_scores`, `_get_cg_discount`, `_dcg_idcg`, and `safe_div` functions to calculate the original NDCG score and the swapped NDCG score, and then calculates the difference between the two scores. 

The `_get_ranking_orders` function sorts the label scores and predicted scores and returns the sorted label scores and the predicted scores in the order of the sorted predicted scores. The `_get_relevance_scores` function calculates the relevance scores of the items based on their scores. The `_get_cg_discount` function calculates the discount factor for the DCG score. The `_dcg_idcg` function calculates the DCG or IDCG score based on the relevance scores and the discount factor. The `safe_div` function safely divides two tensors element-wise, returning 0 if the denominator is <= 0. The `safe_log` function calculates the log of a tensor, handling cases where the raw scores are close to 0s.

Overall, these functions are useful for evaluating the quality of the ranking of items returned by a machine learning model. They can be used in the larger project to compare the performance of different models and to tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their ranking performance. 

Example usage:

```
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
from ndcg import cal_ndcg, cal_swapped_ndcg

# generate some random label scores and predicted scores
label_scores = tf.random.normal([10])
predicted_scores = tf.random.normal([10])

# calculate the NDCG score for the top 5 items
ndcg_score = cal_ndcg(label_scores, predicted_scores, top_k_int=5)

# calculate the Swapped NDCG score for the top 5 items
swapped_ndcg_score = cal_swapped_ndcg(label_scores, predicted_scores, top_k_int=5)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code calculates NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) and swapped NDCG scores for ranking positions based on predicted and label scores.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `cal_swapped_ndcg` function?
- The inputs are `label_scores` and `predicted_scores`, both real tensors with matching dtype, and `top_k_int`, an integer or integer tensor. The output is a tensor that holds the swapped NDCG score.

3. What is the purpose of the `safe_log` function?
- The purpose of the `safe_log` function is to calculate the log of a tensor while handling cases where the raw scores are close to 0s. It returns a float tensor that holds the safe log base e of the input.
