The `EventBusPipedBinaryRecordReader` class in this module provides a binary data record reader for EventBus data. It starts an EventBus subscriber in a separate process to receive EventBus streaming data. The subscriber is supposed to output received data through PIPE to this module. This module parses input and output binary data records to serve as a record reader.

The `EventBusPipedBinaryRecordReader` class inherits from the `BinaryRecordReader` class, which has three methods: `initialize()`, `read()`, and `close()`. The `initialize()` method initializes the `EventBusPipedBinaryRecordReader` object by starting a subprocess that runs a Java program that subscribes to an EventBus and outputs received data through PIPE to this module. The `read()` method reads raw bytes for one record from the PIPE output of the Java program. The `_find_next_record()` method is a helper method that finds the next record in the PIPE output by searching for a record separator. The `_read()` method is another helper method that reads the next record from the PIPE output by calling `_find_next_record()` and returning the bytes of the record. The `close()` method closes the PIPE output, buffered reader, and subprocess.

The `EventBusPipedBinaryRecordReader` class has several instance variables, including `JAVA`, which is the path to the Java executable; `RECORD_SEPARATOR_HEX`, which is a list of hexadecimal values that represent the record separator; `RECORD_SEPARATOR`, which is the record separator as a string; `RECORD_SEPARATOR_LENGTH`, which is the length of the record separator; `CHUNK_SIZE`, which is the size of the chunk of data to read from the PIPE output at a time; `jar_file`, which is the path to the Java program that subscribes to an EventBus; `num_eb_threads`, which is the number of EventBus threads to use; `subscriber_id`, which is the ID of the subscriber; `filter_str`, which is a filter string for the data; `buffer_size`, which is the size of the buffer for the buffered reader; `lock`, which is a lock for thread safety; `_pipe`, which is the PIPE output of the subprocess; `_buffered_reader`, which is a buffered reader for the PIPE output; and `_bytes_buffer`, which is a buffer for the bytes of the record.

This module can be used in the larger project to read binary data records from an EventBus. For example, the `EventBusPipedBinaryRecordReader` class can be used to read binary data records from an EventBus and process them in real-time. Here is an example of how to use this module:

```
reader = EventBusPipedBinaryRecordReader(jar_file='eventbus.jar', num_eb_threads=4, subscriber_id='my_subscriber')
reader.initialize()

while True:
    record = reader.read()
    # process record

    if done_processing:
        reader.close()
        break
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a binary data record reader for EventBus data by starting an EventBus subscriber in a separate process to receive EventBus streaming data and parsing input and output binary data record to serve as a record reader.

2. What is the significance of the `RECORD_SEPARATOR_HEX` variable?
- The `RECORD_SEPARATOR_HEX` variable is a list of hexadecimal values that represent the record separator used to separate binary data records.

3. What is the purpose of the `lock` variable?
- The `lock` variable is used to ensure thread safety when finding the next record in the `_find_next_record` method.
