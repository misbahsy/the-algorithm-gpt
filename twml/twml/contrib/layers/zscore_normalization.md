The code defines a layer for z-score normalization using moving mean and standard deviation. Z-score normalization is a common technique used to standardize data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This layer is designed to be used right after the input layer and is intended to handle missing values. 

The `ZscoreNormalization` class inherits from the `Layer` class and overrides the `call` method to perform the normalization. The `call` method takes in the input data, a boolean flag indicating whether the model is in training or inference mode, a dense mask indicating which values are missing, and several other optional parameters. If the model is in training mode, the `_training_pass` method is called to compute the normalization using the input data and the dense mask. If the model is in inference mode, the `_infer_pass` method is called instead. 

The `_training_pass` method computes the moving mean and standard deviation using the input data and updates them using the `update_moving_variable` function. The function takes in the batch variable, the moving variable, the decay rate, a boolean flag indicating whether to use zero debias, and a name for the operation. The function returns an identity operation that assigns the updated moving variable to the original moving variable. The `_training_pass` method then computes the normalized input using the moving mean and standard deviation and returns it. 

The `_infer_pass` method computes the normalized input using the moving mean and standard deviation without updating them. 

The `zscore_normalization` function is a wrapper function that creates an instance of the `ZscoreNormalization` class and calls its `call` method with the input data and other parameters. 

Overall, this layer is useful for standardizing input data and handling missing values in a deep learning model. It can be used in conjunction with other layers and models in the larger project to improve model performance and accuracy.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a layer for z-score normalization using moving mean and standard deviation. It includes methods for training and inference passes, as well as a function for applying the normalization to input data.

2. What is the purpose of the `_add_model_variable` function?
- The `_add_model_variable` function adds a variable to the `GraphKeys.MODEL_VARIABLES` collection. This is necessary for saving and restoring model variables.

3. What is the purpose of the `handle_single` argument in the `call` method and `zscore_normalization` function?
- The `handle_single` argument is used to handle the case where the standard deviation is 0 for a feature and the feature is not a missing value. In this case, if `handle_single` is True, the value is set to 1 instead of 0. This is useful when dealing with one-hot features that may have the same value for all instances.
