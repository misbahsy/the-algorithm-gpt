The code defines a StackedRNN layer that can be used to stack multiple RNN modules. The layer provides a unified interface for RNN modules that perform well on CPUs and GPUs. The StackedRNN layer takes in a tensor of size [batch_size, max_sequence_length, embedding_size] and the length of each input sequence in the batch. It returns the output of the RNN at the end of the sequence length.

The StackedRNN layer can be configured with the following arguments:
- num_units: A list specifying the number of units per layer.
- dropout: Dropout applied to the input of each cell. If list, has to dropout used for each layer. If number, the same amount of dropout is used everywhere. Defaults to 0.
- is_training: Flag to specify if the layer is used in training mode or not.
- cell_type: Specifies the type of RNN. Can be "LSTM". "GRU" is not yet implemented.
- is_bidirectional: Specifies if the stacked RNN layer is bidirectional. This is for forward compatibility, this is not yet implemented. Defaults to False.

The StackedRNN layer is implemented using the _create_regular_rnn_cell function, which creates a regular RNN cell. The function takes in the following arguments:
- num_units: A list specifying the number of units per layer.
- dropout: Dropout applied to the input of each cell. If list, has to dropout used for each layer. If number, the same amount of dropout is used everywhere. Defaults to 0.
- cell_type: Specifies the type of RNN. Can be "LSTM" or "GRU".
- is_bidirectional: Specifies if the RNN cell is bidirectional.

The _create_regular_rnn_cell function creates a bidirectional or unidirectional RNN cell based on the is_bidirectional argument. If is_bidirectional is True, it creates a bidirectional RNN cell using the _create_bidirectional_rnn_cell function. If is_bidirectional is False, it creates a unidirectional RNN cell using the _create_unidirectional_rnn_cell function.

The _create_bidirectional_rnn_cell function creates a bidirectional RNN cell. It takes in the following arguments:
- num_units: A list specifying the number of units per layer.
- dropout: Dropout applied to the input of each cell. If list, has to dropout used for each layer. If number, the same amount of dropout is used everywhere. Defaults to 0.
- cell_type: Specifies the type of RNN. Can be "LSTM" or "GRU".

The _create_bidirectional_rnn_cell function creates two lists of RNN cells, one for the forward direction and one for the backward direction. It then applies dropout to each cell if necessary. Finally, it stacks the bidirectional RNN cells using the stack_bidirectional_dynamic_rnn function from the twitter.deepbird.compat.v1.rnn module.

The _create_unidirectional_rnn_cell function creates a unidirectional RNN cell. It takes in the following arguments:
- num_units: A list specifying the number of units per layer.
- dropout: Dropout applied to the input of each cell. If list, has to dropout used for each layer. If number, the same amount of dropout is used everywhere. Defaults to 0.
- cell_type: Specifies the type of RNN. Can be "LSTM" or "GRU".

The _create_unidirectional_rnn_cell function creates a list of RNN cells and applies dropout to each cell if necessary. It then stacks the unidirectional RNN cells using the static_rnn function from the tensorflow module.

The StackedRNN layer is implemented as a subclass of the twml.layers.Layer class. It overrides the __init__, build, and call methods of the Layer class. The __init__ method initializes the StackedRNN layer with the given arguments. The build method creates the RNN cell using the _create_regular_rnn_cell function. The call method applies the RNN cell to the input tensor and returns the final output. 

The stacked_rnn function is a functional interface for the StackedRNN layer. It takes in the same arguments as the StackedRNN layer and returns the output of the RNN at the end of the sequence length. 

Overall, this code provides a flexible and efficient way to stack multiple RNN modules using a unified interface. It can be used in a variety of natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, language modeling, and machine translation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `_apply_dropout_wrapper` function?
- The function applies a dropout wrapper around each RNN cell if necessary, based on the specified dropout rate.

2. What types of RNN cells are supported by this code?
- The code supports LSTM and GRU cells, but only LSTM cells are currently implemented.

3. Is bidirectional RNN currently supported by this code?
- No, bidirectional RNN is not yet implemented and will raise a `NotImplementedError` if attempted to be used.
