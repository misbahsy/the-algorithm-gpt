The `HashingDiscretizer` layer is a TensorFlow layer that discretizes continuous features into sparse binary features. It is useful for converting sparse continuous features into sparse binary features. Each binary output feature indicates the presence of a value in a HashingDiscretizer bin. The layer is implemented in Python and C++.

The layer takes in a 2D SparseTensor as input and returns a SparseTensor as output. The input SparseTensor has a dense_shape of [batch_size, input_size]. The output SparseTensor has a dense_shape of [batch_size, 1 << output_bits]. The output_bits parameter determines the maximum value for output feature IDs.

The layer has several required and optional arguments. The required arguments are feature_ids, bin_vals, n_bin, and out_bits. The feature_ids parameter is a 1D int64 numpy array that contains a list of feature IDs that have been calibrated and have corresponding bin boundary values in the bin_vals array. The bin_vals parameter is a 1D float numpy array that contains the bin boundary values for each calibrated feature. The n_bin parameter is an integer that specifies the number of HashingDiscretizer bins. The out_bits parameter is an integer that determines the maximum value for output feature IDs.

The layer also has several optional arguments. The cost_per_unit parameter is a heuristic for intra op multithreading. The options parameter selects the behavior of the op. The default is lower_bound and integer_multiplicative_hashing. The options parameter can be set using values in twml.constants.HashingDiscretizerOptions.

The layer has two methods: build and call. The build method creates the variables of the layer. The call method implements HashingDiscretizer inference on a twml.SparseTensor. Alternatively, it accepts a tf.SparseTensor that can be converted to twml.SparseTensor. The call method performs discretization of input values. The bucket mapping depends on the calibration (i.e. the bin boundaries). However, (feature_id, bucket_val) pairs are mapped to new_feature_id in a way that is independent of the calibration procedure.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the HashingDiscretizer layer and how does it work?
- The HashingDiscretizer layer discretizes continuous features into sparse binary features using hashed feature assignments. Each calibrated input feature is converted to n_bin+1 bins, with bin assignment determined by sum(bin_vals<val). The layer is useful for transfer learning on pre-trained sparse to dense embedding layers, while re-calibrating the discretizer on newer data.

2. What are the required and optional arguments for initializing a HashingDiscretizer object?
- The required arguments are feature_ids (1D int64 numpy array), bin_vals (1D float numpy array), n_bin (int), and out_bits (int). The optional arguments are cost_per_unit (int) and options (int or None for default).

3. How does the call method of the HashingDiscretizer layer work?
- The call method implements HashingDiscretizer inference on a twml.SparseTensor or a tf.SparseTensor that can be converted to twml.SparseTensor. It performs discretization of input values by mapping (feature_id, bucket_val) pairs to new_feature_id in a way that is independent of the calibration procedure. The output is a tf.SparseTensor with dense_shape [shape_input.dense_shape[0], 1 << output_bits].
