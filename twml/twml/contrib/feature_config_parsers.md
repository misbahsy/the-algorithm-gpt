The code in this file provides utility functions to create FeatureConfig objects from feature_spec.yaml files. The FeatureConfig object is used to define the features and labels of a machine learning model. The code supports two versions of the FeatureConfig object: v1 and v2. 

The `_get_config_version` function takes a dictionary representing the feature spec and returns the version of the FeatureConfig object used. The function checks the "class" key in the dictionary to determine the version. If the "class" key is not found or the class is not supported, a ValueError is raised.

The `_validate_config_dict_v1` and `_validate_config_dict_v2` functions validate the feature spec dictionary for v1 and v2 versions of the FeatureConfig object, respectively. The functions check that the "class" and "format" keys are present and have the correct values. They also check that the required keys for each version are present and have the correct types. If the dictionary is not valid, a ValueError is raised.

The `_create_feature_config_v1` and `_create_feature_config_v2` functions create a FeatureConfig object from the feature spec dictionary for v1 and v2 versions of the FeatureConfig object, respectively. The functions extract the features, labels, and other configurations from the dictionary and add them to the FeatureConfig object. If the feature spec format is not supported, a ValueError is raised.

The `create_feature_config_from_dict` function takes a feature spec dictionary and a data spec path and returns a FeatureConfig object. The function determines the version of the FeatureConfig object used and validates the dictionary accordingly. It then creates the FeatureConfig object using the appropriate version-specific function.

The `create_feature_config` function takes a feature spec file path and a data spec path and returns a FeatureConfig object. The function reads the feature spec file and loads it into a dictionary using the PyYAML library. It then calls the `create_feature_config_from_dict` function to create the FeatureConfig object.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to create FeatureConfig objects from feature spec files, which can be used to define the features and labels of a machine learning model. The code supports two versions of the FeatureConfig object and provides validation to ensure that the feature spec is correctly formatted.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility functions to create FeatureConfig objects from feature_spec.yaml files.

2. What are the supported classes for the config_dict?
- The supported classes for the config_dict are "twml.FeatureConfig" for version 1 and "twml.contrib.FeatureConfig" for version 2.

3. What happens if the format in the config_dict is not "exported" or "manual"?
- If the format in the config_dict is not "exported" or "manual", a ValueError will be raised with the message "'format' must be 'exported' or 'manual'".
