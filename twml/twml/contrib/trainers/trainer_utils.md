The code provides a solution for TensorFlow users to use Keras models for exploration and experimentation, while using twml Trainer for production training. The `build_keras_trainer` function takes a Keras model that performs binary classification and returns a `twml.trainers.Trainer` object that performs the same task. The returned Trainer object can be used to call its `train`, `evaluate`, `learn`, or `train_and_evaluate` method with an input function. This input function can be created from the `tf.data.Dataset` used with the Keras model.

The `create_build_graph_fn` function creates a build graph function from the given Keras model. The build graph function takes in features, label, mode, params, and config as input. It creates a model from the model factory and creates a loss function if the user did not specify one. It then computes the output of the model and the loss if the mode is not 'infer'. If the output is a dictionary, it returns the output with the loss added to it. Otherwise, it returns a dictionary with the output and loss.

Overall, this code provides a way for TensorFlow users to use Keras models for exploration and experimentation, while using twml Trainer for production training. It allows for easy training of Keras models using twml Trainer and provides a build graph function to wrap Keras models.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides a temporary solution for using Keras models with TensorFlow for exploration and experimentation, while recommending the use of twml Trainer for production training and exporting.

2. What issues does `model.fit()` have in TensorFlow 1.14?
- `model.fit()` is slow, crashes during model saving or in eager mode when the input has SparseTensor, and models saved using TF 2.0 API cannot be served by TensorFlow's Java API.

3. What does the `build_keras_trainer()` function do?
- The `build_keras_trainer()` function compiles a given `model_factory` into a twml Trainer object for training and exporting models, with options for specifying loss and metrics functions, as well as other Trainer options.
