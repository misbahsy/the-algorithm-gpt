This module contains extra TensorFlow metrics used at Twitter. The module follows the conventions used by `tf.metrics.*`. Each metric constructs two subgraphs: `value_op` and `update_op`. The `value_op` is used to fetch the current metric value, while the `update_op` is used to accumulate into the metric. 

The module contains two notes. First, similar to `tf.metrics.*`, metrics in this module do not support multi-label learning. Therefore, wrapper classes must be written to create one metric per label. Second, batches added into a metric via its `update_op` are cumulative. 

The module contains several functions that return evaluation metric operations. `get_partial_multi_binary_class_metric_fn` returns evaluation metric operations for multi-binary classification tasks. `get_metric_topK_fn_helper` returns evaluation metric operations for numeric prediction performance among top K predictions. `get_numeric_metric_fn` returns evaluation metric operations for numeric prediction tasks. `get_single_binary_task_metric_fn` returns evaluation metric operations for single binary classification tasks. `get_dual_binary_tasks_metric_fn` returns evaluation metric operations for dual binary classification tasks. 

The `mean_numeric_label_topK` function returns the mean of the numeric label among the top K predictions. The `mean_gated_numeric_label_topK` function returns the mean of the gated numeric label among the top K predictions. 

Overall, this module provides additional evaluation metric operations for various machine learning tasks. These functions can be used in the larger project to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this module and how does it relate to tf.metrics?
- The purpose of this module is to contain extra tensorflow metrics used at Twitter, and it conforms to conventions used by tf.metrics.*. Each metric constructs two subgraphs: value_op and update_op.
2. What is the difference between mean_numeric_label_topK and mean_gated_numeric_label_topK?
- mean_numeric_label_topK returns the mean of the top K labels, while mean_gated_numeric_label_topK returns the mean of the top K labels that are greater than a specified threshold.
3. What is the purpose of get_single_binary_task_metric_fn and get_dual_binary_tasks_metric_fn?
- get_single_binary_task_metric_fn and get_dual_binary_tasks_metric_fn are used to get evaluation metric operations for single and dual binary tasks, respectively. They use partial_multi_binary_class_metric_fn to get the metric operations for each task and add unweighted versions of the metrics. If use_topK is True, they also add numeric metrics for the top K predictions.
