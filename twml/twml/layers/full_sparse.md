The `FullSparse` class in this code implements a fully-sparse layer for a neural network. This layer performs the operation:

```python
outputs = activation(inputs.weight + bias)
```

The class takes several arguments, such as `output_size`, `input_size`, `weight_initializer`, `bias_initializer`, `activation`, `trainable`, `name`, `use_sparse_grads`, `num_partitions`, `partition_axis`, `use_binary_values`, `bias_regularizer`, `weight_regularizer`, `use_compression`, and `use_binary_sparse_dense_matmul`. These arguments allow customization of the layer's behavior, such as the activation function, weight and bias initialization, regularization, and whether to use sparse gradients or binary values.

The `build` method creates the `bias` and `weight` variables with the specified shapes and initializers. The `compute_output_shape` method computes the output shape of the layer given the input shape, and the `call` method implements the logic of the layer, performing the matrix multiplication and applying the activation function.

The `full_sparse` function provides a functional interface for the sparsely-connected layer, taking similar arguments as the `FullSparse` class and returning a tensor of size `[batch_size x output_size]`.

This fully-sparse layer can be used in a larger project to build neural networks with sparse connections, which can be beneficial for certain types of data and problems, such as text or graph data, where the input data is inherently sparse.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `use_binary_values` parameter in the `FullSparse` class and the `full_sparse` function?
   **Answer**: The `use_binary_values` parameter is used to assume that all non-zero values are 1. This can improve training if used in conjunction with MDL (Minimum Description Length). If `inputs` passed to `call` is a list, this parameter can also be a list of binary values.

2. **Question**: How does the `use_compression` parameter affect the behavior of the `FullSparse` class?
   **Answer**: The `use_compression` parameter, when set to `True`, enables data compression techniques for optimization of network traffic for distributed training. By default, it is set to `False`.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `use_binary_sparse_dense_matmul` parameter in the `FullSparse` class?
   **Answer**: The `use_binary_sparse_dense_matmul` parameter is used to determine if the binary sparse dense matrix multiplication operation should be used. It will only be enabled if `use_binary_values` is set to `True`. It should only be used for inference, and the best practice is to set `use_binary_sparse_dense_matmul = not is_training`.
