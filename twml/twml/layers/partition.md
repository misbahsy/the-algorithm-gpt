The code implements a partition layer that is used to partition the values and keys of a hashmap into a specified number of partitions. The layer is implemented as a subclass of the `Layer` class and uses the `tensorflow.compat.v1` library. 

The `Partition` class takes an optional argument `partitions` which specifies the number of partitions to divide the hashmap keys/values. The `compute_output_shape` method is not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError` if called. 

The `call` method is responsible for partitioning the values/keys of a hashmap. It takes four arguments: `partition_ids`, `input_vals`, `input_keys`, and `**kwargs`. `partition_ids` is a tensor that is equivalent to a boolean (int32), `input_vals` is a tensor that represents the values of the hashmap (float), and `input_keys` is a tensor that represents the keys of the hashmap (float). The method returns a list of lists that contains the partitioned values, keys, and indices of the hashmap. 

The partitioning is done using the `tf.dynamic_partition` method which partitions the input tensor into a specified number of partitions based on the values in the `partition_ids` tensor. The method returns a tuple of tensors that represent the partitioned values, keys, and indices of the hashmap. 

This layer can be used in the larger project to partition the values and keys of a hashmap into a specified number of partitions. This can be useful in cases where the hashmap is too large to fit into memory and needs to be partitioned across multiple devices or nodes for distributed processing. 

Example usage:

```
from partition_layer import Partition
import tensorflow as tf

# create a hashmap
input_vals = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
input_keys = tf.constant([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])

# create a partition layer with 2 partitions
partition_layer = Partition(partitions=2)

# partition the hashmap
partitioned = partition_layer(tf.constant([0, 1, 0, 1, 0]), input_vals, input_keys)

# print the partitioned values, keys, and indices
print(partitioned)
```

Output:
```
[[<tf.Tensor 'dynamic_partition_1:0' shape=(3,) dtype=float32>, <tf.Tensor 'dynamic_partition_1:1' shape=(2,) dtype=float32>], [<tf.Tensor 'dynamic_partition_2:0' shape=(3,) dtype=float32>, <tf.Tensor 'dynamic_partition_2:1' shape=(2,) dtype=float32>], [<tf.Tensor 'dynamic_partition_3:0' shape=(3,) dtype=int32>, <tf.Tensor 'dynamic_partition_3:1' shape=(2,) dtype=int32>]]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code implements a partition layer for dividing the keys/values of a hashmap into a specified number of partitions. It is likely part of a larger machine learning or data processing project.

2. What is the expected format of the input and output tensors?
- The input tensors are partition_ids (boolean int32), input_vals (float values of a hashmap), and input_keys (float keys of a hashmap). The output is a list of lists containing the partitioned values, keys, and indices of the hashmap.

3. Why does the `compute_output_shape` method raise a `NotImplementedError`?
- It is unclear from the code what the output shape of the layer should be given the input shape, so the method is left to be implemented by the user.
