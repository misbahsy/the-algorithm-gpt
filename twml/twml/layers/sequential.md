The code defines a Sequential class that is a container for a stack of layers. It inherits from the Layer class and adds functionality to add, remove, and retrieve layers from the stack. The Sequential class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes in the TensorFlow library to build neural network models.

The Sequential class has an __init__ method that initializes the layer stack and adds any layers passed to the constructor. The add method adds a layer instance to the top of the layer stack. The pop method removes the last layer in the stack. The call method is where the logic of the layer lives and applies each layer in the stack to the input tensor(s) in sequence. The layers, layer_names, and layer_outputs properties return the layers, layer names, and layer outputs in the sequential layer, respectively. The get method retrieves the n-th layer, and the get_output method retrieves the intermediary output equivalent to the nth layer. The get_layer_by_name and get_layer_output_by_name methods retrieve the layer and layer output corresponding to the name, respectively. The init property returns a list of initialization ops (one per layer).

The Sequential class is used to build neural network models by adding layers to the stack in the desired order. For example, the following code creates a Sequential model with two dense layers:

```
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

In summary, the Sequential class is a container for a stack of layers that is used to build neural network models. It provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve layers from the stack and applies each layer in the stack to the input tensor(s) in sequence.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code implements a Sequential Layer container for a machine learning model. It is likely part of a larger project that involves building and training machine learning models.

2. What is the difference between the `add` method and the `pop` method?
- The `add` method adds a layer instance to the top of the layer stack, while the `pop` method removes the last layer in the model.

3. What is the purpose of the `get_layer_by_name` method?
- The `get_layer_by_name` method retrieves the layer corresponding to the given name. This can be useful for accessing specific layers in the model for debugging or analysis purposes.
