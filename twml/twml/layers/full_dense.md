The code implements a fully connected dense layer in TensorFlow. The `FullDense` class is a subclass of `tensorflow.python.layers.core.Dense` and wraps it. The layer takes an input tensor and applies a linear transformation to it using a weight matrix and bias vector. The output is then passed through an activation function (if provided) to produce the final output tensor. 

The `FullDense` class takes several arguments, including `output_size`, which specifies the dimensionality of the output space, `activation`, which is the activation function to be applied to the output, and `weight_initializer` and `bias_initializer`, which are the initializer functions for the weight matrix and bias vector, respectively. The class also provides several properties, such as `weight`, which returns the weight matrix, and `weight_regularizer`, which returns the regularizer function for the weight matrix.

The `full_dense` function is a functional interface for the `FullDense` layer. It takes an input tensor, `inputs`, and several arguments that are passed to the `FullDense` constructor. The function returns the output tensor produced by the `FullDense` layer.

This code can be used as a building block for neural networks that require fully connected layers, such as feedforward neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons. The `FullDense` layer can be added to a neural network architecture using the Keras API in TensorFlow. For example, the following code creates a simple feedforward neural network with two fully connected layers:

```
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

inputs = Input(shape=(input_size,))
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = Dense(32, activation='relu')(x)
outputs = Dense(output_size, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
```

In this example, `input_size` and `output_size` are the dimensions of the input and output spaces, respectively. The `Dense` layers are used to implement the fully connected layers, and the `activation` argument is used to specify the activation function for each layer. The `Model` class is used to define the input and output tensors of the neural network and create a model object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the FullDense class and how does it differ from the core_layers.Dense class?
- The FullDense class is a subclass of the core_layers.Dense class that implements a densely-connected layer with an activation function. It adds additional arguments for weight and bias regularization, as well as the ability to partition the weight matrix. 

2. What is the purpose of the build method in the FullDense class?
- The build method is responsible for creating the weight and bias variables for the layer based on the input shape. It also sets the input specification for the layer. 

3. What is the purpose of the full_dense function and how does it relate to the FullDense class?
- The full_dense function is a functional interface for creating a densely-connected layer with an activation function. It creates an instance of the FullDense class with the specified arguments and applies it to the input tensor.
