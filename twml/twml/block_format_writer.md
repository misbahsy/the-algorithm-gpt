The `BlockFormatWriter` class in this module is a wrapper for writing block format data to a file. The purpose of this class is to provide an interface for writing records to a file in a specific format, with a specified number of records per block. 

The `__init__` method initializes the class with a file name and a number of records per block. It creates a handle to the file using the `block_format_writer_create` function from the `CLIB` library. If there is an error creating the handle, a `RuntimeError` is raised. 

The `write` method writes a record to the file. It takes a class name and a record as arguments. The record must be in a format that can be converted to `ctypes.c_char_p`. The method uses the `block_format_write` function from the `CLIB` library to write the record to the file. If there is an error writing the record, a `RuntimeError` is raised. 

The `flush` method flushes any records in the buffer to the output file. It uses the `block_format_flush` function from the `CLIB` library to flush the records. If there is an error flushing the records, a `RuntimeError` is raised. 

The `__del__` method deletes the handle to the file when the object is deleted. 

This class can be used in the larger project to write block format data to a file. For example, if the project needs to store data in a specific format with a specified number of records per block, this class can be used to write the data to a file. 

Example usage:

```
writer = BlockFormatWriter("data.txt", records_per_block=50)
writer.write("Person", "John,Smith,30")
writer.write("Person", "Jane,Doe,25")
writer.flush()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a module containing a wrapper class to write block format data.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `ctypes` library and an external library called `libtwml`.

3. What input formats are accepted by the `write` method?
- The `write` method accepts a `class_name` parameter of type string and a `record` parameter that needs to be in a format that can be converted to `ctypes.c_char_p`.
