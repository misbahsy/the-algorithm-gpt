This module provides an `ExperimentTracker` class for tracking machine learning experiments in ML Metastore. The tracker records experiment runs, metrics, and exported models, and can export feature specifications to ML Metastore.

The `ExperimentTracker` class is initialized with trainer parameters, a TensorFlow RunConfig, and a save directory. It checks if the environment is eligible for tracking and if the ML Metastore packages are available. If not, tracking is disabled.

The `track_experiment` method is a context manager that wraps the training loop. It appends an experiment tracker evaluation hook to the provided list of evaluation hooks to collect metrics. The tracker is disabled if a legacy `MetricsUpdateHook` is present in the evaluation hooks.

The `create_eval_hook` method creates an evaluation hook to track evaluation metrics, while the `register_model` method records the exported model in ML Metastore. The `export_feature_spec` method exports feature specifications to ML Metastore.

The `ExperimentTracker` class also provides utility methods for generating experiment tracking paths, computing model hashes, and determining if the environment is eligible for tracking.

Here's an example of how the `ExperimentTracker` can be used:

```python
tracker = ExperimentTracker(params, run_config, save_dir)

with tracker.track_experiment(eval_hooks, get_estimator_spec_fn) as hook:
    # Training loop goes here
    pass

tracker.register_model(export_path)
tracker.export_feature_spec(feature_spec_dict)
```

This module also handles distributed and hogwild training scenarios, ensuring that only the evaluator task records experiments and the chief task records export metadata.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ExperimentTracker` class and how does it work with ML Metastore?
   **Answer**: The `ExperimentTracker` class is designed to record and track experiments during the training process in ML Metastore. It provides functionalities to record runs, update metrics, register models, and export feature specifications to ML Metastore. It also handles distributed and hogwild training scenarios.

2. **Question**: How does the `track_experiment` context manager work and what are its arguments?
   **Answer**: The `track_experiment` context manager is used to wrap the training loop and track the experiment. It appends an experiment tracker eval hook to the provided `eval_hooks` list to collect metrics. The arguments are `eval_hooks` (a list of eval_hooks to be used), `get_estimator_spec_fn` (a function to get the current EstimatorSpec of the trainer), and `name` (an optional name for the training or evaluation, used as a suffix of the run_id).

3. **Question**: How does the `register_model` method work and what is its argument?
   **Answer**: The `register_model` method records the exported model in ML Metastore. It takes an argument `export_path` which is the path to the exported model. The method computes the hash of the model and registers it in ML Metastore using the ModelRepoClient.
