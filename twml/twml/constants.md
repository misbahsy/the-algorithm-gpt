This code imports constants from a module called `twitter.deepbird.io.legacy.constants` and assigns them to variables. These constants are related to the `DecodeMode` enum class in another file called `HashedDataRecordReader.h`. 

The purpose of this code is to provide easy access to these constants in other parts of the project. By importing them into this file, other modules can simply import this file and use the constants without having to import the entire `constants` module or define the constants themselves.

For example, if another module needs to use the `DEFAULT_DECODE_MODE` constant, it can simply import this file and access the constant like this:

```
from path.to.this.file import DEFAULT_DECODE_MODE

# use the constant
print(DEFAULT_DECODE_MODE)
```

This code is a small but important part of the larger project, as it helps to keep the code organized and modular. By defining constants in one place and importing them into other modules, it reduces the amount of duplicated code and makes it easier to maintain and update the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DecodeMode` enum class in `HashedDataRecordReader.h`?
- The `DecodeMode` enum class values should coincide with the constants imported from `DECODE_MODES` in this code file.

2. What is the significance of the `noqa: F401` comments next to some of the imported constants?
- The `noqa: F401` comment is used to suppress the Flake8 error code F401, which indicates that an imported module or variable is unused.

3. What is the relevance of the `HashingDiscretizerOptions` class and the `DEFAULT_ZOOKEEPER_BASE_ZNODE` and `DEFAULT_ZOOKEEPER_HOST` constants in this code file?
- It is unclear from this code file alone what the relevance of these specific constants and class is. Further context and information about the project may be necessary to understand their purpose.
