The code in this file provides functions for managing learning rate decay in TensorFlow. Specifically, it defines a function `get_learning_rate_decay_fn` that returns a learning rate decay function based on the hyperparameters specified in a `tensorflow.contrib.train.HParams` object. The returned function takes the initial learning rate and global step as arguments and returns the current learning rate.

The function supports several types of learning rate decay, including exponential, polynomial, piecewise constant, cosine, and cosine restarts. The specific type of decay is determined by the `learning_rate_decay` parameter in the `HParams` object. If this parameter is set to `no_learning_rate_decay`, the function returns `None`.

For each type of decay, the function defines a nested function that implements the decay logic using TensorFlow's built-in decay functions. For example, if `learning_rate_decay` is set to `exponential_learning_rate_decay`, the function defines an `exponential_decay_fn` that calls `tf.train.exponential_decay` with the appropriate hyperparameters. The nested function is then returned by `get_learning_rate_decay_fn`.

The returned decay function can be used in conjunction with TensorFlow's `optimize_loss` function to apply learning rate decay during training. For example, the following code snippet shows how to use the `get_learning_rate_decay_fn` function to define a decay function and pass it to `optimize_loss`:

```
params = tf.contrib.training.HParams(
  learning_rate=0.1,
  learning_rate_decay='exponential_learning_rate_decay',
  decay_steps=1000,
  exponential_decay_rate=0.96
)

decay_fn = get_learning_rate_decay_fn(params)
learning_rate = tf.train.exponential_decay(
  learning_rate=params.learning_rate,
  global_step=global_step,
  decay_steps=params.decay_steps,
  decay_rate=params.exponential_decay_rate
)
train_op = tf.train.optimize_loss(
  loss=loss,
  global_step=global_step,
  learning_rate=learning_rate,
  optimizer='Adam',
  learning_rate_decay_fn=decay_fn
)
```

In this example, `params` specifies the hyperparameters for the decay function, and `get_learning_rate_decay_fn` returns the appropriate decay function based on the `learning_rate_decay` parameter. The returned function is then passed to `optimize_loss` via the `learning_rate_decay_fn` argument, which applies the decay function to the learning rate during training.
