This module serves as a reader for the HashedBatchPredictionRequest in the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. The HashedBatchPredictionRequest is a class that represents a batch of hashed input data to be used for prediction. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to read in and process these batches of data.

The module imports the HashedBatchPredictionRequest class from another module in the project, located at `twitter.deepbird.io.legacy.readers.hashed_batch_prediction_request`. This class is then used to read in the hashed input data.

The module itself does not contain any functions or methods, but rather serves as a way to import and use the HashedBatchPredictionRequest class. An example of how this module may be used in the larger project is as follows:

```
from twitter.deepbird.io.legacy.readers.hashed_batch_prediction_reader import HashedBatchPredictionReader

# create an instance of the reader
reader = HashedBatchPredictionReader()

# read in a batch of hashed input data
batch = reader.read_batch('path/to/batch/file')

# process the batch for prediction
prediction = model.predict(batch)
```

In this example, the HashedBatchPredictionReader is used to read in a batch of hashed input data from a file. This batch is then processed for prediction using a model in the larger project. Overall, this module serves as a crucial component in the larger project's ability to process and make predictions on large batches of hashed input data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the HashedBatchPredictionRequest and how is it used in the larger project?
   - The code only imports the HashedBatchPredictionRequest class, so a smart developer might wonder what functionality this class provides and how it fits into the overall project.
2. Why is the pylint disable statement included at the top of the file?
   - A smart developer might question why pylint is being disabled for this file and whether there are any potential issues with the code that should be addressed.
3. What other modules or classes are used in conjunction with this reader?
   - Since this module only imports one class, a smart developer might want to know what other modules or classes are used in conjunction with this reader to better understand the overall architecture of the project.
