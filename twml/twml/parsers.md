This code contains a module that provides various functions for parsing training and evaluation data. These functions can be used by modelers to customize how their datasets are parsed. The module also serves as a reference for modelers who want to create their own custom implementations of the parsing functions.

The functions in this module are imported from another module called `twitter.deepbird.io.legacy.parsers`. These functions include:

- `convert_to_supervised_input_receiver_fn`: This function converts input data into a supervised input receiver function.
- `get_continuous_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for continuous data.
- `get_default_parse_fn`: This function returns a default parsing function.
- `get_features_as_tensor_dict`: This function returns a dictionary of features as tensors.
- `get_labels_in_features_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for labels in features.
- `get_serving_input_receiver_fn_feature_dict`: This function returns a serving input receiver function for a dictionary of features.
- `get_sparse_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for sparse data.
- `get_sparse_serving_input_receiver_fn`: This function returns a serving input receiver function for sparse data.
- `get_tensor_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for tensor data.

Modelers can use these functions as the `train/eval_parse_fn` of the `DataRecordTrainer` constructor to customize how their datasets are parsed. For example, a modeler could use the `get_default_parse_fn` function to parse their data using the default parsing function. Alternatively, a modeler could create their own custom parsing function using these functions as a reference.

Overall, this module provides a set of useful functions for parsing training and evaluation data, which can be used by modelers to customize how their datasets are parsed.
## Questions:
