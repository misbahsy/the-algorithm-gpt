The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. The purpose of this function is to take a string of text as input and return a list of the most common words in that text, sorted in descending order by frequency. 

The function first converts the input string to lowercase and removes any non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions. It then splits the string into individual words using whitespace as a delimiter, and creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each word. The keys of the dictionary are the unique words in the text, and the values are the number of times each word appears. 

Next, the function uses the `collections` module to create a `Counter` object from the dictionary. This allows the function to easily sort the words by frequency, using the `most_common` method of the `Counter` object. The `most_common` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency. 

Finally, the function extracts the words from the tuples and returns them as a list, sorted in descending order by frequency. 

This function could be used in a larger project that involves analyzing text data, such as a natural language processing application or a social media sentiment analysis tool. For example, it could be used to identify the most common words in a set of tweets or customer reviews, which could provide insights into the topics or themes that are most frequently discussed. 

Example usage:

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox, but the fox keeps running."
common_words = find_most_common_words(text)
print(common_words)
```

Output:
```
['the', 'fox', 'dog', 'jumps', 'over', 'quick', 'brown', 'lazy', 'but', 'keeps', 'running', 'at', 'barks']
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `get_tweets` function retrieves a specified number of tweets from Twitter's API based on a given search query.

2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(1)` line in the `get_tweets` function?
   - The `time.sleep(1)` line adds a 1 second delay between each API request to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limit.

3. What is the purpose of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of the code?
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the code within it only runs if the file is being executed as the main program, rather than being imported as a module into another program. In this case, it runs a sample search query and prints the resulting tweets to the console.
