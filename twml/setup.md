This code is a setup script for the `twml` package, which is a Tensorflow wrapper for Twitter Machine Learning (TWML). The purpose of this script is to install the necessary dependencies and package data for the `twml` package.

The script first imports the `os` and `setuptools` modules. It then defines two variables: `THIS_DIR`, which is the directory of the current file, and `TWML_TEST_DATA_DIR`, which is the directory of the test data for the `twml` package. 

The script then creates an empty list called `data_files`. It uses a `for` loop to walk through the `TWML_TEST_DATA_DIR` directory and add each file to the `data_files` list. This list is used later to specify the package data for the `twml` package.

The `setup()` function is then called with several arguments. The `name` argument specifies the name of the package as `twml`. The `version` argument specifies the version of the package as `2.0`. The `description` argument provides a brief description of the package.

The `packages` argument specifies the packages to include in the distribution. In this case, it uses the `find_packages()` function to automatically find all packages in the `twml` directory, excluding the `build` directory.

The `install_requires` argument specifies the required dependencies for the package. These include `thriftpy2`, `numpy`, `pyyaml`, `future`, `scikit-learn`, and `scipy`.

Finally, the `package_data` argument specifies the package data for the `twml` package. It uses the `data_files` list created earlier to include all files in the `TWML_TEST_DATA_DIR` directory.

Overall, this script is used to install the `twml` package and its dependencies, as well as include the necessary package data. It can be run using the `python setup.py install` command in the command line.
