The code defines a C++ class called `BlockFormatReader` that reads binary data in a specific format. The format is not explicitly described in the code, but it appears to be a custom format used by Twitter for storing and transmitting data. The purpose of the `BlockFormatReader` class is to read data from this format and provide an interface for accessing the individual records within it.

The format consists of a series of blocks, each containing a fixed number of records. The size of each block is not fixed, but is indicated by a marker at the beginning of the block. The marker is a fixed sequence of bytes that identifies the start of a block. The size of the block is then read from the binary data and used to determine the end of the block.

Each record within a block consists of a series of fields, each with a tag and a wire type. The tag is an integer that identifies the field, and the wire type indicates the type of data that the field contains. The supported wire types are varint (for integers), 64-bit (for long integers), and length-prefixed (for strings and other variable-length data).

The `BlockFormatReader` class provides several methods for reading data from the binary format. The `next()` method reads the next record from the current block and returns true if successful. The `read_int()` method reads a 32-bit integer from the binary data. The `unpack_varint_i32()` method reads a varint-encoded integer from the binary data. The `unpack_tag_and_wiretype()` method reads a tag and wire type from the binary data. The `unpack_string()` method reads a length-prefixed string from the binary data.

The `BlockFormatReader` class is intended to be used as part of a larger project that needs to read data in this custom binary format. The class provides a convenient interface for reading the data and extracting the individual records. The larger project would likely use this class to read data from files or network streams, and then process the records as needed. For example, the project might use the `BlockFormatReader` class to read a stream of tweets from a Twitter API endpoint, and then extract the text and other metadata from each tweet for further processing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockFormatReader` class?
- The `BlockFormatReader` class is used to read binary data in a specific block format.

2. What is the significance of the `_marker` array?
- The `_marker` array is used to identify the start of a block in the binary data.

3. What exceptions can be thrown by the `read_one_record_size` method?
- The `read_one_record_size` method can throw `std::invalid_argument` exceptions with various error messages, such as "unsupported tag and wiretype" or "unsupported class name", depending on the contents of the binary data being read.
