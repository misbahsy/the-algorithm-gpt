The code is a C++ implementation of a block format writer used to write records to a file. The purpose of this code is to write records to a file in a specific format that can be read by other programs. The file format is a binary format that consists of a series of blocks, where each block contains a set number of records. Each record consists of a class name and a record payload. The class name is a string that identifies the type of record, and the record payload is a binary blob that contains the data for the record.

The BlockFormatWriter class provides methods for writing records to the file. The constructor takes a file name and the number of records per block as arguments. The write method takes a class name and a record payload as arguments and writes them to the file. The flush method flushes the current block to the file. The destructor closes the file.

The file format consists of a series of blocks. Each block starts with a marker that identifies the start of the block. The marker is a fixed-size array of bytes that is unique to this file format. After the marker, the block size is written as a 32-bit integer. The block size is the size of the block in bytes, including the marker and the block size itself. After the block size, the records are written to the file. Each record consists of a tag and a wire type, followed by the class name and the record payload. The tag and wire type are used to identify the type of data that follows. The class name is written as a length-prefixed string, where the length is a variable-length integer encoded as a varint. The record payload is also written as a length-prefixed string.

The code uses the C standard library functions for file I/O. The pack_tag_and_wiretype method writes a tag and wire type to the file. The pack_varint_i32 method writes a 32-bit integer as a varint to the file. The pack_string method writes a length-prefixed string to the file. The write_int method writes a 32-bit integer to the file. The write method writes a record to the file. The flush method flushes the current block to the file.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to write records to a file in a specific binary format. It can be used in a larger project to store and retrieve data in a structured way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `_marker` array and how is it used in the code?
    
    The `_marker` array is a static array of 16 bytes used as a marker to identify the start of a new block. It is written to the output file before each block and checked when reading the file to identify block boundaries.

2. What is the purpose of the `BlockFormatWriter` class and how is it used in the code?
    
    The `BlockFormatWriter` class is used to write records to a file in a block format. It takes a file name and a number of records per block as input and provides methods to write records to the file, flush the buffer to the file, and delete the writer object.

3. Why is the `pack_tag_and_wiretype` method using a bitwise OR operation to combine `tag` and `wiretype` values?
    
    The `pack_tag_and_wiretype` method is using a bitwise OR operation to combine `tag` and `wiretype` values because the resulting byte needs to contain both values in a specific format. The `tag` value is shifted left by 3 bits and combined with the `wiretype` value using a bitwise OR operation to produce a single byte with the tag and wire type information.
