This code defines three macros that are used for error handling and type checking in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The first macro, `HANDLE_EXCEPTIONS`, is used to catch exceptions thrown by functions and return an error code if an exception is caught. It takes a function as an argument and wraps it in a try-catch block. If a `twml::Error` exception is caught, the error message is printed to `std::cerr` and the error code is returned. If any other exception is caught, an "Unknown error" message is printed to `std::cerr` and `TWML_ERR_UNKNOWN` is returned. This macro is useful for handling errors in a consistent way throughout the project.

The second macro, `TWML_CHECK`, is used to check the return value of a function and throw a `twml::Error` exception if the return value indicates an error. It takes two arguments: the function to be checked and a message to be included in the exception if an error is detected. If the return value of the function is `TWML_ERR_NONE`, the macro does nothing. Otherwise, it throws a `twml::Error` exception with the error code and message.

The third macro, `CHECK_THRIFT_TYPE`, is used to check the type of a Thrift message. It takes three arguments: the actual type of the message, the expected type of the message, and a string indicating the name of the message. If the actual type does not match the expected type, a `twml::ThriftInvalidType` exception is thrown with the actual type, the name of the function where the check was performed, and the name of the message.

Overall, these macros provide a consistent and convenient way to handle errors and check types throughout the project. Here is an example of how they might be used:

```
void my_function(int arg) {
    HANDLE_EXCEPTIONS({
        TWML_CHECK(do_something(arg), "Error doing something");
        CHECK_THRIFT_TYPE(my_message.type, THRIFT_TYPE_STRING, "my_message");
        // do something else
    });
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HANDLE_EXCEPTIONS` macro?
- The `HANDLE_EXCEPTIONS` macro is used to catch exceptions thrown by a function and return the corresponding error code defined in `twml/Error.h`.

2. What is the purpose of the `TWML_CHECK` macro?
- The `TWML_CHECK` macro is used to check the return value of a function and throw a `twml::Error` exception with a custom error message if the return value is not `TWML_ERR_NONE`.

3. What is the purpose of the `CHECK_THRIFT_TYPE` macro?
- The `CHECK_THRIFT_TYPE` macro is used to check if a given Thrift type matches an expected type and throw a `twml::ThriftInvalidType` exception with the actual type value, function name, and expected type if they do not match.
