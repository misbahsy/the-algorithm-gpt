This code is a configuration file that specifies a list of files to exclude from a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The excluded files are those with the filename "murmur_hash3.cpp". 

The purpose of this configuration file is to ensure that the excluded files are not included in the build process of the larger project. This is important because the excluded files may contain code that is not necessary for the project or may cause conflicts with other parts of the project. 

To use this configuration file, it should be placed in the root directory of the project and named "exclude_files". The list of excluded files can be modified by adding or removing filenames from the list. 

For example, if the project contains a file called "test.cpp" that should also be excluded, the configuration file can be modified as follows:

```
exclude_files=murmur_hash3.cpp,test.cpp
```

Overall, this configuration file serves as a tool for managing the build process of the larger project by excluding unnecessary or conflicting files.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\
A smart developer might wonder what the overall goal of this code is and how it fits into the larger project. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the specific purpose of this line of code.

2. **What is the significance of excluding "murmur_hash3.cpp"?**\
A smart developer might question why this particular file is being excluded and what impact it has on the rest of the project. They may also want to know if there are any other files being excluded and why.

3. **What other configuration options are available?**\
A smart developer might be interested in knowing what other configuration options are available for this project and how they can be used to customize the behavior of the algorithm. They may also want to know where to find documentation on these options.
