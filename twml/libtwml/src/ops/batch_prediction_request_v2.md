This code defines two TensorFlow operations for decoding batch prediction requests and creating handles to the resulting data records. The first operation, `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2`, is used for training instead of serving, and requires the `label_features` and `weight_features` attributes to be passed, as labels and weights are extracted in the output. This operation controls what data records are processed together in a batch during training. The second operation, `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2`, is used for serving and creates a handle to the resulting data records.

Both operations use the `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestKernel` class, which is a template class that takes two type parameters: `InputType` and `RecordType`. The `InputType` parameter specifies the type of the input tensor, which can be either `uint8` or `string`. The `RecordType` parameter specifies the type of the resulting data records, which can be either `twml::DataRecord` or `twml::HashedDataRecord`.

The `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestKernel` class defines a constructor that initializes several private member variables, including `m_keep_map`, `m_labels_map`, `m_weights_map`, and `m_decode_mode`. These member variables are used to decode the input tensor and extract the desired features. The `DecodeBatchPredictionKernel` class also defines a `Decode` method that takes an `OpKernelContext` object and a `ResourceType` object as input, and decodes the input tensor into a batch of data records.

The `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` and `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2` classes inherit from the `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestKernel` class and override the `Compute` method to create a handle to the resulting data records. The `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` class is used for training and creates a handle to a batch of hashed data records, while the `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2` class is used for serving and creates a handle to a batch of data records.

Overall, this code provides a way to decode batch prediction requests and extract the desired features for use in training or serving machine learning models.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines two TensorFlow operations, `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` and `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2`, which decode a batch of serialized data records and create a handle to the batch of hashed or unhashed data records, respectively.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of these operations?
- Both operations take a tensor `input_bytes` containing the serialized batch of data records as input, along with several attributes specifying which features to keep, which to use as labels or weights, and how to decode the data. The output of `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` is a resource handle to the batch of hashed data records, while the output of `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2` is a resource handle to the batch of unhashed data records.

3. What is the difference between `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` and `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2`?
- `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` is used for training instead of serving, and thus requires the `label_features` attribute to be passed, while `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2` does not. Additionally, `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequestV2` creates a handle to the batch of hashed data records, while `DecodeBatchPredictionRequestV2` creates a handle to the batch of unhashed data records.
