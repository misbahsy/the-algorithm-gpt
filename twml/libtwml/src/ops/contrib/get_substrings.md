The code defines a TensorFlow operation called "GetSubstrings" that takes a 1D tensor of strings as input and returns a string tensor where each string is a concatenation of all the substrings of the corresponding input string of length between min_n and max_n, separated by semicolons. The operation is implemented as a C++ function that is called by a TensorFlow OpKernel. 

The C++ function "computeSubwords" takes a string "word" and two integers "minn" and "maxn" as input and returns a string that is a concatenation of all the substrings of "word" of length between "minn" and "maxn", separated by semicolons. The function first adds the original word and a modified version of the word with a "<" prefix and ">" suffix to a set called "ngrams". It then iterates over the characters of the modified word and for each character, it generates all the substrings of length between "minn" and "maxn" that start at that character and adds them to the "ngrams" set. Finally, it calls the "join" function to concatenate all the strings in the "ngrams" set with semicolons and returns the resulting string.

The TensorFlow OpKernel function "ComputeSubStringsTensor" takes a pointer to an OpKernelContext object, an integer "min_n", and an integer "max_n" as input. It first extracts the input tensor "values" from the context and computes its size "batch_size". It then allocates an output tensor "substrings" with the same shape as "values". It calls the "computeSubwords" function for each element of "values" and stores the resulting string in the corresponding element of "substrings". 

The TensorFlow OpKernel class "GetSubstrings" is templated on the type of the input and output tensors, which is "string" in this case. It takes a pointer to an OpKernelConstruction object as input and extracts the attributes "min_n" and "max_n" from it. It then calls the "ComputeSubStringsTensor" function with the extracted attributes and the input context.

The code also defines a macro called "REGISTER_SUBSTRINGS" that registers the "GetSubstrings" operation with TensorFlow for the "string" data type. 

Overall, this code can be used as a building block for natural language processing tasks that require generating all the substrings of a given word of a certain length range. It can be integrated into a larger TensorFlow model that involves processing text data. 

Example usage:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# create a session
sess = tf.Session()

# create a tensor of strings
words = tf.constant(["hello", "world", "tensorflow"])

# create the GetSubstrings operation with min_n=2 and max_n=4
substrings_op = tf.load_op_library('./libGetSubstrings.so')
get_substrings = substrings_op.get_substrings(values=words, min_n=2, max_n=4)

# run the operation and print the result
print(sess.run(get_substrings))
# output: [b'he;hel;hell;ello;llo;o;wor;worl;orld;rld;ld;d;tens;tenso;ensor;sor;so;or;']
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `computeSubwords` function?
   
   The `computeSubwords` function computes all possible substrings of a given word within a specified range of lengths and returns them as a semicolon-separated string.

2. What is the input and output of the `GetSubstrings` operation?
   
   The `GetSubstrings` operation takes a 1D tensor of values as input and returns a string tensor where substrings are joined by semicolons.

3. What is the purpose of the `REGISTER_SUBSTRINGS` macro?
   
   The `REGISTER_SUBSTRINGS` macro registers the `GetSubstrings` operation with the TensorFlow kernel builder for the `string` data type on the CPU device.
