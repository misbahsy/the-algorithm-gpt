This code is a simple script that retrieves the path of headers for the current Tensorflow library. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way for developers to access the headers needed to build Tensorflow applications. 

The code imports the Tensorflow library using the alias `tf`, and then calls the `sysconfig.get_include()` method to retrieve the path of the headers. The `end=''` parameter is used to prevent the `print()` function from adding a newline character at the end of the output. 

This code can be used in the larger project to simplify the process of building Tensorflow applications. Developers can use the output of this script to set the include path for their build system, which will allow them to compile and link their code against the Tensorflow library. 

Here is an example of how this code can be used in a build script:

```
import subprocess
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf

# Get the path of Tensorflow headers
include_path = tf.sysconfig.get_include()

# Build the application
subprocess.run(['gcc', '-I', include_path, 'my_app.c', '-ltensorflow'])
```

In this example, the `include_path` variable is set to the path of the Tensorflow headers, which is then passed to the `gcc` compiler using the `-I` flag. This allows the compiler to find the necessary header files when building the application. The `-ltensorflow` flag is used to link against the Tensorflow library. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and convenient way for developers to access the headers needed to build Tensorflow applications, which can help streamline the development process.
## Questions: 
 1. What version of Tensorflow is being used in this code?
- The code is using Tensorflow version 1, as indicated by the import statement `import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf`.

2. What does `tf.sysconfig.get_include()` return?
- `tf.sysconfig.get_include()` returns the path of headers for the current Tensorflow library.

3. What is the purpose of printing the result of `tf.sysconfig.get_include()`?
- The purpose of printing the result of `tf.sysconfig.get_include()` is likely for debugging or troubleshooting purposes, as it allows the developer to verify the path of headers being used by the current Tensorflow library.
