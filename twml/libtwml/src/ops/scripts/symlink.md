This code is a shell script that creates a symbolic link to a library called `_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so` in order to properly link it with the `libtwml_tf_data.so` library. The purpose of this script is to ensure that the `libtensorflow_internal.so` library is linked correctly with the `libtwml_tf_data.so` library, which is only needed for streaming datasets and will not be used at runtime.

The script first sets the `TF_PYTHON_LIB_DIR` variable to the directory where the `_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so` library is located. This is done using the `get_lib.py` script located in the `tensorflow/src/scripts` directory. The `PEX_INTERPRETER=1` flag is used to ensure that the script is run using the PEX interpreter.

Next, the script sets the `TF_INTERNAL_LIB` variable to the path of the `libtensorflow_internal.so` library. It then removes any existing symbolic link to this library using the `rm -f` command.

Finally, the script creates a new symbolic link to the `_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so` library using the `ln -s` command. This ensures that the `libtensorflow_internal.so` library is properly linked with the `_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so` library.

Overall, this script is a small but important part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It ensures that the necessary libraries are linked correctly, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script creates a symlink to _pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so to allow cmake to link with the library properly. The library is only needed for streaming datasets and is linked with libtwml_tf_data.so which will not be used at runtime.

2. What is the significance of the TF_PYTHON_LIB_DIR variable?
    
    The TF_PYTHON_LIB_DIR variable is used to store the path to the directory containing the python library for TensorFlow.

3. What is the role of the get_lib.py script?
    
    The get_lib.py script is used to retrieve the path to the TensorFlow library directory.
