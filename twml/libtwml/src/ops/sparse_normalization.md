The code defines four custom TensorFlow operations for normalizing sparse inputs: SparseMaxNorm, SparseBatchNorm, SparseMaxNormInference, and SparseMaxNormTraining. These operations are designed to work with sparse tensors, which are tensors that contain mostly zeros. 

The SparseMaxNorm operation normalizes a batch of sparse inputs based on the current maximum value. It takes four inputs: max_values, indices, values, and is_training. The max_values input is a float tensor variable representing the max values seen so far. The indices input is an int64 tensor representing indices representing a feature. The values input is a float tensor representing values for the current batch. The is_training input is a bool tensor specifying if the op should be run in training mode or not. The output of the operation is a tuple of two tensors: updated_max_values and normalized_values. The updated_max_values tensor is max_values updated with the current batch. The normalized_values tensor is input values normalized by the max value seen so far.

The SparseBatchNorm operation performs batch normalization on sparse inputs. It takes six inputs: means, variances, indices, values, is_training, and two attributes: input_size and epsilon. The means input is a float tensor variable representing the running mean seen so far. The variances input is a float tensor variable representing the running variance seen so far. The indices input is an int64 tensor representing indices representing a feature. The values input is a float tensor representing values for the current batch. The is_training input is a bool tensor specifying if the op should be run in training mode or not. The input_size attribute is the size of the inputs. The epsilon attribute is the minimum value of the variance. The output of the operation is a tuple of three tensors: updated_means, updated_vars, and normalized_values. The updated_means tensor is means updated with the current batch. The updated_vars tensor is variances updated with the current batch. The normalized_values tensor is input values normalized by the max value seen so far.

The SparseMaxNormInference operation normalizes a batch of sparse inputs based on the current maximum value. This is the inference version of the SparseMaxNorm operation. It takes three inputs: max_values, indices, and values. The max_values input is a float tensor representing the max values seen so far. The indices input is an int64 tensor representing indices representing a feature. The values input is a float tensor representing values for the current batch. The output of the operation is a tensor: normalized_values. The normalized_values tensor is input values normalized by the max value seen so far.

The SparseMaxNormTraining operation normalizes a batch of sparse inputs based on the current maximum value. This is the training version of the SparseMaxNorm operation. It takes three inputs: max_values, indices, and values. The max_values input is a float tensor variable representing the max values seen so far. The indices input is an int64 tensor representing indices representing a feature. The values input is a float tensor representing values for the current batch. The output of the operation is a tuple of two tensors: updated_max_values and normalized_values. The updated_max_values tensor is max_values updated with the current batch. The normalized_values tensor is input values normalized by the max value seen so far.

Overall, these operations are useful for normalizing sparse inputs in TensorFlow models. They can be used in a variety of applications, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the SparseMaxNorm and SparseBatchNorm ops?
- The SparseMaxNorm op normalizes a batch of sparse inputs based on the current maximum value, while the SparseBatchNorm op performs batch normalization.
2. What is the difference between the SparseMaxNormInference and SparseMaxNormTraining ops?
- The SparseMaxNormInference op is used during inference to normalize a batch of sparse inputs based on the maximum value seen so far, while the SparseMaxNormTraining op is used during training to update the maximum value seen so far and normalize the input values accordingly.
3. What is the purpose of the epsilon attribute in these ops?
- The epsilon attribute is used to prevent division by zero when normalizing the input values. It represents the minimum value of the variance in the SparseBatchNorm op and the minimum value of the maximum value seen so far in the SparseMaxNorm ops.
