The code defines two TensorFlow operations for decoding batch prediction requests and creating handles to the resulting data records. The first operation, `DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequest`, takes as input a serialized batch of `BatchPredictionRequest` and decodes it into a batch of `HashedDataRecords`. The operation also creates a handle to the resulting `HashedDataRecordResource`. The operation has several attributes, including `keep_features`, a list of integer ids to keep, `keep_codes`, their corresponding codes, and `decode_mode`, an integer indicating which decoding method to use. The operation uses the `twml` library to perform the decoding and hashing.

The second operation, `DecodeBatchPredictionRequest`, is similar to the first but creates a handle to the resulting `DataRecordResource` instead of `HashedDataRecordResource`. The operation also has `keep_features` and `keep_codes` attributes.

Both operations use the `OpKernel` class to define their behavior. The `Compute` method of each operation performs the decoding and creates the resource handle. The `makeResourceHandle` function is used to create the handle, and the decoded data is stored in the corresponding resource object. The `m_keep_map` member variable is used to map feature ids to codes.

These operations are likely used in a larger project for processing batch prediction requests. The decoded data records can be used as input to a machine learning model for making predictions. The hashing of the data records may be used to reduce the dimensionality of the input data and improve the efficiency of the prediction process. The `keep_features` and `keep_codes` attributes allow the user to specify which features to keep in the data records, which can be useful for reducing the size of the input data and improving the efficiency of the model.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines two TensorFlow OPs for decoding batch prediction requests and creating handles to the batch of data records or hashed data records. It solves the problem of efficiently processing large amounts of data for batch prediction tasks.

2. What are the input and output data types for these OPs?
- The input data type for both OPs is uint8, which contains the serialized batch of BatchPredictionRequest. The output data type for DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequest is a resource handle to the HashedDataRecordResource, while the output data type for DecodeBatchPredictionRequest is a resource handle to the DataRecordResource.

3. What is the difference between the two OPs and how do they handle the input data?
- The main difference between the two OPs is that DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequest creates a handle to the batch of hashed data records, while DecodeBatchPredictionRequest creates a handle to the batch of data records. DecodeAndHashBatchPredictionRequest also has an additional attribute for specifying the decoding method to use. Both OPs store the input bytes in the resource so that it isn't freed before the resource, and use a reader to decode the input data into a BatchPredictionRequest object.
