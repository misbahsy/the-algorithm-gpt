This code is a configuration file for the Python package distribution tool, setuptools. Specifically, it sets options for the `bdist_wheel`, `build`, and `bdist` commands. 

The `bdist_wheel` command creates a Python wheel distribution, which is a built package format that can be installed with pip. The `universal=1` option specifies that the wheel is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. 

The `build` command sets the directory where the build output will be stored. The `build-lib` option specifies the directory for built libraries, and the `build-temp` option specifies the directory for temporary build files. 

The `bdist` command creates a binary distribution package, which can be installed on systems without a Python interpreter. The `bdist-base` option sets the directory where the build output will be stored. 

Overall, this configuration file sets options for building and distributing a Python package. It is likely used in conjunction with other code files to create a complete package that can be installed and used by others. 

Example usage:
```
# Install setuptools
pip install setuptools

# Build the package
python setup.py bdist_wheel

# Create a binary distribution package
python setup.py bdist
```
