This code provides two functions for mixing integer and string values with a given key to generate a new key. These functions are intended to be used in the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter.

The first function, `mixDiscreteIdAndValue`, takes two integer values, `key` and `value`, and performs a bitwise XOR operation on `key` with the result of a multiplication and addition operation on `value`. The multiplication and addition operation is performed on a constant value of `17LL` and `2654435761LL` respectively. The resulting value is then returned as the new key.

The second function, `mixStringIdAndValue`, takes three arguments: `key`, `str_len`, and `str`. `key` is an integer value representing the original key, `str_len` is an integer value representing the length of the string `str`, and `str` is a pointer to an array of unsigned 8-bit integers representing the string to be mixed with the key. The function then performs a hash operation on the string using the djb2 algorithm, which involves multiplying the current hash value by 31 and adding the next character in the string. The resulting hash value is then XORed with the original key to generate the new key, which is then returned.

These functions can be used in various ways within The Algorithm from Twitter project, such as generating unique keys for data structures or hashing values for use in algorithms. Here is an example of how `mixDiscreteIdAndValue` could be used to generate a unique key for a hash table:

```
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
#include "mixer.h"

int main() {
  std::unordered_map<int64_t, std::string> my_map;
  int64_t key = 123456789;
  std::string value = "hello world";
  int64_t new_key = twml::mixDiscreteIdAndValue(key, value.length());
  my_map[new_key] = value;
  std::cout << "New key: " << new_key << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Value: " << my_map[new_key] << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an unordered map with keys of type `int64_t` and values of type `std::string`. We then generate a new key using `mixDiscreteIdAndValue` by passing in the original key and the length of the string value. We use the new key to insert the string value into the map and then print out the new key and the value associated with it.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `mixDiscreteIdAndValue` function?
- The `mixDiscreteIdAndValue` function is used to mix a discrete ID and a value into a single 64-bit integer key.

2. What is the purpose of the `mixStringIdAndValue` function?
- The `mixStringIdAndValue` function is used to mix a string ID and a value into a single 64-bit integer key.

3. What is the significance of the `#pragma once` and `#ifdef __cplusplus` statements?
- The `#pragma once` statement ensures that the header file is only included once during compilation, while the `#ifdef __cplusplus` statement checks if the code is being compiled as C++ and wraps the code in a namespace if it is.
