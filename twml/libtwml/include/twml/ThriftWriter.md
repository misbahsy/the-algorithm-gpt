The `ThriftWriter` class in this file is a low-level binary writer for the Thrift protocol. Thrift is a binary protocol used for efficient communication between services, and this class is designed to write binary Thrift data to a buffer. 

The class has a constructor that takes a buffer, buffer size, and a boolean flag for dry run mode. In dry run mode, the class counts the number of bytes that would be written without actually copying any memory. This is useful for determining the output size for TensorFlow allocations. 

The class provides several methods for encoding headers and values into the buffer. These include methods for writing struct field headers, struct stops, list headers, map headers, doubles, integers of various sizes, binary data, strings, and booleans. 

The `write` method is a template method that writes a value of any type to the buffer. It is used internally by the other methods to write values to the buffer. 

Overall, this class is a building block for working with the Thrift protocol in C++. It provides a low-level interface for writing binary Thrift data to a buffer, which can then be used for communication between services. 

Example usage:

```c++
#include <twml/ThriftWriter.h>

// create a buffer to write Thrift data to
uint8_t buffer[1024];

// create a ThriftWriter object with the buffer and buffer size
twml::ThriftWriter writer(buffer, sizeof(buffer));

// write a struct field header to the buffer
writer.writeStructFieldHeader(1, 1);

// write an integer value to the buffer
writer.writeInt32(42);

// write a struct stop to the buffer
writer.writeStructStop();

// get the total number of bytes written to the buffer
uint64_t bytes_written = writer.getBytesWritten();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a low-level binary Thrift writer that can write binary Thrift to a buffer and compute output size in dry run mode without copying memory. It is useful for generating valid Thrift by following the Thrift binary protocol.

2. What are the parameters of the ThriftWriter constructor and what do they do?
- The ThriftWriter constructor takes in a buffer (memory to write the binary Thrift to), buffer_size (length of the buffer), and dry_run (a boolean that determines whether to just count bytes 'written' but do not copy memory or write binary Thrift to the buffer normally). The dry_run parameter is useful to determine output size for TensorFlow allocations.

3. What are some of the methods available in the ThriftWriter class and what do they do?
- The ThriftWriter class has methods for encoding headers and values into the buffer, such as writeStructFieldHeader, writeStructStop, writeListHeader, writeMapHeader, writeDouble, writeInt8, writeInt16, writeInt32, writeInt64, writeBinary, writeString, and writeBool. These methods write different types of data to the buffer in accordance with the Thrift binary protocol.
