The `DataRecordWriter` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to encode `DataRecords` as binary Thrift. This class is used by the `BatchPredictionResponse` class to encode prediction responses through the TensorFlow response writer operator.

The `DataRecordWriter` class has several private methods that are used to write different types of data to the binary Thrift format. These methods include `writeBinary`, `writeContinuous`, `writeDiscrete`, `writeString`, `writeSparseBinaryFeatures`, `writeSparseContinuousFeatures`, `writeBlobFeatures`, and `writeDenseTensors`. Each of these methods takes a `DataRecord` object as input and writes the corresponding data to the binary Thrift format.

The `DataRecordWriter` class has a public constructor that takes a `ThriftWriter` object as input. This constructor initializes the `m_records_written` variable to 0 and sets the `m_thrift_writer` and `m_tensor_writer` variables to the input `ThriftWriter` object and a new `TensorRecordWriter` object, respectively.

The `DataRecordWriter` class also has a public method called `write` that takes a `DataRecord` object as input and returns a `uint64_t` value. This method calls the private methods to write the different types of data to the binary Thrift format and returns the number of records that have been written.

Overall, the `DataRecordWriter` class is an important component of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project as it is used to encode `DataRecords` as binary Thrift, which is a widely used serialization format. This class can be used by other classes in the project to write data to the binary Thrift format, which can then be used for various purposes such as data storage and transmission. 

Example usage:

```
twml::ThriftWriter thrift_writer;
twml::DataRecordWriter data_record_writer(thrift_writer);
twml::DataRecord data_record;

// populate data_record with data

uint64_t num_records_written = data_record_writer.write(data_record);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `DataRecordWriter` that encodes `DataRecords` as binary Thrift. It is used to encode prediction responses through a TensorFlow response writer operator.

2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several other classes and dependencies from the `twml` namespace, including `defines.h`, `DataRecord.h`, `TensorRecordWriter.h`, and `ThriftWriter`.

3. What methods does the `DataRecordWriter` class have and what do they do?
- The `DataRecordWriter` class has several private methods that write different types of data to the binary Thrift output. It also has a public method called `write` that takes a `DataRecord` object and writes it to the output. Another public method called `getRecordsWritten` returns the number of records that have been written so far.
