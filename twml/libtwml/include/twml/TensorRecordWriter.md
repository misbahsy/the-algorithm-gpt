The `TensorRecordWriter` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to encode tensors as DataRecord/TensorRecord-compatible Thrift. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to write tensor fields in a format that can be used by the `DataRecordWriter` class. 

The `TensorRecordWriter` class has a private member variable `m_records_written` that keeps track of the number of records written and a reference to a `ThriftWriter` object `m_thrift_writer` that is used to write the encoded tensor fields. The class has two private methods `writeTensor` and `writeRawTensor` that are used to write the tensor fields in the appropriate format. 

The `TensorRecordWriter` class has a public constructor that takes a reference to a `ThriftWriter` object as an argument. The constructor initializes the private member variables `m_records_written` to 0 and `m_thrift_writer` to the passed `ThriftWriter` object. The class also has a public method `getRecordsWritten` that returns the number of records written by the `TensorRecordWriter` object.

The main public method of the `TensorRecordWriter` class is `write`, which takes a reference to a `TensorRecord` object as an argument. The `write` method writes the tensor fields of the `TensorRecord` object in the appropriate format using the `ThriftWriter` object. The caller of the `write` method must precede it with a struct header field like `thrift_writer.writeStructFieldHeader(TTYPE_MAP, DR_GENERAL_TENSOR)`.

All tensors written by the `write` method are written as `RawTensors` except for `StringTensors`. The `TensorRecordWriter` class is used in conjunction with the `DataRecordWriter` class to encode tensor fields in a format that can be used by the `DataRecord` class. 

Example usage:

```
twml::ThriftWriter thrift_writer;
twml::TensorRecordWriter tensor_writer(thrift_writer);
twml::TensorRecord tensor_record;

// set tensor_record fields

uint64_t num_records_written = tensor_writer.write(tensor_record);
uint32_t num_records = tensor_writer.getRecordsWritten();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?
- This code is a class called `TensorRecordWriter` that encodes tensors as Thrift-compatible data records. It is used by `DataRecordWriter` to encode tensor fields.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `twml/defines.h` and `twml/TensorRecord.h` headers, as well as a `twml::ThriftWriter` object.

3. What is the expected output of the `write` function and how is it used?
- The `write` function returns a `uint64_t` representing the number of bytes written. It is called by the caller (usually `DataRecordWriter`) after writing a struct header field, and writes the tensor data as `RawTensors` except for `StringTensors`.
