The `FrsTweetCandidateGenerator` class is a component of the Twitter Content Recommender Mixer project. It is responsible for generating tweet candidates based on seed users from the FRS (Follow Recommendation Service) and retrieving their past tweets from Earlybird with Earlybird light ranking models. 

The class has a `get` method that takes a `FrsTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery` object as input and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `FrsTweet` objects. The `FrsTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery` object contains the user ID, product, impressed user list, impressed tweet list, language code, country code, and maximum number of results. 

The `get` method retrieves the candidate for the given user by performing the following steps:
1. Fetching seed users from FRS.
2. Fetching tweet candidates from Earlybird.
3. Filtering candidates that do not pass the visibility filter policy.
4. Hydrating the candidates with the FRS candidate sources and scores.
5. Truncating the candidates to the maximum number of results.

The class has four private methods that perform the above steps:
1. `fetchSeeds` method fetches recommended seed users from FRS.
2. `fetchCandidates` method fetches tweet candidates from Earlybird.
3. `filterCandidates` method filters candidates that do not pass the visibility filter policy.
4. `hydrateCandidates` method hydrates the candidates with the FRS candidate sources and scores.

The class has several private variables that are used to track the statistics of each step. The `stats` variable is used to track the statistics of the entire class. The `fetchSeedsStats`, `fetchCandidatesStats`, `filterCandidatesStats`, `hydrateCandidatesStats`, and `getCandidatesStats` variables are used to track the statistics of each step.

The `FrsTweetCandidateGenerator` class is a singleton class that is injected with the `frsStore`, `frsBasedSimilarityEngine`, `tweetInfoStore`, `timeoutConfig`, and `globalStats` objects. The `frsStore` object is a readable store of FRS queries. The `frsBasedSimilarityEngine` object is an Earlybird similarity engine router. The `tweetInfoStore` object is a readable store of tweet information. The `timeoutConfig` object is a configuration object for timeouts. The `globalStats` object is a stats receiver object for tracking statistics.

Example usage:
```
val frsTweetCandidateGenerator = new FrsTweetCandidateGenerator(frsStore, frsBasedSimilarityEngine, tweetInfoStore, timeoutConfig, globalStats)
val frsTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery = FrsTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery(userId, product, impressedUserList, impressedTweetList, languageCodeOpt, countryCodeOpt, maxNumResults)
val result = frsTweetCandidateGenerator.get(frsTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a TweetCandidateGenerator based on FRS seed users that fetches seed users from FRS and retrieves the seed users' past tweets from Earlybird with Earlybird light ranking models. It solves the problem of generating tweet candidates for a given user based on their past behavior and preferences.

2. What dependencies does this code have and what do they do?
- This code has dependencies on various libraries such as com.twitter.contentrecommender.thriftscala, com.twitter.cr_mixer.config, com.twitter.cr_mixer.model, com.twitter.cr_mixer.param, com.twitter.cr_mixer.similarity_engine, com.twitter.cr_mixer.source_signal, com.twitter.finagle.stats, com.twitter.finagle.util, com.twitter.frigate.common.util, com.twitter.hermit.constants, com.twitter.hermit.model, com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common, com.twitter.storehaus, com.twitter.timelines.configapi, javax.inject, and javax.inject.Singleton. These libraries provide functionality for handling data, storing and retrieving information, and managing dependencies.

3. What is the main function of this code and how is it implemented?
- The main function of this code is to retrieve the candidate for the given user by fetching seed user from FRS, candidate from Earlybird, filtering, candidate hydration, and truncation. It is implemented using a series of private functions such as fetchSeeds, fetchCandidates, filterCandidates, and hydrateCandidates, which are called within the get function. The get function takes in a FrsTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery object and returns a Future of a sequence of FrsTweet objects.
