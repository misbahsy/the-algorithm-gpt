The `CrMixerLoggingABDecider` class is a wrapper around the `LoggingABDecider` class that logs all impressed buckets to a `LocalContext` on a given request. The purpose of this class is to store state/variables without having to pass these variables all around the request. 

The `LoggingABDecider` class is a part of the `abdecider` library, which is used for A/B testing. The `CrMixerLoggingABDecider` class extends the `LoggingABDecider` class and overrides its methods to log all impressed buckets to a concurrent hashmap. The `impression` method logs the bucket information to the concurrent hashmap and increments a counter in the `StatsReceiver` object. The `track` and `bucket` methods are passed through to the `LoggingABDecider` class. The `experiments` and `experiment` methods return the experiments and experiment names from the `LoggingABDecider` class.

The `CrMixerImpressedBuckets` object provides a way to get all impressed buckets for a given request. It uses a `Local` object to store a concurrent hashmap of impressed buckets for each request. The `getAllImpressedBuckets` method returns a list of all impressed buckets for the current request. The `recordImpressedBucket` method is called by the `CrMixerLoggingABDecider` class to record the impressed bucket in the concurrent hashmap.

This code is used in the larger `CrMixer` project, which is a feature switch library used by Twitter. The purpose of the `CrMixer` project is to provide a way to enable or disable features in a service without having to redeploy the service. The `CrMixerLoggingABDecider` class is used to log all impressed buckets for A/B testing, which is a common use case for feature switches. The `CrMixerImpressedBuckets` object is used to get all impressed buckets for a given request, which can be used to analyze the results of an A/B test.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Scala package that wraps a LoggingABDecider to record impressed buckets to a 'LocalContext' on a given request.

2. What other packages or dependencies are required for this code to work?
- This code requires dependencies from com.twitter.finagle.stats, com.twitter.abdecider, and com.twitter.frigate.common.util.

3. How are impressed buckets stored and retrieved in this code?
- Impressed buckets are stored in a concurrent hashmap and recorded to a 'LocalContext' on a given request. They can be retrieved using the getAllImpressedBuckets method.
