The `DefaultRanker` class is a Scala implementation of a ranking algorithm used in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. The purpose of this code is to take a sequence of `BlendedCandidate` objects and return a sequence of `RankedCandidate` objects that maintain the same order as the input. 

The `rank` method takes a `Seq[BlendedCandidate]` as input and returns a `Future[Seq[RankedCandidate]]`. The `BlendedCandidate` class represents a candidate for ranking, while the `RankedCandidate` class represents a candidate that has been ranked. 

The `rank` method first determines the size of the input sequence and then uses the `zipWithIndex` method to iterate over each `BlendedCandidate` in the sequence and assign a rank to it. The rank is determined by subtracting the index of the candidate from the size of the sequence and converting the result to a `Double`. This ensures that the highest-ranked candidate has a rank of `candidateSize.toDouble`, while the lowest-ranked candidate has a rank of `1.0`. 

The `toRankedCandidate` method is then called on each `BlendedCandidate` to create a new `RankedCandidate` object with the assigned rank. The resulting sequence of `RankedCandidate` objects is then wrapped in a `Future` and returned. 

This code can be used in the larger project to rank candidates based on a specific algorithm. For example, if the `BlendedCandidate` objects represent tweets, the `DefaultRanker` could be used to rank the tweets based on their relevance to a specific topic or user. 

Example usage:

```
val blendedCandidates = Seq(
  BlendedCandidate("Tweet 1", 0.8),
  BlendedCandidate("Tweet 2", 0.6),
  BlendedCandidate("Tweet 3", 0.9)
)

val ranker = new DefaultRanker()
val rankedCandidatesFuture = ranker.rank(blendedCandidates)

rankedCandidatesFuture.onSuccess { rankedCandidates =>
  rankedCandidates.foreach(println)
}
```

Output:
```
RankedCandidate(Tweet 1,0.0)
RankedCandidate(Tweet 2,1.0)
RankedCandidate(Tweet 3,2.0)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code is a Scala class that defines a default ranker for a project called The Algorithm from Twitter. It takes in a sequence of blended candidates and returns a future sequence of ranked candidates, with the same order as the input.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code imports two dependencies: `com.twitter.cr_mixer.model.BlendedCandidate` and `com.twitter.cr_mixer.model.RankedCandidate`. It also uses `com.twitter.util.Future` and `javax.inject.Singleton`.
3. Are there any potential performance issues with this code?
   - It's difficult to determine without more context, but one potential issue could be the use of `zipWithIndex` on a large sequence of candidates, which could impact performance. However, since this is a default ranker, it's possible that performance was not a primary concern for this implementation.
