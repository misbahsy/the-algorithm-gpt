The `ContentSignalBlender` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for blending multiple types of sorting algorithms relying only on content-based signals. The class takes in a set of parameters and a sequence of initial candidates and returns a sequence of blended candidates. The blending process involves filtering out empty candidate sequences, sorting the candidates based on the selected sorting algorithm, removing duplicates, and building blended candidates.

The `blend` method is the main method of the class and takes in two parameters: `params` and `inputCandidates`. The `params` parameter is an instance of the `Params` class and contains the parameters required for blending. The `inputCandidates` parameter is a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects. The method first filters out empty candidate sequences and then sorts the candidates based on the selected sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithm can be one of the following: `CandidateRecency`, `RandomSorting`, `FavoriteCount`, or `SimilarityToSignalSorting`. If the sorting algorithm is not specified, the candidates are sorted based on the `FavoriteCount` algorithm. The method then removes duplicates and builds blended candidates using the `BlendedCandidatesBuilder` class.

The `removeDuplicates` method removes duplicates from a sequence of `InitialCandidate` objects based on their tweet IDs. The method uses a mutable set to keep track of the tweet IDs that have already been seen.

The `groupByEngineTypeOrFirstContribEngine` method groups a sequence of `InitialCandidate` objects based on their similarity engine type. If a candidate has multiple contributing similarity engines, the method uses the first one. The method returns a map where the keys are the similarity engine types and the values are sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects.

The `flattenAndGroupByEngineTypeOrFirstContribEngine` method flattens a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects and groups them based on their similarity engine type using the `groupByEngineTypeOrFirstContribEngine` method. The method returns a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects.

The `standardizeAndSortByScore` method standardizes the scores that come from the active similarity engine and then sorts the candidates based on the standardized scores. The method takes in a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects and returns a sequence of `InitialCandidate` objects. The method first calculates the mean and standard deviation of the scores for each group of candidates. It then standardizes the scores using the mean and standard deviation and sorts the candidates based on the standardized scores.

The `getSnowflakeTimeStamp` method returns the timestamp of a tweet based on its tweet ID. If the tweet ID is a Snowflake ID, the method uses the `SnowflakeId` class to extract the timestamp. Otherwise, the method returns a timestamp of 0.

Overall, the `ContentSignalBlender` class provides a flexible and extensible way to blend multiple types of sorting algorithms relying only on content-based signals. The class can be used in the larger project to generate blended candidates for various use cases, such as timeline ranking and search ranking.
