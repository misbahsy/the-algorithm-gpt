The FrsStoreModule code is a module that provides a ReadableStore for the Follow Recommendations Store (FrsStore) in the Twitter ecosystem. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to access the FrsStore, which is a source of recommendations for Twitter users to follow other users. 

The FrsStoreModule uses the Google Guice dependency injection framework to provide a singleton instance of the ReadableStore for the FrsStore. The ReadableStore is a generic interface that provides read-only access to a key-value store. In this case, the key is a FrsStore.Query object and the value is a sequence of FrsQueryResult objects. 

The FrsStoreModule provides the FrsStore with three dependencies: a FollowRecommendationsThriftService client, a StatsReceiver for collecting metrics, and a CrMixerDecider for deciding whether to use the FrsStore or another recommendation source. The FrsStore is created using these dependencies and wrapped in an ObservedReadableStore, which adds metrics collection to the ReadableStore. 

The FrsStoreModule is named using the ModuleNames.FrsStore constant, which is used to identify the FrsStore in other parts of the Twitter ecosystem. 

Example usage of the FrsStoreModule might look like this:

```
val injector = Guice.createInjector(FrsStoreModule)
val frsStore = injector.getInstance(Key.get(new TypeLiteral[ReadableStore[FrsStore.Query, Seq[FrsQueryResult]]](){}, Names.named(ModuleNames.FrsStore)))
val query = FrsStore.Query(userId)
val results = frsStore.get(query)
```

In this example, the FrsStoreModule is used to create a Guice injector, which is then used to get an instance of the FrsStore ReadableStore. A FrsStore.Query object is created with a user ID, and the ReadableStore is used to get a sequence of FrsQueryResult objects for that user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code provides a module for creating a `ReadableStore` that retrieves follow recommendations from a `FrsStore` using a `FollowRecommendationsThriftService`, with the ability to observe the store and track statistics.
2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on several other libraries and modules, including `com.google.inject`, `com.twitter.cr_mixer`, `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.inject`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.thriftscala`, and `com.twitter.hermit.store.common`.
3. What is the significance of the `@Provides`, `@Singleton`, and `@Named` annotations in this code?
   - The `@Provides` annotation indicates that the method provides a binding for a specific type, the `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the object will be created, and the `@Named` annotation provides a name for the binding to distinguish it from other bindings of the same type.
