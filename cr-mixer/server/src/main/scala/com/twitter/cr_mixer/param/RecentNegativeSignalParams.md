The code defines a set of parameters for the Recent Negative Signal feature in the Twitter Timeline service. The Recent Negative Signal feature is used to identify and filter out tweets that contain negative content, such as hate speech or harassment. The parameters are defined as a set of objects that extend the FSParam class, which is used to specify feature switch parameters. 

The EnableSourceParam object is defined to specify whether the Recent Negative Signal feature should be enabled or disabled. It is set to false by default, indicating that the feature is disabled. 

The AllParams object is defined to contain all the parameters for the Recent Negative Signal feature. Currently, it only contains the EnableSourceParam object. 

The config object is defined to build a BaseConfig object that contains the Recent Negative Signal parameters. It uses the FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil class to get any feature switch overrides for the parameters. The booleanOverrides variable is used to get any overrides for the EnableSourceParam parameter. The set() method is used to set the overrides for the BaseConfig object. 

Overall, this code is used to define and configure the parameters for the Recent Negative Signal feature in the Twitter Timeline service. It allows for the feature to be enabled or disabled based on the value of the EnableSourceParam parameter. The config object is used to build a BaseConfig object that contains the parameters for the feature, which can be used in the larger project to filter out negative tweets from user timelines. 

Example usage:

To enable the Recent Negative Signal feature, the EnableSourceParam parameter can be set to true:

```
RecentNegativeSignalParams.EnableSourceParam.set(true)
```

To get the BaseConfig object containing the Recent Negative Signal parameters:

```
val config = RecentNegativeSignalParams.config
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a set of parameters related to recent negative signals and builds a configuration object for them.
2. What is the significance of the `FSParam` and `FSName` classes?
   - `FSParam` and `FSName` are classes used to define feature switch parameters and their names, respectively. They are used to enable or disable certain features in the code.
3. What is the role of the `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` class?
   - The `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` class is used to get feature switch overrides for different types of parameters, such as boolean and enumerated types. It is used to customize the behavior of the code based on these overrides.
