The code defines a set of parameters for the ConsumersBasedUserVideoGraph algorithm in the Twitter project. The algorithm generates a graph of users who have interacted with video content on the platform. The parameters are used to tune the algorithm for different ways of generating the seed set of users for the graph. 

The `ConsumersBasedUserVideoGraphParams` object contains three parameter objects: `EnableSourceParam`, `RealGraphInMinCoOccurrenceParam`, and `RealGraphInMinScoreParam`. The first parameter is a boolean that enables the use of a source for the seed set. The other two parameters are used when generating the seed set using the RealGraphIn algorithm. `RealGraphInMinCoOccurrenceParam` is an integer that sets the minimum number of co-occurrences between users for them to be included in the seed set. `RealGraphInMinScoreParam` is a double that sets the minimum score for a user to be included in the seed set. 

The `AllParams` sequence contains all three parameter objects. The `config` value is a `BaseConfig` object that is lazily initialized. It uses the `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` to get any feature switch overrides for the three parameters and sets them in the `BaseConfigBuilder`. The `BaseConfig` object is then built and returned. 

This code allows for the tuning of the ConsumersBasedUserVideoGraph algorithm for different seed set generation methods. The parameters can be adjusted to optimize the algorithm for different use cases. For example, if the seed set is being generated using a different algorithm than RealGraphIn, the `RealGraphInMinCoOccurrenceParam` and `RealGraphInMinScoreParam` parameters would not be used. 

Example usage:
```
// Enable the use of a source for the seed set
ConsumersBasedUserVideoGraphParams.EnableSourceParam.enable()

// Set the minimum co-occurrence to 5
ConsumersBasedUserVideoGraphParams.RealGraphInMinCoOccurrenceParam.set(5)

// Get the current configuration
val config = ConsumersBasedUserVideoGraphParams.config
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines parameters for generating a consumer-based user video graph, with different algorithms for generating the consumer seed set.
2. What are the different parameters that can be tuned and what are their default values?
- The different parameters that can be tuned are `EnableSourceParam`, `RealGraphInMinCoOccurrenceParam`, and `RealGraphInMinScoreParam`. Their default values are `false`, `3`, and `2.0` respectively.
3. How are the parameter overrides set and used in this code?
- The parameter overrides are set using `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` and are used to build a `BaseConfig` object that can be used in the application.
