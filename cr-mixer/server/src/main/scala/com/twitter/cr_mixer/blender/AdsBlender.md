The `AdsBlender` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. The purpose of this class is to blend ads candidates for Twitter's ad serving system. The `blend` method takes a sequence of sequences of `InitialAdsCandidate` objects as input and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `BlendedAdsCandidate` objects. The `InitialAdsCandidate` objects represent the ads candidates that are generated for a tweet, and the `BlendedAdsCandidate` objects represent the blended ads candidates that are ready to be served for a tweet.

The blending process is done by interleaving the ads candidates in a specific order. The `InterestedIn` candidates, which have no source signal, are interleaved with the `TWISTLY` candidates, which have a source signal. The `TWISTLY` candidates are themselves interleaved by source before being blended with the `InterestedIn` candidates. The interleaving is done using the `InterleaveUtil` class. The resulting interleaved candidates are then used to build the blended ads candidates using the `buildBlendedAdsCandidate` method.

The `buildBlendedAdsCandidate` method takes the input candidates and the interleaved candidates as input and returns a sequence of `BlendedAdsCandidate` objects. It builds a lookup map from the tweet ID to the sequence of `CandidateGenerationInfo` objects. It then maps each interleaved candidate to a `BlendedAdsCandidate` object using the lookup map.

The `buildCandidateToCGInfosMap` method is a helper method that takes a sequence of sequences of `InitialAdsCandidate` objects as input and returns a map from the tweet ID to the sequence of `CandidateGenerationInfo` objects. It builds the map by iterating over the input candidates and adding the `CandidateGenerationInfo` objects to the map for each tweet ID.

Overall, the `AdsBlender` class provides a way to blend ads candidates for Twitter's ad serving system using a specific interleaving order. It is a key component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. An example usage of this class would be to call the `blend` method with a sequence of sequences of `InitialAdsCandidate` objects and then use the resulting sequence of `BlendedAdsCandidate` objects to serve ads for a tweet.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the AdsBlender class?
- The AdsBlender class is responsible for blending ads candidates by iteratively choosing InterestedIn candidates and TWISTLY candidates in turn.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has external dependencies on several packages and libraries, including com.twitter.cr_mixer, com.twitter.finagle.stats, com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common, com.twitter.util, javax.inject, and scala.collection.mutable.

3. What is the expected input and output of the blend method?
- The blend method expects a sequence of sequences of InitialAdsCandidate objects as input and returns a Future containing a sequence of BlendedAdsCandidate objects as output.
