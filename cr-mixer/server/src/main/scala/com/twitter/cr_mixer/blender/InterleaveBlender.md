The InterleaveBlender class is a part of the The Algorithm from Twitter project and is responsible for blending multiple sequences of InitialCandidate objects into a single sequence of BlendedCandidate objects. This class is implemented as a Singleton and is injected with a StatsReceiver object to track statistics related to the blending process.

The blend method takes a sequence of sequences of InitialCandidate objects as input and returns a Future object containing a sequence of BlendedCandidate objects. The blending process involves interleaving the input sequences by taking one candidate from each sequence in sequence until all candidates have been used. The resulting interleaved sequence is then used to build the blended sequence of candidates using the BlendedCandidatesBuilder class.

The InterleaveBlender class relies on the InterleaveUtil and BlendedCandidatesBuilder classes to perform the interleaving and blending operations, respectively. The StatsReceiver object is used to track the number of candidates processed during the blending process.

Here is an example of how the InterleaveBlender class can be used:

```
val blender = InterleaveBlender(statsReceiver)
val inputCandidates = Seq(Seq(candidate1, candidate2), Seq(candidate3, candidate4))
val blendedCandidatesFuture = blender.blend(inputCandidates)
blendedCandidatesFuture.onSuccess { blendedCandidates =>
  // use blendedCandidates sequence
}
```

In this example, a new InterleaveBlender object is created with a StatsReceiver object. The inputCandidates sequence contains two sequences of InitialCandidate objects. The blend method is called with the inputCandidates sequence, which returns a Future object containing the blended sequence of candidates. The onSuccess method is used to handle the successful completion of the Future object and to access the blendedCandidates sequence.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   - This code is a part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and it defines a class called InterleaveBlender that interleaves candidates from multiple sequences of InitialCandidate objects to create a sequence of BlendedCandidate objects. The purpose of this code is to blend multiple candidates into a single sequence for further processing.
   
2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
   - This code has dependencies on several other classes and libraries such as BlendedCandidate, InitialCandidate, InterleaveUtil, StatsReceiver, and Future. These dependencies are used to define the input and output types of the blend method, to perform interleaving of candidates, to collect statistics, and to return a Future object containing the blended candidates.

3. How is the blending of candidates implemented and what is the expected output?
   - The blending of candidates is implemented by first interleaving the input sequences of InitialCandidate objects using the InterleaveUtil.interleave method. Then, the blended candidates are constructed using the BlendedCandidatesBuilder.build method, which takes the input sequences and the interleaved candidates as arguments. The expected output of the blend method is a Future object containing a sequence of BlendedCandidate objects.
