[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/cr-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/cr_mixer/module/thrift_client/UserVideoGraphClientModule.scala)

The code defines a module for a Thrift client that communicates with a service called UserVideoGraph. The module is designed to be used in a larger project that requires communication with this service. 

The module extends the ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule, which provides a convenient way to build Thrift clients. It also extends the MtlsClient trait, which adds support for mutual TLS authentication. 

The UserVideoGraphClientModule defines a label and a destination for the client. The label is a string that identifies the client, and the destination is the address of the service that the client will communicate with. 

The module also defines a flag called userVideoGraphClientTimeout, which specifies the timeout for requests made by the client. The requestTimeout method returns the value of this flag. 

The module overrides the retryBudget method to return an empty RetryBudget. This means that the client will not retry failed requests. 

The configureThriftMuxClient method is also overridden to add some additional configuration to the ThriftMux client. It adds a StatsReceiver to collect metrics about the client's performance, and it sets a custom response classifier that ignores requests that were discarded by the server. 

Overall, this code defines a module that can be used to create a Thrift client for the UserVideoGraph service. The module provides some convenient defaults for configuring the client, and it can be customized further if needed. Here is an example of how this module might be used to create a client:

```
val injector = Injector()
val client = injector.instance[UserVideoGraph.Client]
val result = client.someMethod()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a Thrift client that connects to a service called UserVideoGraph. It sets up configuration for the client, including timeouts and retry budgets, and also handles discarded requests.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other libraries, including com.twitter.app, com.twitter.finagle, com.twitter.finatra.mtls, and com.twitter.inject.

3. What is the significance of the MtlsClient trait being extended by this object?
- The MtlsClient trait provides configuration for mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security) for the Thrift client. By extending this trait, the UserVideoGraphClientModule is able to use mutual TLS for secure communication with the UserVideoGraph service.
