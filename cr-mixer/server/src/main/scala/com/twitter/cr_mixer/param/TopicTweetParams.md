[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/cr-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/cr_mixer/param/TopicTweetParams.scala)

The code defines a set of parameters for generating topic-related tweets. The parameters are defined as objects and are grouped under the `TopicTweetParams` object. The parameters include the maximum age of tweets to consider, the maximum number of candidates to generate, and the maximum number of candidates for different types of tweet generation. The code also defines a semantic core version ID parameter. 

The `FSBoundedParam` class is used to define the parameters that have a minimum and maximum value. The `FSParam` class is used to define parameters that do not have a minimum or maximum value. The `HasDurationConversion` trait is used to define the duration conversion for the `MaxTweetAge` parameter. 

The `AllParams` sequence contains all the defined parameters. The `config` object is lazily initialized and contains the configuration for the parameters. The configuration is built using the `BaseConfigBuilder` class and sets the overrides for the parameters. The overrides are obtained using the `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` class, which provides methods to get the overrides for different types of parameters. 

This code can be used to configure the parameters for generating topic-related tweets in the larger project. The parameters can be accessed and modified as needed. For example, to get the value of the `MaxTweetAge` parameter, the following code can be used:

```
val maxTweetAge = TopicTweetParams.MaxTweetAge()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a set of parameters related to generating topic-related tweets and provides default values and bounds for each parameter. It also creates a configuration object that can be used to override these default values.

2. What are the different parameters being defined and what are their default values and bounds?
- The different parameters being defined include MaxTweetAge, MaxTopicTweetCandidatesParam, MaxSkitTfgCandidatesParam, MaxSkitHighPrecisionCandidatesParam, MaxCertoCandidatesParam, CertoScoreThresholdParam, and SemanticCoreVersionIdParam. Their default values and bounds are specified in the code.

3. How are the default values and bounds of these parameters used in the configuration object?
- The default values and bounds of these parameters are used to create a BaseConfig object that can be used to override these values. The configuration object is created by setting various FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil methods with the default values and bounds of the parameters.
