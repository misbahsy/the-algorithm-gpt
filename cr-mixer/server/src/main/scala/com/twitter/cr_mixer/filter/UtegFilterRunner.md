The `UtegFilterRunner` class is a filter runner for the UTEG (User Timeline Expansion Generator) candidate generator. It runs a sequence of filters sequentially on a set of candidate tweets to generate a new set of filtered candidate tweets. The class takes in three filters as dependencies: `InNetworkFilter`, `UtegHealthFilter`, and `RetweetFilter`. It also takes in a `StatsReceiver` object for recording statistics.

The `runSequentialFilters` method takes in two parameters: a `CandidateGeneratorQuery` object and a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects. The method returns a `Future` of a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects. The method calls a private method `runSequentialFilters` in the companion object with the same parameters and additional parameters: the ordered filters and a `StatsReceiver` object. The method returns the result of calling `runSequentialFilters` on the companion object.

The companion object contains two private methods: `recordCandidateStatsBeforeFilter` and `recordCandidateStatsAfterFilter`. These methods record statistics on the number of empty sources and the number of candidates before and after filtering. The `runSequentialFilters` method takes in a sequence of filters, a `StatsReceiver` object, and the same parameters as the method in the class. The method uses `foldLeft` to apply each filter in sequence to the candidates. For each filter, it records the candidate statistics before and after filtering using the private methods. It then applies the filter to the candidates and returns the filtered candidates in a `Future`. The method returns the final filtered candidates.

This class is used in the larger project to filter candidate tweets for the UTEG candidate generator. It provides a way to run a sequence of filters on a set of candidate tweets and generate a new set of filtered candidate tweets. The statistics recorded by the class can be used to monitor the performance of the filters and the quality of the candidate tweets. An example of using this class would be:

```
val filterRunner = new UtegFilterRunner(inNetworkFilter, utegHealthFilter, retweetFilter, statsReceiver)
val filteredCandidates = filterRunner.runSequentialFilters(query, candidates).await()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code runs filters sequentially for UTEG candidate generator, and it helps to filter out unwanted candidates based on certain criteria.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `CandidateGeneratorQuery`, `InitialCandidate`, `StatsReceiver`, `Future`, `InNetworkFilter`, `UtegHealthFilter`, and `RetweetFilter`.

3. What is the significance of the `recordCandidateStatsBeforeFilter` and `recordCandidateStatsAfterFilter` functions?
- These functions are helper functions that record statistics about the candidates before and after they are filtered by the sequential filters. They help to keep track of the number of empty sources and the number of candidates before and after filtering.
