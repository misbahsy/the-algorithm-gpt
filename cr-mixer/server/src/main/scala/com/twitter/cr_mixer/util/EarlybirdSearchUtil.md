The `EarlybirdSearchUtil` object contains utility functions for creating and manipulating Earlybird queries, which are used for searching Twitter data. The `EarlybirdSearchUtil` object contains several constants and functions that can be used to create Earlybird queries. 

The `EarlybirdClientId` constant is a string that represents the client ID for the Earlybird search. The `Mentions` and `Hashtags` constants are strings that represent the Earlybird field constants for mentions and hashtags, respectively. The `FacetsToFetch` constant is a sequence of strings that contains the field constants for mentions and hashtags. The `MetadataOptions` constant is a ThriftSearchResultMetadataOptions object that contains options for retrieving metadata about search results. The `TweetTypesToExclude` constant is a sequence of strings that contains the tweet types to exclude from search results.

The `GetCollectorTerminationParams` function returns a CollectorTerminationParams object that contains parameters for early termination of the search collector. The `GetEarlybirdQuery` function returns an Earlybird query based on the search input. The `CreateRangeQuery` function creates a range query based on the before and after tweet IDs. The `CreateTweetTypesFilters` function creates tweet type filters based on the `TweetTypesToExclude` constant. The `CreateConjunction` function creates a conjunction of Earlybird queries. The `CreateExcludedTweetIdsQuery` function creates an Earlybird query that excludes tweet IDs. The `GetNamedDisjunctions` function returns a map of named disjunctions with excluded tweet IDs.

Overall, the `EarlybirdSearchUtil` object provides a set of utility functions for creating and manipulating Earlybird queries, which can be used for searching Twitter data. These functions can be used in the larger project to facilitate searching and filtering of Twitter data. 

Example usage:

```
val query = EarlybirdSearchUtil.GetEarlybirdQuery(
  beforeTweetIdExclusive = Some(123456789),
  afterTweetIdExclusive = None,
  excludedTweetIds = Set(987654321),
  filterOutRetweetsAndReplies = true
)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code provides utility functions for working with Earlybird queries in the context of Twitter search. It includes functions for creating Earlybird queries based on search input, filtering out retweets and replies, and creating named disjunctions with excluded tweet IDs.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several classes from external dependencies, including `EarlybirdFieldConstants` and `ThriftSearchResultMetadataOptions` from the `com.twitter.search.common.schema.earlybird` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thriftscala` packages, respectively.

3. What is the significance of the `EarlybirdClientId` variable?
- The `EarlybirdClientId` variable is a string that identifies the client using Earlybird to perform the search. In this case, it is set to "cr-mixer.prod".
