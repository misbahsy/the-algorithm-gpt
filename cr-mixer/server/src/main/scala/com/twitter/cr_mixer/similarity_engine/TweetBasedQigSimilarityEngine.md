The `TweetBasedQigSimilarityEngine` is a Scala class that implements a `ReadableStore` interface. It is used to find similar tweets from QueryInteractionGraph (QIG) for a given source tweet ID. QIG returns similar tweets that have an overlap of engagements with the query tweet on different search queries. 

The class takes two parameters: `qigRanker` and `statsReceiver`. `qigRanker` is an instance of `QigRanker.MethodPerEndpoint`, which is a Thrift client for QigRanker. `statsReceiver` is an instance of `StatsReceiver`, which is used to track statistics for the class. 

The class has a single method `get`, which takes a `Query` object and returns a `Future` of an optional sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects. The `Query` object contains a `sourceId` field, which is an instance of `InternalId`. If the `sourceId` is a tweet ID, the method calls `getQigSimilarTweetsRequest` to get a QigRanker request for the tweet ID. It then calls `getSimilarCandidates` on the `qigRanker` object to get similar tweets from QIG. Finally, it calls `getCandidatesFromQigResponse` to extract the tweets with scores from the QigRanker response. If the `sourceId` is not a tweet ID, the method returns a `Future` with a value of `None`. 

The `getQigSimilarTweetsRequest` method takes a tweet ID and returns a `QigRankerRequest` object. It creates a `ClientContext` object with a dummy user ID and a `ProductContext` object with a `TwistlySimilarTweetsProductContext` object that contains the tweet ID. It then returns a `QigRankerRequest` object with the `clientContext`, `Product.TwistlySimilarTweets`, and `productContext` fields set. 

The `getCandidatesFromQigResponse` method takes a `QigRankerResponse` object and returns an optional sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects. It extracts the `similarTweets` field from the `TwistlySimilarTweetCandidatesResponse` object in the `productResponse` field of the `QigRankerProductResponse` object. It then maps the `similarTweetResult` objects to `TweetWithScore` objects and returns them in an optional sequence. 

The `TweetBasedQigSimilarityEngine` object contains a `toSimilarityEngineInfo` method, which takes a score and returns a `SimilarityEngineInfo` object. The `SimilarityEngineInfo` object contains information about the similarity engine, including the type of engine, the model ID, and the score. 

The `TweetBasedQigSimilarityEngine` object also contains a `Query` case class, which contains a single field `sourceId` of type `InternalId`. It also contains a `fromParams` method, which takes an `InternalId` object and a `configapi.Params` object and returns an `EngineQuery` object. The `EngineQuery` object contains a `Query` object and a `Params` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code implements a store that retrieves similar tweets from a QueryInteractionGraph (QIG) for a given tweet ID. It solves the problem of finding tweets that have an overlap of engagements with the query tweet on different search queries.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and libraries, including com.twitter.cr_mixer, com.twitter.finagle, com.twitter.frigate, com.twitter.product_mixer, com.twitter.qig_ranker, com.twitter.simclusters_v2, com.twitter.storehaus, com.twitter.timelines, com.twitter.util, and javax.inject.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a Future that returns an optional sequence of TweetWithScore objects, which contain information about similar tweets and their scores. If the source ID is not a tweet ID, the Future returns None.
