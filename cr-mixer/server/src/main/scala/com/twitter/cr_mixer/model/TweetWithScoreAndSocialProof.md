The `TweetWithScoreAndSocialProof` class is a data model used to bind a tweet ID with a raw score and social proofs by type. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. 

The class has three properties: `tweetId`, `score`, and `socialProofByType`. The `tweetId` property is of type `TweetId`, which is imported from the `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common` package. The `score` property is of type `Double` and represents the raw score associated with the tweet. The `socialProofByType` property is a `Map` that associates a `SocialProofType` with a sequence of `Long` values. The `SocialProofType` is imported from the `com.twitter.recos.recos_common.thriftscala` package.

This class can be used to represent a tweet along with its score and social proofs. The `TweetWithScoreAndSocialProof` object can be created by passing in the tweet ID, score, and social proofs as arguments. For example:

```
val tweetId = TweetId(1234567890L)
val score = 0.8
val socialProofByType = Map(SocialProofType.FOLLOWER_COUNT -> Seq(1000L, 2000L, 3000L))
val tweetWithScoreAndSocialProof = TweetWithScoreAndSocialProof(tweetId, score, socialProofByType)
```

In this example, a `TweetId` object is created with a value of `1234567890L`. The `score` is set to `0.8`, and the `socialProofByType` is a `Map` that associates the `FOLLOWER_COUNT` `SocialProofType` with a sequence of `Long` values. Finally, a `TweetWithScoreAndSocialProof` object is created by passing in these values as arguments.

Overall, the `TweetWithScoreAndSocialProof` class is a useful data model for representing tweets along with their scores and social proofs in The Algorithm from Twitter project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a case class called `TweetWithScoreAndSocialProof` that binds a tweet ID with a score and social proofs by type.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on two external libraries: `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common.TweetId` and `com.twitter.recos.recos_common.thriftscala.SocialProofType`.

3. How is the social proof data structured in this code?
- The social proof data is stored as a map where the keys are `SocialProofType` and the values are sequences of `Long` integers.
