The `SwitchBlender` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for blending multiple sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects into a single sequence of `BlendedCandidate` objects. The blending algorithm used is determined by the `BlenderParams.BlendingAlgorithmParam` parameter passed to the `blend` method. The available blending algorithms are `RoundRobin`, `SourceTypeBackFill`, `SourceSignalSorting`, and a default algorithm that uses the `InterleaveBlender` class.

The `blend` method takes in a `Params` object, a `UserState` object, and a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects. It first removes any empty sequences from the input and then sorts the non-empty sequences based on the `BlenderParams.SignalTypeSortingAlgorithmParam` parameter passed in the `Params` object. The available sorting algorithms are `SourceSignalRecency` and `RandomSorting`. If `SourceSignalRecency` is selected, the sequences are sorted in descending order based on the timestamp of the source signal associated with the first `InitialCandidate` object in each sequence. If `RandomSorting` is selected, the sequences are sorted randomly.

Once the sequences are sorted, the `blend` method calls the appropriate blending algorithm based on the `BlenderParams.BlendingAlgorithmParam` parameter. If `RoundRobin` is selected, the `defaultBlender` object of type `InterleaveBlender` is used to blend the sequences. If `SourceTypeBackFill` is selected, the `sourceTypeBackFillBlender` object of type `SourceTypeBackFillBlender` is used. If `SourceSignalSorting` is selected, the `contentSignalBlender` object of type `ContentSignalBlender` is used. If none of the available blending algorithms are selected, the `defaultBlender` object is used.

The `SwitchBlender` class is a singleton and is injected with the necessary blending objects and a `StatsReceiver` object for monitoring. The `TimestampOrder` and `RandomOrder` objects are used as ordering functions for sorting the sequences based on the `BlenderParams.SignalTypeSortingAlgorithmParam` parameter. The `TimestampOrder` object sorts the sequences based on the timestamp of the source signal associated with the first `InitialCandidate` object in each sequence in descending order. The `RandomOrder` object sorts the sequences randomly.

Example usage:
```
val switchBlender = SwitchBlender(defaultBlender, sourceTypeBackFillBlender, adsBlender, contentSignalBlender, statsReceiver)
val params = Params()
val userState = UserState()
val inputCandidates = Seq(Seq(initialCandidate1, initialCandidate2), Seq(initialCandidate3, initialCandidate4))
val blendedCandidates = switchBlender.blend(params, userState, inputCandidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and it provides a SwitchBlender class that blends a sequence of initial candidates based on specified blender rules.
2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including UserState, BlendedCandidate, InitialCandidate, BlenderParams, StatsReceiver, Future, Time, and several other blender classes.
3. What is the logic behind the sorting of candidates in the blend method?
- The sorting of candidates is based on the value of the BlenderParams.SignalTypeSortingAlgorithmParam parameter, which can be set to either BlenderParams.ContentBasedSortingAlgorithmEnum.SourceSignalRecency or BlenderParams.ContentBasedSortingAlgorithmEnum.RandomSorting. If it is set to SourceSignalRecency, candidates are sorted in descending order based on the timestamp of their source signal. If it is set to RandomSorting, candidates are sorted randomly.
