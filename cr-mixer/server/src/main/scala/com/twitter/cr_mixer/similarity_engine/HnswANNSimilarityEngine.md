The `HnswANNSimilarityEngine` class is a similarity engine that looks for tweets whose similarity is close to a source dense embedding. It provides HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) specific implementations. The class takes in an `embeddingStoreLookUpMap` and an `annServiceLookUpMap` as parameters. The `embeddingStoreLookUpMap` is a map of model IDs to `ReadableStore` objects that contain the embeddings for each model. The `annServiceLookUpMap` is a map of model IDs to `AnnQueryService.MethodPerEndpoint` objects that contain the ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) index for each model. 

The `HnswANNSimilarityEngine` class has a method called `getCandidates` that takes in an `HnswANNEngineQuery` object and returns a `Future` of an optional sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects. The `HnswANNEngineQuery` object contains the model ID, source ID, and parameters for the query. The `TweetWithScore` object contains the tweet ID and a score that represents the similarity between the tweet and the source embedding. 

The `getCandidates` method first checks if the query is cacheable. If it is, it wraps the underlying store with a MemCache layer. Then, it calls the `SimilarityEngine.getFromFn` method to get the candidates for the query. The `SimilarityEngine.getFromFn` method takes in the store, query, engine configuration, query parameters, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It returns a `Future` of an optional sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects. 

The `HnswANNSimilarityEngine` class also has a method called `toScore` that takes in a `Distance` object and returns a score that represents the similarity between two embeddings. The `Distance` object can be one of four types: `EditDistance`, `L2Distance`, `CosineDistance`, or `InnerProductDistance`. The `toScore` method converts the distance to a score such that higher scores mean more similarity. 

Overall, the `HnswANNSimilarityEngine` class is an implementation of a similarity engine that uses HNSW and ANN to find tweets that are similar to a source embedding. It takes in a map of model IDs to stores and a map of model IDs to ANN indexes. It returns a sequence of tweets with scores that represent their similarity to the source embedding.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code implements a similarity engine that looks for tweets whose similarity is close to a source dense embedding. It provides HNSW specific implementations and supports Long based embedding lookup.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has external dependencies on several libraries, including com.twitter.ann.common.thriftscala, com.twitter.ann.hnsw, com.twitter.bijection, com.twitter.cortex.ml.embeddings.common, com.twitter.ml.api.thriftscala, com.twitter.ml.featurestore.lib, com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala, com.twitter.storehaus, and com.twitter.timelines.configapi.

3. What is the purpose of the MemCacheConfig parameter and when should it be enabled?
- The MemCacheConfig parameter is used to wrap the underlying store with a MemCache layer. It should only be enabled for cacheable queries, such as TweetIds, and not for consumer-based UserIds, which are generally not possible to cache.
