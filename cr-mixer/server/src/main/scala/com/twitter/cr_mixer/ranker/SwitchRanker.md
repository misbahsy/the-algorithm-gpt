The SwitchRanker class is a component of the CR-Mixer internal ranker system used by Twitter. It takes in a CrCandidateGeneratorQuery and a sequence of BlendedCandidate objects and returns a Future containing a sequence of RankedCandidate objects. The rank method simply calls the rank method of the defaultRanker object, which is an instance of the DefaultRanker class.

The purpose of the SwitchRanker class is to provide a way to switch between different rankers in the CR-Mixer system. The defaultRanker object is injected into the SwitchRanker constructor, so it can be easily swapped out for a different ranker implementation if needed.

The TimestampOrder object is a companion object to the SwitchRanker class that defines an Ordering for RankedCandidate objects. This Ordering is used to sort the candidates based on the timestamp of the source event that generated them. Candidates generated from sources with more recent timestamps are ranked higher than candidates generated from older sources. This ordering biases against consumer-based candidates because their timestamp defaults to 0.

Here is an example of how the SwitchRanker class might be used in the larger CR-Mixer system:

```scala
val query = CrCandidateGeneratorQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(BlendedCandidate(...), BlendedCandidate(...), ...)
val ranker = new SwitchRanker(defaultRanker, statsReceiver)
val rankedCandidatesFuture = ranker.rank(query, candidates)
rankedCandidatesFuture.onSuccess { rankedCandidates =>
  // do something with the ranked candidates
}
``` 

In this example, a CrCandidateGeneratorQuery object and a sequence of BlendedCandidate objects are created. A new instance of the SwitchRanker class is created with a defaultRanker object and a statsReceiver object. The rank method of the SwitchRanker object is called with the query and candidates, which returns a Future containing a sequence of RankedCandidate objects. The onSuccess method is called on the Future to handle the successful completion of the ranking process. The rankedCandidates sequence can then be used for further processing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a ranker for the CR-Mixer project at Twitter, which ranks blended candidates based on their source signal timestamps. It solves the problem of determining the most relevant candidate based on the recency of its source signal.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including `BlendedCandidate`, `CrCandidateGeneratorQuery`, `RankedCandidate`, `StatsReceiver`, `Future`, `JavaTimer`, `Time`, `Timer`, `Inject`, and `Singleton`.

3. How does the `TimestampOrder` object work and what is its purpose?
- The `TimestampOrder` object defines an ordering for `RankedCandidate` objects based on the timestamp of their source signal. Candidates with a more recent timestamp are ranked higher. Its purpose is to bias the ranking towards candidates with more recent source signals and against consumer-based candidates with a default timestamp of 0.
