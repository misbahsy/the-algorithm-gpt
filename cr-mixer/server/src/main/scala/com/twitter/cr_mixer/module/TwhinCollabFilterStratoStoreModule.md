The `TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreModule` file is a module that provides four different `ReadableStore` instances for accessing tweet IDs stored in Strato, a distributed key-value store. These stores are used in the larger project to power the TwhinCollabFilterSimilarityEngine, which is a similarity engine that recommends tweets to users based on their engagement history and the engagement history of users similar to them.

The module provides four different stores, each with a different view of the same column in Strato. The column path is defined as `cuad/twhin/getCollabFilterTweetCandidatesProd.User`. The four stores are:

- `TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreForFollow`: This store provides tweet IDs for users that the current user follows. The view used is `follow_2022_03_10_c_500K`.
- `TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreForEngagement`: This store provides tweet IDs for users that the current user has engaged with. The view used is `engagement_2022_04_10_c_500K`.
- `TwhinMultiClusterStratoStoreForFollow`: This store provides tweet IDs for users that the current user follows, across multiple clusters. The view used is `multiclusterFollow20220921`.
- `TwhinMultiClusterStratoStoreForEngagement`: This store provides tweet IDs for users that the current user has engaged with, across multiple clusters. The view used is `multiclusterEng20220921`.

Each store is created using the `StratoFetchableStore.withView` method, which takes a `StratoClient`, a column path, and a view as arguments. The view is an instance of the `TwhinCollabFilterView` class, which is a case class that takes a string argument representing the name of the view.

Here is an example of how one of these stores might be used:

```scala
import com.twitter.cr_mixer.module.TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreModule
import com.twitter.inject.Injector
import com.twitter.inject.app.TestInjector

// Create a test injector
val injector: Injector = TestInjector(TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreModule)

// Get the store for users that the current user follows
val store = injector.instance[ReadableStore[Long, Seq[TweetId]]](
  "TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreForFollow"
)

// Get the tweet IDs for the user with ID 12345
val tweetIds = store.get(12345L)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides Guice bindings for StratoFetchableStore with views for different types of TwhinCollabFilterStratoStores, which are ReadableStores of Long and Seq[TweetId]. It solves the problem of efficiently fetching tweet candidates for collaborative filtering.

2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?
- This code requires dependencies from com.google.inject, com.twitter.inject, com.twitter.cr_mixer, com.twitter.frigate, com.twitter.strato, and com.twitter.simclusters_v2 packages.

3. What are the different types of TwhinCollabFilterStratoStores provided by this code and how do they differ?
- This code provides four different types of TwhinCollabFilterStratoStores: TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreForFollow, TwhinCollabFilterStratoStoreForEngagement, TwhinMultiClusterStratoStoreForFollow, and TwhinMultiClusterStratoStoreForEngagement. They differ in the view they use to fetch tweet candidates and the Strato column path they access.
