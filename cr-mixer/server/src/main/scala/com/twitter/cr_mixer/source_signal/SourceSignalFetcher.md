[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/misbahsy/the-algorithm/cr-mixer/server/src/main/scala/com/twitter/cr_mixer/source_signal/SourceSignalFetcher.scala)

The code defines a trait called `SourceSignalFetcher` that extends from `SourceFetcher` and is specialized in fetching signals related to user engagements. Signals are defined as a set of past engagements that the user makes, such as RecentFav, RecentFollow, etc. The `ResultType` of a `SourceSignalFetcher` is `Seq[SourceInfo]`. When a `userId` is passed in, the underlying store returns a list of signals.

The trait defines a method called `trackStats` that takes in a `FetcherQuery` and a function that returns a `Future` of `Option[Seq[SourceInfo]]`. The method tracks statistics related to the query and user state and returns the result of the function.

The trait also defines a method called `convertSourceInfo` that takes in a `SourceType` and a sequence of signals of type `SignalConvertType`. The method converts the signals into `SourceInfo`.

This code is likely used in a larger project that involves analyzing user engagements on Twitter. The `SourceSignalFetcher` trait is likely used to fetch and analyze signals related to user engagements, such as recent favorites and follows. The `convertSourceInfo` method is likely used to convert the signals into a format that can be more easily analyzed. The `trackStats` method is likely used to track statistics related to the queries and user states to help with analysis and optimization. Overall, this code is an important component of a larger system for analyzing user engagements on Twitter.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a trait called `SourceSignalFetcher` that extends from `SourceFetcher` and is specialized in fetching signals related to user engagements. It solves the problem of retrieving past user engagements from an underlying store.

2. What is the `ResultType` of a `SourceSignalFetcher` and what does it represent?
- The `ResultType` of a `SourceSignalFetcher` is `Seq[SourceInfo]`, which represents a list of source information related to user engagements.

3. What is the purpose of the `trackStats` method and how is it used?
- The `trackStats` method is used to track statistics related to fetching source information for a given query. It takes a `FetcherQuery` object and a function that returns a `Future` of optional `Seq[SourceInfo]`, and returns a `Future` of optional `Seq[SourceInfo]` while tracking statistics related to the query and user state. It is used to monitor and optimize the performance of the source signal fetching process.
