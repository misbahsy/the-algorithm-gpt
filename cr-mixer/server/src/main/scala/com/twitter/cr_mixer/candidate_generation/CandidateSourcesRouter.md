The `CandidateSourcesRouter` class in this code is responsible for routing the `SourceInfo` to the associated Candidate Engines. It fetches candidates from various similarity engines and filters them based on certain conditions. The main function of this class is `fetchCandidates`, which takes a user ID, source signals, source graphs, and parameters as input and returns a future sequence of initial candidates.

The `fetchCandidates` function fetches candidates from different similarity engines such as `tweetBasedUnifiedSimilarityEngine`, `producerBasedUnifiedSimilarityEngine`, `consumerEmbeddingBasedTripSimilarityEngine`, `consumerBasedTwHINANNSimilarityEngine`, `consumerBasedTwoTowerSimilarityEngine`, and others. It then filters the candidates based on age, score, and other conditions. The function also limits the number of candidates per source using the `MaxCandidateNumPerSourceKeyParam` parameter.

For example, the `getConsumerBasedWalsCandidates` function fetches candidates from the `consumerBasedWalsSimilarityEngine` and filters them based on tweet age and source signal age. Similarly, the `getSimClustersTripCandidates` function fetches candidates from the `consumerEmbeddingBasedTripSimilarityEngine` and filters them based on certain conditions.

The `convertToInitialCandidates` function is used to convert the fetched candidates into `InitialCandidate` objects, which contain the tweet ID, tweet info, and candidate generation info. This function is used in various places within the `fetchCandidates` function to convert the candidates fetched from different similarity engines.

In summary, the `CandidateSourcesRouter` class is responsible for fetching and filtering candidates from various similarity engines and returning a sequence of initial candidates that can be used in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CandidateSourcesRouter` class and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `CandidateSourcesRouter` class is responsible for routing the `SourceInfo` to the associated Candidate Engines. It fetches candidates from different similarity engines and filters them based on various conditions. The main method `fetchCandidates` takes in a user ID, source signals, source graphs, and parameters, and returns a Future of a sequence of initial candidates.

2. **Question**: What are the different types of source signals and how are they used in the code?
   **Answer**: There are several types of source signals, such as TweetFavorite, Retweet, OriginalTweet, Reply, TweetShare, etc. These source signals are used to filter and fetch candidates from different similarity engines like TweetBasedUnifiedSimilarityEngine, ProducerBasedUnifiedSimilarityEngine, and ConsumerBasedWalsSimilarityEngine.

3. **Question**: How are the candidates filtered and sorted before being returned by the `fetchCandidates` method?
   **Answer**: The candidates are filtered based on their age, source signal age, and other conditions specific to each similarity engine. They are then sorted by their score in descending order. The final result is a sequence of initial candidates after applying all the filters and sorting.
