The `SignalTimestampStatsUtil` class is responsible for generating statistics related to the signal timestamp of a tweet recommendation. The signal timestamp is the time at which a tweet was favorited or retweeted, and it is used as a signal to determine the relevance of a tweet recommendation. The purpose of this class is to count the number of tweet recommendations that have a signal timestamp within a certain time frame, and to generate statistics based on this count.

The class takes in a `StatsReceiver` object as an argument, which is used to record the statistics. It is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire application.

The class has three private variables, `signalDelayAgePerDayStats`, `signalDelayAgePerHourStats`, and `signalDelayAgePerMinStats`, which are all instances of the `BucketTimestampStats` class. Each of these variables is responsible for counting the number of tweet recommendations that have a signal timestamp within a certain time frame. The `BucketTimestampStats` class is a generic class that takes in a type parameter, which in this case is `TweetRecommendation`. It also takes in three arguments: the time interval for each bucket, a function that extracts the signal timestamp from a `TweetRecommendation` object, and an optional maximum time interval. The `scope` method is called on the `statsReceiver` object to create a new scope for each of the three variables.

The `statsSignalTimestamp` method takes in a sequence of `TweetRecommendation` objects and counts the number of tweet recommendations that have a signal timestamp within the time frames specified by the three private variables. It does this by calling the `count` method on each of the three private variables.

The `SignalTimestampStatsUtil` object contains three constants, `SignalTimestampMaxMins`, `SignalTimestampMaxHours`, and `SignalTimestampMaxDays`, which specify the maximum time intervals for each of the three private variables. It also contains a `buildLatestSourceSignalTimestamp` method, which takes in a `RankedCandidate` object and returns the latest signal timestamp for that candidate. It does this by extracting the signal timestamps from the potential reasons for the candidate and returning the maximum value. If there are no signal timestamps, it returns `None`.

Overall, the `SignalTimestampStatsUtil` class is an important component of the larger project, as it provides valuable statistics related to the signal timestamp of tweet recommendations. These statistics can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation algorithm and to identify areas for improvement. An example of how this class might be used in the larger project is to generate a report that shows the percentage of tweet recommendations that have a signal timestamp within the past 24 hours, past 7 days, and past 30 days. This report could be used to identify trends in the signal timestamp data and to make adjustments to the recommendation algorithm as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a utility class called `SignalTimestampStatsUtil` that provides methods for computing statistics related to the timestamp of a signal in a `TweetRecommendation` object.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including `com.twitter.cr_mixer`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats`, and `com.twitter.relevance_platform.common.stats`.

3. What is the significance of the `SignalTimestampMaxMins`, `SignalTimestampMaxHours`, and `SignalTimestampMaxDays` constants?
- These constants define the maximum time periods for which statistics will be computed by the `SignalTimestampStatsUtil` class, in minutes, hours, and days, respectively.
