The `TimeoutConfigModule` is a module that provides timeout configurations for various services in the CrMixer project. The purpose of this module is to provide a centralized location for configuring timeouts for different services. 

The module defines several flags for timeouts, such as `serviceTimeout`, `signalFetchTimeout`, `similarityEngineTimeout`, and `annServiceClientTimeout`. These flags are initialized with default values and can be overridden by command-line arguments or configuration files. 

The module also provides a `provideTimeoutBudget()` method that returns a `TimeoutConfig` object. This object contains the timeout values for all the flags defined in the module. The `TimeoutConfig` object is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of this object will be created and shared across the application. 

The `TimeoutConfig` object can be injected into other classes that need to set timeouts for different services. For example, a class that makes RPC calls to the `earlybird` service can inject the `TimeoutConfig` object and use the `earlybirdServerTimeout` flag to set the timeout for the RPC call. 

Overall, the `TimeoutConfigModule` provides a convenient way to manage timeouts for different services in the CrMixer project. By centralizing the timeout configurations in one module, it makes it easier to manage and modify timeouts across the project. 

Example usage:

```scala
class EarlybirdServiceClient @Inject()(
  timeoutConfig: TimeoutConfig
) {
  def getSomeData(): Future[Data] = {
    val timeout = timeoutConfig.earlybirdServerTimeout
    // make RPC call with timeout
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines timeout configurations for various services in CrMixer.

2. What are some examples of services that have timeout configurations defined in this code?
- Examples of services with timeout configurations defined in this code include Earlybird, FrsSignalFetch, QigRanker, Tweetypie, and Navi.

3. How are the timeout configurations used in this code?
- The timeout configurations are used to create a `TimeoutConfig` object that is provided as a singleton through the `provideTimeoutBudget()` method.
