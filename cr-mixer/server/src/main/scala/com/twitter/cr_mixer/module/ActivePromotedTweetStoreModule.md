The `ActivePromotedTweetStoreModule` is a Scala object that provides a Guice module for creating a `ReadableStore` of active promoted tweets. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to retrieve information about active promoted tweets, which are tweets that are being promoted by advertisers on Twitter. 

The `ActivePromotedTweetStore` case class is defined within the module and implements the `ReadableStore` trait. It takes two parameters: a `ReadableStore` of `DataRecord` objects and a `StatsReceiver`. The `get` method of the `ReadableStore` trait is implemented to retrieve the `DataRecord` for a given `TweetId` and convert it to a sequence of `LineItemInfo` objects. 

The `providesActivePromotedTweetStore` method is annotated with `@Provides` and `@Singleton` to indicate that it provides a singleton instance of the `ReadableStore`. It takes three parameters: a `ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams` object, a `MemcachedClient` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It creates a `ManhattanROConfig` object with the necessary configuration for accessing the Manhattan key-value store, and uses it to create a `ReadableStore` of `DataRecord` objects. It then creates an instance of the `ActivePromotedTweetStore` case class with the `ReadableStore` and `StatsReceiver` objects, and wraps it in an `ObservedMemcachedReadableStore` to provide caching. Finally, it wraps the `ObservedMemcachedReadableStore` in an `ObservedCachedReadableStore` to provide an in-memory cache.

This module can be used in the larger project to retrieve information about active promoted tweets. For example, it could be used by a service that provides analytics on promoted tweets to retrieve the line item IDs and objectives for a given tweet. Here is an example of how the `ActivePromotedTweetStore` could be used:

```
val tweetId: TweetId = ...
val store: ReadableStore[TweetId, Seq[LineItemInfo]] = ...
val lineItemInfoFuture: Future[Option[Seq[LineItemInfo]]] = store.get(tweetId)
lineItemInfoFuture.foreach { lineItemInfoOption =>
  lineItemInfoOption.foreach { lineItemInfo =>
    // Do something with the line item info
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve? 
- This code provides a module for creating a ReadableStore that retrieves active promoted tweets from a Manhattan key-value store and caches them in a Memcached client for faster access. It solves the problem of slow access to the Manhattan store by caching frequently accessed data.

2. What dependencies does this code have? 
- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Google Guice, Bijection, Finagle, Hermit, and Twitter Inject. It also depends on the ThriftScala library for working with Thrift objects.

3. What is the caching strategy used in this code? 
- This code uses a two-level caching strategy where data is first retrieved from a Manhattan key-value store and then cached in a Memcached client. The Memcached cache has a TTL of 60 minutes and the in-memory cache has a TTL of 30 minutes with a maximum of 250,000 keys and a window size of 10,000.
