The code defines a module for a Thrift client that communicates with a service called QigRanker. The QigRanker service is responsible for ranking search results based on their relevance to a given query. The module is designed to be used within a larger project that requires search functionality.

The module extends the ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule, which provides a convenient way to build Thrift clients using method builders. It also extends the MtlsClient trait, which adds support for mutual TLS authentication.

The QigServiceClientModule object defines a number of properties and methods that are used to configure the Thrift client. The label property is a string that identifies the client in logs and metrics. The dest property is the destination address of the QigRanker service.

The module also defines a flag called qigRankerClientTimeout, which specifies the timeout for requests to the QigRanker service. The requestTimeout method returns the value of this flag.

The configureThriftMuxClient method is used to configure the ThriftMux client that is used to communicate with the QigRanker service. It adds a StatsReceiver to the client, which is used to collect metrics about the client's performance. It also defines a response classifier that handles discarded requests by marking them as ignorable.

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to build a Thrift client for the QigRanker service that is configurable and supports mutual TLS authentication. It can be used in a larger project that requires search functionality by injecting the client into the appropriate components. For example, the client could be used by a search controller to retrieve search results from the QigRanker service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a module for a Thrift client that connects to a QigRanker service. It sets the label and destination for the client, as well as a timeout for requests, and configures the ThriftMux client with a stats receiver and response classifier.

2. What is the significance of the MtlsClient trait being extended by this module?
- The MtlsClient trait is used to enable mutual TLS authentication for the Thrift client. This means that both the client and server must present valid certificates to establish a secure connection.

3. What is the purpose of the flag defined in this module and how is it used?
- The qigRankerClientTimeout flag is used to set a timeout for requests made by the Thrift client. It is defined as a duration and can be configured externally. The requestTimeout method in the module returns the value of this flag, which is used to set the timeout for requests.
