The `SourceInfoRouter` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for fetching and routing the source information for a given user. The source information includes both the source signals and source graphs. 

The `get` method is the main entry point for this class. It takes in a `userId`, `product`, `userState`, and `params` as input parameters. It returns a `Future` that resolves to a tuple containing a set of `SourceInfo` objects and a map of `GraphSourceInfo` objects. 

The `getSourceSignals` method is a private method that takes in a `FetcherQuery` object and returns a `Future` that resolves to a set of `SourceInfo` objects. This method fetches the source signals from two different sources: `ussSourceSignalFetcher` and `frsSourceSignalFetcher`. It then concatenates the results and returns a set of unique `SourceInfo` objects. 

The `getSourceGraphs` method is another private method that takes in a `FetcherQuery` object and returns a `Future` that resolves to a map of `GraphSourceInfo` objects. This method fetches the source graphs from three different sources: `frsSourceGraphFetcher`, `realGraphOonSourceGraphFetcher`, and `realGraphInSourceGraphFetcher`. It then returns a map of `GraphSourceInfo` objects, where the keys are the names of the different source types. 

Overall, the `SourceInfoRouter` class is an important component of the larger project as it provides a unified interface for fetching and routing the source information for a given user. This information is used by other components of the project to generate personalized content and recommendations for the user. 

Example usage:

```scala
val sourceInfoRouter = new SourceInfoRouter(...)
val userId = UserId(...)
val product = TProduct(...)
val userState = UserState(...)
val params = configapi.Params(...)
val sourceInfoFuture = sourceInfoRouter.get(userId, product, userState, params)
sourceInfoFuture.map { case (sourceInfoSet, graphSourceInfoMap) =>
  // do something with the source info and graph source info
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a `SourceInfoRouter` class that fetches source signals and graphs for a given user and product.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `UserState`, `GraphSourceInfo`, `SourceFetcher`, `SourceType`, `TProduct`, `UserId`, `configapi`, and `Future`.

3. What is the expected output of the `get` method?
- The `get` method is expected to return a `Future` containing a tuple of a set of `SourceInfo` objects and a map of `GraphSourceInfo` objects, both of which are related to the given user and product.
