The `OfflineCandidateStoreModule` is a Scala object that provides Guice bindings for creating `ReadableStore` instances for various datasets of candidate tweets. The `ReadableStore` is a read-only key-value store that maps user IDs to lists of candidate tweets. The purpose of this module is to provide a way to access precomputed candidate tweets for recommendation systems. 

The module defines several Guice-provided methods that create `ReadableStore` instances for different datasets of candidate tweets. Each method is annotated with `@Named` to provide a unique name for the store. The names are defined in the `ModuleNames` object. The `buildOfflineCandidateStore` method is a private helper method that creates a `ReadableStore` instance for a given dataset name. It uses the `ManhattanRO` object from the `storehaus_internal.manhattan` package to create the store. The `ManhattanRO` object provides a way to read data from a Manhattan key-value store. The `ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams` object is used to configure the client for mutual TLS authentication. 

The `Injection` object from the `bijection` package is used to provide a way to serialize and deserialize `CandidateTweetsList` objects to and from byte arrays. This is necessary because the `ManhattanRO` object requires byte arrays as values. 

The `OfflineCandidateStoreModule` is used in the larger project to provide access to precomputed candidate tweets for recommendation systems. The `ReadableStore` instances created by this module can be used to retrieve candidate tweets for a given user ID. For example, the following code retrieves the candidate tweets for user ID 123 from the `OfflineTweet2020CandidateStore`:

```
val store = injector.instance[ReadableStore[Long, CandidateTweetsList]]("OfflineTweet2020CandidateStore")
val candidateTweets = store.get(123L)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a module for offline candidate stores for Twitter's recommendation system. It allows for the retrieval of recommended tweets for a given user based on various datasets.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guice, Bijection, and Finagle. It also uses Twitter-specific libraries such as ManhattanKVClientMtlsParams and Apollo.

3. What is the significance of the different dataset names used in the code?
- The different dataset names correspond to different sets of recommended tweets based on different criteria such as user interests, tweet popularity, and decay rate. Each dataset is stored in a separate offline candidate store and can be accessed using the corresponding named module.
