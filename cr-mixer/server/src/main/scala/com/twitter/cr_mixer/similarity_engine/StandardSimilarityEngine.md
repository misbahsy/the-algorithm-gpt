The `StandardSimilarityEngine` class is a straightforward implementation of the `SimilarityEngine` interface that wraps a `ReadableStore`. The purpose of this class is to provide candidate retrieval for a given query. The `ReadableStore` is a key-value store that provides a read-only view of a data source. The `StandardSimilarityEngine` class takes two type parameters: `Query` and `Candidate`. `Query` is the input type of the `ReadableStore`, and `Candidate` is the return type of the `ReadableStore`. 

The `StandardSimilarityEngine` class has a constructor that takes several parameters. The first parameter is the `implementingStore`, which is the `ReadableStore` that provides the candidate retrieval's implementations. The second parameter is the `identifier`, which is the type of the `SimilarityEngine`. The third parameter is the `globalStats`, which is a `StatsReceiver` that provides statistics for the `SimilarityEngine`. The fourth parameter is the `engineConfig`, which is a configuration object for the `SimilarityEngine`. The fifth parameter is the `memCacheConfig`, which is an optional configuration object for the MemCache layer that wraps the underlying store. 

The `StandardSimilarityEngine` class implements the `SimilarityEngine` interface, which requires the implementation of the `getCandidates` method. The `getCandidates` method takes an `EngineQuery` object as a parameter and returns a `Future` that contains an optional sequence of `Candidate` objects. The `EngineQuery` object contains the `storeQuery`, which is the query to be executed on the `ReadableStore`, and the `params`, which are the parameters for the `SimilarityEngine`. 

The `StandardSimilarityEngine` class also has a `getScopedStats` method that returns a `StatsReceiver` that provides statistics for the `SimilarityEngine`. 

The `StandardSimilarityEngine` class uses the `SimilarityEngine.getFromFn` method to retrieve the candidates from the `ReadableStore`. The `getFromFn` method takes several parameters, including the `ReadableStore`, the query to be executed, the `SimilarityEngineConfig`, the `Params`, and the `StatsReceiver`. 

Overall, the `StandardSimilarityEngine` class provides a simple implementation of the `SimilarityEngine` interface that wraps a `ReadableStore` and provides candidate retrieval for a given query. It can be used in the larger project to provide similarity-based recommendations or search results based on a user's query.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a standard implementation of a SimilarityEngine that wraps a ReadableStore.

2. What are the input and output types of the ReadableStore used in this implementation?
- The input type is Query, and the output type is Seq[Candidate].

3. What is the purpose of the MemCacheConfig parameter, and when should it be enabled?
- The MemCacheConfig parameter is used to wrap the underlying store with a MemCache layer. It should only be enabled for cacheable queries, such as TweetIds, and not for consumer-based UserIds which are generally not possible to cache.
