This code defines two case classes, `ScribeMetadata` and `RelatedTweetScribeMetadata`, along with companion objects that provide factory methods for creating instances of these classes. These classes are used for logging metadata related to candidate generation queries in the Twitter product mixer system.

The `ScribeMetadata` class contains three fields: `requestUUID`, `userId`, and `product`. The `requestUUID` field is a unique identifier for the query, while the `userId` field represents the user ID associated with the query. The `product` field is an instance of the `Product` class from the `com.twitter.cr_mixer.thriftscala` package. The companion object for `ScribeMetadata` provides factory methods for creating instances of this class from instances of `CrCandidateGeneratorQuery`, `UtegTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery`, and `AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery`. These methods extract the relevant fields from the query objects and use them to create instances of `ScribeMetadata`.

The `RelatedTweetScribeMetadata` class contains four fields: `requestUUID`, `internalId`, `clientContext`, and `product`. The `requestUUID` field is a unique identifier for the query, while the `internalId` field represents the internal ID associated with the query. The `clientContext` field is an instance of the `ClientContext` class from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.thriftscala` package. The `product` field is an instance of the `Product` class from the `com.twitter.cr_mixer.thriftscala` package. The companion object for `RelatedTweetScribeMetadata` provides a factory method for creating instances of this class from instances of `RelatedTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery`. This method extracts the relevant fields from the query object and uses them to create an instance of `RelatedTweetScribeMetadata`.

Overall, this code provides a way to log metadata related to candidate generation queries in the Twitter product mixer system. The `ScribeMetadata` and `RelatedTweetScribeMetadata` classes are used to encapsulate this metadata, while the factory methods provided by the companion objects allow instances of these classes to be created from instances of the various query classes used in the system. This metadata can then be used for monitoring and analysis purposes, allowing the system to be optimized and improved over time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines case classes and objects for generating Scribe metadata for different types of queries in the Twitter CR Mixer logging system.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on several other packages and libraries, including com.twitter.cr_mixer.model, com.twitter.cr_mixer.thriftscala, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.thriftscala, and com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala.

3. How is the ScribeMetadata case class used in the CR Mixer logging system?
- The ScribeMetadata case class is used to generate metadata for different types of queries in the CR Mixer logging system, including CrCandidateGeneratorQuery, UtegTweetCandidateGeneratorQuery, and AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery. The from methods in the ScribeMetadata object are used to create instances of ScribeMetadata from these query types.
