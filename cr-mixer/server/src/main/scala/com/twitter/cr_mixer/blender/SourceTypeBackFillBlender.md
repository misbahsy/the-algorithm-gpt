The `SourceTypeBackFillBlender` class is responsible for blending a sequence of candidate tweets based on their source type. The purpose of this blending is to create a timeline of tweets that is diverse and engaging for the user. 

The `blend` method takes in a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects, which represent the tweets that are candidates for blending. The method first filters out any empty sequences. It then partitions the remaining sequences into two groups: back fill candidates and regular candidates. Back fill candidates are tweets that are selected to fill in gaps in the timeline, while regular candidates are tweets that are selected to be interleaved with the back fill candidates. 

The partitioning is done based on the source type of each tweet. The source type is obtained from the `sourceInfoOpt` field of the `candidateGenerationInfo` object of each tweet. If the `SourceTypeBackFillEnableVideoBackFill` parameter is set to true, then the set of back fill source types includes video-related types. Otherwise, the set only includes `SourceType.UserRepeatedProfileVisit`. 

After partitioning, the regular candidates are interleaved using the `InterleaveUtil.interleave` method. The back fill candidates are also interleaved separately. The interleaved back fill candidates are then appended to the end of the interleaved regular candidates. The resulting sequence of interleaved candidates is then passed to the `BlendedCandidatesBuilder.build` method to create a sequence of `BlendedCandidate` objects. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to blend tweets based on their source type. This is useful in creating a diverse and engaging timeline for the user. The `blend` method can be called with a sequence of candidate tweets to obtain a sequence of blended tweets. 

Example usage:

```
val blender = SourceTypeBackFillBlender(globalStats)
val inputCandidates: Seq[Seq[InitialCandidate]] = Seq(Seq(candidate1, candidate2), Seq(candidate3, candidate4))
val blendedCandidates: Future[Seq[BlendedCandidate]] = blender.blend(params, inputCandidates)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a blender for candidates in Twitter's content recommendation system. It partitions candidates based on their source types, interleaves them separately, and appends back fill candidates to the end.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `blend` function?
- The `blend` function takes in a `Params` object and a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects. It outputs a `Future` of a sequence of `BlendedCandidate` objects.

3. What is the significance of the `BackFillSourceTypesWithVideo` and `BackFillSourceTypes` sets?
- These sets contain the source types that are eligible for back fill candidates. `BackFillSourceTypesWithVideo` includes source types related to video playback, while `BackFillSourceTypes` only includes the `UserRepeatedProfileVisit` source type.
