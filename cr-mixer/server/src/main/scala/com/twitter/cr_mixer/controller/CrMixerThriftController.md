The `CrMixerThriftController` class in this code is responsible for handling various types of tweet recommendation requests and generating appropriate responses. It uses different candidate generators for different types of recommendations, such as related tweets, related video tweets, topic-based tweets, and ads recommendations.

The controller handles multiple endpoints, such as `GetTweetRecommendations`, `GetRelatedTweetsForQueryTweet`, `GetRelatedVideoTweetsForQueryTweet`, `GetRelatedTweetsForQueryAuthor`, `GetFrsBasedTweetRecommendations`, `GetTopicTweetRecommendations`, `GetUtegTweetRecommendations`, and `GetAdsRecommendations`. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific type of recommendation request.

For each request, the controller first builds a query object with the necessary information, such as user ID, product, user state, and other parameters. It then calls the appropriate candidate generator to fetch the recommendations. The candidate generators include `CrCandidateGenerator`, `RelatedTweetCandidateGenerator`, `RelatedVideoTweetCandidateGenerator`, `UtegTweetCandidateGenerator`, `FrsTweetCandidateGenerator`, and `TopicTweetCandidateGenerator`.

After fetching the recommendations, the controller converts the results into the appropriate Thrift response objects, such as `CrMixerTweetResponse`, `RelatedTweetResponse`, `RelatedVideoTweetResponse`, `UtegTweetResponse`, and `AdsResponse`. It also handles caching of tweet recommendation results for certain cases, such as when the product is `t.Product.Home`.

Additionally, the controller logs various information, such as user state, request details, and response details, using different scribe loggers like `CrMixerScribeLogger`, `RelatedTweetScribeLogger`, `UtegTweetScribeLogger`, and `AdsRecommendationsScribeLogger`.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `CrMixerThriftController` class?**

   The `CrMixerThriftController` class seems to be responsible for handling various types of requests related to tweet recommendations, such as getting related tweets, related video tweets, topic-based tweets, and ads recommendations. It also handles caching and logging for these recommendations.

2. **How are the different candidate generators used in this class?**

   The class uses multiple candidate generators, such as `CrCandidateGenerator`, `RelatedTweetCandidateGenerator`, `RelatedVideoTweetCandidateGenerator`, `UtegTweetCandidateGenerator`, `FrsTweetCandidateGenerator`, and `TopicTweetCandidateGenerator`. Each generator is responsible for generating candidates for a specific type of recommendation. They are used in their respective handler methods to process the incoming requests and generate the appropriate recommendations.

3. **How does the `endpointLoadShedder` work in this class?**

   The `endpointLoadShedder` is used in various handler methods to control the load on the endpoints. It takes the endpoint name and the product's original name as arguments and wraps the processing logic for the request. If the load on the endpoint is too high, it may return a default response (e.g., an empty list of recommendations) instead of processing the request. This helps to prevent overloading the system and maintain a good performance.
