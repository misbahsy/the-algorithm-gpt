This code defines a configuration class `SimClustersANNConfig` and its companion object for the "The Algorithm from Twitter" project. The purpose of this class is to store configuration settings for the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm used in the project. The configuration settings include parameters such as the maximum number of results, minimum score, candidate embedding type, maximum top tweets per cluster, maximum scan clusters, maximum and minimum tweet candidate age, and the ANN scoring algorithm.

The companion object `SimClustersANNConfig` provides a default configuration and several predefined configurations for various experiments and use cases. These configurations are stored in the `DefaultConfigMappings` map, which maps configuration names to their corresponding `SimClustersANNConfig` instances.

The `getConfig` method in the companion object allows users to retrieve a specific configuration by providing the embedding type, model version, and configuration ID. If the requested configuration is not found in the `DefaultConfigMappings` map, an `InvalidSANNConfigException` is thrown.

Example usage:

```scala
val config = SimClustersANNConfig.getConfig("FavBasedProducer", "Model20m145k2020", "Default")
```

This code snippet retrieves the default configuration for the "FavBasedProducer_Model20m145k2020" experiment.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SimClustersANNConfig` case class and its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `SimClustersANNConfig` case class represents the configuration for the SimClusters Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm. The parameters define various settings such as the maximum number of results, minimum score, candidate embedding type, maximum top tweets per cluster, maximum scan clusters, maximum and minimum tweet candidate age, and the ANN scoring algorithm.

2. **Question**: How are the different configurations for experiments and production defined and used in this code?
   **Answer**: The different configurations are defined as private values within the `SimClustersANNConfig` object. Each configuration is a copy of the `DefaultConfig` with specific parameters modified as needed. The `DefaultConfigMappings` map is used to associate a string identifier with each configuration. The `getConfig` method takes an embedding type, model version, and ID as input and returns the corresponding configuration from the `DefaultConfigMappings` map.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `toSANNConfigThrift` method in the `SimClustersANNConfig` case class?
   **Answer**: The `toSANNConfigThrift` method is used to convert the `SimClustersANNConfig` instance into a Thrift-compatible object of type `ThriftSimClustersANNConfig`. This allows the configuration to be serialized and communicated between different services or components using the Thrift framework.
