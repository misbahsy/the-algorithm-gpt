The UtegHealthFilter class is a filter that removes unhealthy candidates from a list of InitialCandidate objects. It is designed to work with the Timeline Ranker algorithm from Twitter. The filter checks three scores (toxicityScore, pBlockScore, and pReportedTweetScore) and two additional scores (pSpammyTweetScore and spammyTweetContentScore) with the same threshold. If a candidate's tweetInfo object has a isPassTweetHealthFilterStrict value of false, it is removed from the list of candidates.

The UtegHealthFilter class is a case class that extends the FilterBase class. It is annotated with the @Singleton annotation and is injected with the @Inject annotation. The class has a name method that returns the canonical name of the class and a filter method that takes a list of candidate sequences and a configuration value and returns a Future containing a filtered list of candidate sequences. The requestToConfig method takes a CandidateGeneratorQuery object and returns a configuration value.

The UtegHealthFilter class is used in the larger Timeline Ranker algorithm to remove unhealthy candidates from a list of InitialCandidate objects. It is one of several filters that are applied to the list of candidates to determine the best candidates for a user's timeline. The filter is configurable through the UtegTweetGlobalParams.EnableTLRHealthFilterParam parameter, which can be set to true or false to enable or disable the filter. 

Example usage:

```
val filter = UtegHealthFilter()
val candidates: Seq[Seq[InitialCandidate]] = // get candidates from somewhere
val config: Boolean = true // enable filter
val filteredCandidates: Future[Seq[Seq[InitialCandidate]]] = filter.filter(candidates, config)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a filter called `UtegHealthFilter` that removes unhealthy candidates from a list of initial candidates based on certain scores.

2. What are the scores used to check the health of a candidate tweet?
    
    The filter checks three scores used by Timeline Ranker (`toxicityScore`, `pBlockScore`, and `pReportedTweetScore`) and two additional scores (`pSpammyTweetScore` and `spammyTweetContentScore`) with the same threshold.

3. What is the purpose of the `config` parameter in the `filter` method?
    
    The `config` parameter is a boolean value that determines whether the filter should be applied (`true`) or not (`false`). If `true`, the filter removes unhealthy candidates from the list of initial candidates. If `false`, the filter returns the original list of candidates.
