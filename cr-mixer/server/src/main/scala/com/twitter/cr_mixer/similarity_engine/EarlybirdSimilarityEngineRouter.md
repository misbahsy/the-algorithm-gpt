The `EarlybirdSimilarityEngineRouter` class is a router that routes search queries to different types of Earlybird similarity engines based on the specified ranking mode. The class implements the `ReadableStore` interface, which allows it to be used as a store for storing and retrieving search queries. 

The class takes in three different types of Earlybird similarity engines: `earlybirdRecencyBasedSimilarityEngine`, `earlybirdModelBasedSimilarityEngine`, and `earlybirdTensorflowBasedSimilarityEngine`. Each of these engines is of type `EarlybirdSimilarityEngine`, which is a generic class that takes in two type parameters: `SearchQuery` and `SimilarityEngineResult`. The `SearchQuery` type parameter specifies the type of search query that the engine can handle, while the `SimilarityEngineResult` type parameter specifies the type of result that the engine returns. 

The `get` method of the `EarlybirdSimilarityEngineRouter` class takes in a `Query` object, which contains information about the search query. The method uses the `rankingMode` field of the `Query` object to determine which type of Earlybird similarity engine to use. It then calls the `getCandidates` method of the appropriate engine to retrieve the search results. The `getCandidates` method takes in a `SearchQuery` object and returns a `Future` that resolves to an optional sequence of `TweetWithAuthor` objects. 

The `EarlybirdSimilarityEngineRouter` class also contains a companion object that defines a `Query` case class and three helper methods: `queryFromParams`, `recencyBasedQueryFromParams`, `tensorflowBasedQueryFromParams`, and `modelBasedQueryFromParams`. The `queryFromParams` method takes in various parameters and returns a `Query` object. The `recencyBasedQueryFromParams`, `tensorflowBasedQueryFromParams`, and `modelBasedQueryFromParams` methods take in a `Query` object and return an `EngineQuery` object that contains a `SearchQuery` object and a `Params` object. 

Overall, the `EarlybirdSimilarityEngineRouter` class is an important component of the Earlybird similarity engine system. It allows search queries to be routed to different types of similarity engines based on the specified ranking mode, which enables the system to provide more accurate and relevant search results. 

Example usage:

```scala
val router = EarlybirdSimilarityEngineRouter(
  earlybirdRecencyBasedSimilarityEngine,
  earlybirdModelBasedSimilarityEngine,
  earlybirdTensorflowBasedSimilarityEngine,
  timeoutConfig,
  statsReceiver
)

val query = EarlybirdSimilarityEngineRouter.queryFromParams(
  searcherUserId = Some(searcherUserId),
  seedUserIds = seedUserIds,
  excludedTweetIds = excludedTweetIds,
  frsUserToScoresForScoreAdjustment = None,
  params = params
)

val results = router.get(query)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a router for an Earlybird similarity engine that takes in a query and returns a sequence of tweets with authors. It solves the problem of finding similar tweets based on various criteria such as recency, model-based, or tensorflow-based similarity.

2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they used?
- This code has dependencies on various classes and packages such as TimeoutConfig, TweetWithAuthor, SnowflakeId, and ReadableStore. These dependencies are used to configure the router and provide necessary functionality for the similarity engine.

3. How does this code handle different types of similarity engines and queries?
- This code uses a case class called Query to handle different types of similarity engines and queries. It also uses pattern matching to determine the ranking mode of the query and calls the appropriate similarity engine method to get the candidates. Additionally, it uses private methods to convert the query into the appropriate engine query for each type of similarity engine.
