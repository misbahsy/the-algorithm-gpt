The `FrsStore` class is a Scala implementation of a `ReadableStore` that retrieves follow recommendations from Twitter's Follow Recommendations Service (FRS). The class takes in a `FollowRecommendationsThriftService.MethodPerEndpoint` object, a `StatsReceiver` object, and a `CrMixerDecider` object as parameters. The `get` method of the class takes in a `Query` object and returns a `Future` of an `Option` of a sequence of `FrsQueryResult` objects. 

The `buildFollowRecommendationRequest` method is a private method that takes in a `Query` object and returns a `RecommendationRequest` object. The `RecommendationRequest` object is used to make a request to the FRS to retrieve follow recommendations. The `get` method first checks if the FRS traffic decider is enabled. If it is, the `buildFollowRecommendationRequest` method is called to build the request, and the `getRecommendations` method of the `frsClient` object is called with the request as a parameter. The response is then mapped to a sequence of `FrsQueryResult` objects and returned as a `Future` of an `Option`. If the FRS traffic decider is not enabled, the method returns `Future.None`.

The `Query` case class defines the parameters that can be used to query the FRS. The `FrsQueryResult` case class defines the results of a query to the FRS. The `userId` parameter is the ID of the user for whom the recommendations are being generated. The `maxConsumerSeedsNum` parameter is the maximum number of recommendations to return. The `displayLocation` parameter is the location where the recommendations will be displayed. The `excludedUserIds` parameter is a sequence of user IDs to exclude from the recommendations. The `languageCodeOpt` and `countryCodeOpt` parameters are optional parameters that specify the language and country codes for the recommendations.

This class is used in the larger project to retrieve follow recommendations for users. It is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods to generate personalized recommendations for users based on their interests and activity on the platform. An example of how this class might be used is as follows:

```
val frsStore = FrsStore(frsClient, statsReceiver, decider)
val query = Query(userId, maxConsumerSeedsNum, displayLocation, excludedUserIds, languageCodeOpt, countryCodeOpt)
val recommendations = frsStore.get(query)
```

This code creates a `FrsStore` object with the appropriate parameters, creates a `Query` object with the desired parameters, and calls the `get` method of the `FrsStore` object with the `Query` object as a parameter. The `recommendations` variable will contain a `Future` of an `Option` of a sequence of `FrsQueryResult` objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a `FrsStore` class that implements a `ReadableStore` interface and retrieves recommendations from a Follow Recommendations Service (FRS) client. It solves the problem of providing recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior.

2. What dependencies does this code have and how are they used?
- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including `com.twitter.cr_mixer.param.decider.CrMixerDecider`, `com.twitter.cr_mixer.source_signal.FrsStore.Query`, `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.thriftscala.ClientContext`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.thriftscala.DisplayLocation`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.thriftscala.FollowRecommendationsThriftService`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.thriftscala.Recommendation`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.thriftscala.RecommendationRequest`, `com.twitter.storehaus.ReadableStore`, `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common.UserId`, and `com.twitter.util.Future`. They are used to define the `FrsStore` class and its methods, and to interact with the FRS client and other services.

3. What is the role of the `CrMixerDecider` and how does it affect the behavior of the `get` method?
- The `CrMixerDecider` is used to determine whether the FRS traffic should be enabled or not, based on the value of the `DeciderConstants.enableFRSTrafficDeciderKey` constant. If the traffic is enabled, the `get` method will build a recommendation request based on the input query and retrieve recommendations from the FRS client. Otherwise, it will return a `Future.None`.
