The `UssStore` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for retrieving user signals from the User Signal Service (USS) based on a given query. The USS is a service that collects and processes user signals, which are actions taken by users on the Twitter platform, such as liking a tweet or following an account. These signals are used to improve the relevance of content and recommendations for users.

The `UssStore` class takes in a `ReadableStore` of `BatchSignalRequest` and `BatchSignalResponse` objects, which are used to retrieve user signals from the USS. It also takes in a `StatsReceiver` object for tracking statistics related to the USS queries.

The `UssStore` class has a `get` method that takes in a `Query` object, which contains the user ID, query parameters, and product type. The `get` method uses the query parameters to build a list of `SignalRequest` objects, which specify the type of user signals to retrieve from the USS. The `get` method then creates a `BatchSignalRequest` object using the user ID, list of `SignalRequest` objects, and product type. This `BatchSignalRequest` object is passed to the `stratoStore` to retrieve the corresponding `BatchSignalResponse` object. The `BatchSignalResponse` object is then processed to extract the user signals and their corresponding signal types.

The `buildUserSignalServiceRequests` method is used to build the list of `SignalRequest` objects based on the query parameters. The method checks each query parameter to determine if the corresponding user signal type should be included in the list of `SignalRequest` objects. If the user signal type should be included, a `SignalRequest` object is created with the appropriate parameters.

Overall, the `UssStore` class is an important component of the larger project that retrieves user signals from the USS to improve the relevance of content and recommendations for users on the Twitter platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a `UssStore` class that implements a `ReadableStore` interface and contains methods for retrieving user signals from a store based on various parameters.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code has several external dependencies, including `com.twitter.cr_mixer`, `com.twitter.finagle`, `com.twitter.simclusters_v2`, and `com.twitter.usersignalservice`.

3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` annotation on the `UssStore` class?
- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of the `UssStore` class should be created and shared across the application. This can help improve performance and reduce resource usage.
