The `PreRankFilterRunner` class is a filter runner that applies a sequence of filters to a set of initial candidates. The purpose of this class is to filter out candidates that do not meet certain criteria before they are ranked. The class takes in five filters as dependencies: `impressedTweetListFilter`, `tweetAgeFilter`, `videoTweetFilter`, `tweetReplyFilter`, and `globalStats`. The `orderedFilters` variable is a sequence of these filters in the order in which they should be applied. 

The `runSequentialFilters` method takes in a `CandidateGeneratorQuery` object and a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects. It applies the sequence of filters in `orderedFilters` to the candidates in the input sequence. The method returns a `Future` that resolves to a sequence of sequences of `InitialCandidate` objects that have passed through all the filters. 

The `PreRankFilterRunner` class uses the `runSequentialFilters` method of the companion object `PreRankFilterRunner` to apply the filters. The companion object contains two helper methods: `recordCandidateStatsBeforeFilter` and `recordCandidateStatsAfterFilter`. These methods record statistics about the candidates before and after each filter is applied. The `runSequentialFilters` method applies each filter in `orderedFilters` to the candidates in the input sequence using `foldLeft`. It records the candidate statistics before and after each filter is applied using the helper methods. 

Overall, the `PreRankFilterRunner` class is an important part of the larger project as it filters out candidates that do not meet certain criteria before they are ranked. This helps to improve the quality of the ranked candidates and ensures that only the best candidates are presented to the user. 

Example usage:

```scala
val filterRunner = new PreRankFilterRunner(
  impressedTweetListFilter,
  tweetAgeFilter,
  videoTweetFilter,
  tweetReplyFilter,
  globalStats
)

val query = new CandidateGeneratorQuery(...)
val candidates = Seq(Seq(new InitialCandidate(...)), Seq(new InitialCandidate(...)))
val filteredCandidatesFuture = filterRunner.runSequentialFilters(query, candidates)

filteredCandidatesFuture.map { filteredCandidates =>
  // do something with the filtered candidates
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a PreRankFilterRunner class that runs a sequence of filters on a set of candidate tweets to generate an ordered list of initial candidates for a recommendation system. It solves the problem of filtering out irrelevant or low-quality tweets from the initial set of candidates.

2. What filters are being applied to the candidate tweets and in what order?
- The filters being applied are tweetAgeFilter, impressedTweetListFilter, videoTweetFilter, and tweetReplyFilter. The order of the filters does not matter as long as they are not all truncated at the same limit.

3. How are the statistics for the filters being recorded and what information is being tracked?
- The statistics for the filters are being recorded using a StatsReceiver object. The recordCandidateStatsBeforeFilter and recordCandidateStatsAfterFilter methods are used to track the number of empty sources and the number of candidates before and after each filter is applied. The information is tracked for each filter separately and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of each filter.
