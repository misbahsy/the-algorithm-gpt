The `AdsCandidateSourcesRouter` class in this code is responsible for fetching and processing ad candidates for a given user based on various sources and similarity engines. The main function `fetchCandidates` takes a user ID, source signals, real graph seeds, and configuration parameters as input and returns a future sequence of initial ad candidates.

The code fetches ad candidates from multiple sources such as SimClustersANN, UserAdGraph, and TwHIN, and applies various filters and transformations to the candidates. For example, it filters out candidates based on their age, score, and line item information. It also sorts and limits the number of candidates per source.

Here's an example of how the code fetches candidates from SimClustersANN:

```scala
val simClustersANN1ConfigId = params(SimClustersANNParams.SimClustersANN1ConfigId)
val tweetBasedSANNMinScore = params(TweetBasedCandidateGenerationParams.SimClustersMinScoreParam)
val tweetBasedSANN1Candidates = if (params(TweetBasedCandidateGenerationParams.EnableSimClustersANN1Param)) {
  Future.collect(CandidateSourcesRouter.getTweetBasedSourceInfo(sourceSignals).toSeq.map { sourceInfo =>
    getSimClustersANNCandidates(requestUserId, Some(sourceInfo), params, simClustersANN1ConfigId, tweetBasedSANNMinScore)
  })
} else Future.value(Seq.empty)
```

The code also converts the fetched candidates into `InitialAdsCandidate` objects, which include the tweet ID, line item information, and candidate generation information.

```scala
InitialAdsCandidate(
  tweetId = candidate.tweetId,
  lineItemInfo = lineItemInfo,
  candidate.candidateGenerationInfo
)
```

In the larger project, this class would be used to fetch and process ad candidates for a given user, which can then be ranked and served to the user as part of the ad recommendation system.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `AdsCandidateSourcesRouter` class and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `AdsCandidateSourcesRouter` class is responsible for fetching and processing candidates for ads based on various similarity engines and source signals. It provides methods to get candidates from different similarity engines like SimClustersANN, UserAdGraph, TwHIN, and ConsumerBasedWals.

2. **Question**: How does the `fetchCandidates` method work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `fetchCandidates` method takes a `requestUserId`, a set of `sourceSignals`, a map of `realGraphSeeds`, and a `params` object as inputs. It fetches candidates from various similarity engines based on the provided parameters and source signals. The method returns a `Future[Seq[Seq[InitialAdsCandidate]]]`, which is a future containing a sequence of sequences of initial ads candidates.

3. **Question**: How are the different similarity engines used in the `AdsCandidateSourcesRouter` class?
   **Answer**: The different similarity engines are used by calling their respective `getCandidates` methods with appropriate query parameters. These engines include `simClustersANNSimilarityEngine`, `tweetBasedUserAdGraphSimilarityEngine`, `consumersBasedUserAdGraphSimilarityEngine`, `producerBasedUserAdGraphSimilarityEngine`, `tweetBasedTwHINANNSimilarityEngine`, `consumerTwHINANNSimilarityEngine`, and `consumerBasedWalsSimilarityEngine`. The results from these engines are combined and processed to generate the final list of candidates.
