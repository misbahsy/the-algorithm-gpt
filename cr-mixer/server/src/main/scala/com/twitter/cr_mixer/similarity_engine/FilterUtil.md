The `FilterUtil` object in the `com.twitter.cr_mixer.similarity_engine` package provides two methods for filtering tweets and tweet sources based on their age. 

The `tweetAgeFilter` method takes a sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects and a `Duration` representing the maximum age of tweets to include in the filtered sequence. It returns a new sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects that were generated less than `maxTweetAgeHours` hours ago. The method calculates the earliest tweet ID that should be included in the filtered sequence based on the current time and the maximum tweet age. It then filters the input sequence by comparing each tweet's ID to the earliest ID. If the tweet's ID is greater than or equal to the earliest ID, it is included in the filtered sequence. 

The `tweetSourceAgeFilter` method takes a sequence of `SourceInfo` objects and a `Duration` representing the maximum age of tweet sources to include in the filtered sequence. It returns a new sequence of `SourceInfo` objects that were generated less than `maxTweetSignalAgeHoursParam` hours ago. The method calculates the earliest tweet ID that should be included in the filtered sequence based on the current time and the maximum tweet source age. It then filters the input sequence by checking each source's internal ID. If the internal ID is a tweet ID and its value is greater than or equal to the earliest ID, the source is included in the filtered sequence. Otherwise, it is excluded. 

These methods are likely used in the larger project to filter tweets and tweet sources before performing similarity calculations or other analyses. By excluding older tweets and sources, the project can focus on more recent data that is likely to be more relevant and informative. 

Example usage:

```
import com.twitter.cr_mixer.similarity_engine.FilterUtil
import com.twitter.cr_mixer.model.TweetWithScore
import com.twitter.cr_mixer.model.SourceInfo
import com.twitter.util.Duration

val tweets: Seq[TweetWithScore] = Seq(...)
val sources: Seq[SourceInfo] = Seq(...)
val maxAge: Duration = Duration.fromHours(24)

val filteredTweets = FilterUtil.tweetAgeFilter(tweets, maxAge)
val filteredSources = FilterUtil.tweetSourceAgeFilter(sources, maxAge)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides two functions for filtering tweets and tweet sources based on their age.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several packages from Twitter libraries, including `com.twitter.cr_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.snowflake.id`, and `com.twitter.util`.

3. How does the tweetAgeFilter function work?
- The tweetAgeFilter function takes a sequence of TweetWithScore objects and a Duration parameter, and returns a filtered sequence of TweetWithScore objects where the tweet IDs are greater than or equal to the earliest permitted tweet ID based on the maximum tweet age. The earliest permitted tweet ID is calculated using the SnowflakeId.firstIdFor method and the current time minus the maximum tweet age.
