The code defines a set of parameters related to video tweets and creates a configuration object for these parameters. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for managing and accessing these parameters throughout the larger project.

The `RelatedVideoTweetGlobalParams` object contains a single parameter called `MaxCandidatesPerRequestParam`, which is an integer value representing the maximum number of candidate video tweets that can be returned in a single request. This parameter is defined as a `FSBoundedParam`, which is a type of parameter that has a minimum and maximum value.

The `AllParams` sequence contains all of the parameters defined in the `RelatedVideoTweetGlobalParams` object. This sequence can be used to iterate over all of the parameters and perform operations on them.

The `config` object is a `BaseConfig` object that contains the configuration for the parameters defined in `RelatedVideoTweetGlobalParams`. This object is created using a `BaseConfigBuilder`, which sets the configuration overrides for the `MaxCandidatesPerRequestParam` parameter. These overrides are obtained using the `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` class, which provides a way to override feature switch parameters.

Overall, this code provides a way to manage and access video tweet parameters in a centralized location. Other parts of the larger project can use the `AllParams` sequence and `config` object to access and modify these parameters as needed. For example, if a new parameter needs to be added or an existing parameter needs to be modified, it can be done in this file and the changes will be reflected throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a set of parameters related to video tweets and creates a configuration object for them.
2. What is the significance of the `FSBoundedParam` and `FSName` classes?
   - `FSBoundedParam` is a class that defines a parameter with a minimum and maximum value, while `FSName` is a trait that provides a name for the parameter. Both are used in defining the `MaxCandidatesPerRequestParam` object.
3. How are the parameter values overridden or modified?
   - The `config` object is created using `BaseConfigBuilder` and `FeatureSwitchOverrideUtil` to set any overrides for the parameter values. In this case, `intOverrides` is used to set any bounded integer overrides for the `MaxCandidatesPerRequestParam` parameter.
