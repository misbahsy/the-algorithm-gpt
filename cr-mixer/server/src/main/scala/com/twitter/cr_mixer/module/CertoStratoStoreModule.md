The `CertoStratoStoreModule` is a Scala object that provides a Guice module for creating a `ReadableStore` object that can be used to retrieve a sequence of `TweetWithScores` objects for a given `TopicId`. The purpose of this module is to create a cache of top tweets for a given topic that can be used by other parts of the larger project.

The `providesCertoStratoStore` method is annotated with `@Provides`, `@Singleton`, and `@Named(ModuleNames.CertoStratoStoreName)`. This method takes three parameters: a `MemcachedClient` object, a `Client` object, and a `StatsReceiver` object. The `MemcachedClient` object is used to cache the results of the `ReadableStore` object, while the `Client` object is used to retrieve the top tweets for a given topic. The `StatsReceiver` object is used to record statistics about the cache.

The `providesCertoStratoStore` method creates a `ReadableStore` object by first creating an `ObservedReadableStore` object that wraps a `CertoTopicTopKTweetsStore` object retrieved from the `stratoClient`. The `ObservedReadableStore` object is then mapped to a new `ReadableStore` object that returns only the top tweets by follower L2 normalized cosine similarity score. This new `ReadableStore` object is then wrapped in an `ObservedMemcachedReadableStore` object that caches the results in the `MemcachedClient` object for 10 minutes.

The `ObservedMemcachedReadableStore` object is then wrapped in an `ObservedCachedReadableStore` object that caches the results in memory for 5 minutes. This in-memory cache has a maximum size of 100,000 keys and a window size of 10,000. Finally, the `ReadableStore` object is returned.

This module can be used by other parts of the larger project to retrieve the top tweets for a given topic. For example, the following code can be used to retrieve the top tweets for a topic with ID `123`:

```
val store = injector.instance[ReadableStore[TopicId, Seq[TweetWithScores]]](ModuleNames.CertoStratoStoreName)
val topTweets = Await.result(store.get(TopicId(123)), 5.seconds)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides a module for creating a readable store of tweets with scores for a given topic, using a combination of a Strato client and a Memcached client. It solves the problem of efficiently caching and retrieving tweet data for topic recommendations.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several libraries and modules, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, Twitter Hermit, Twitter Inject, Twitter Storehaus, and Twitter Topic Recos.

3. What caching strategies are being used in this code?
- This code uses a combination of in-memory caching and Memcached caching to store and retrieve tweet data. The Memcached cache has a time-to-live (TTL) of 10 minutes, while the in-memory cache has a TTL of 5 minutes and a maximum number of keys of 100,000.
