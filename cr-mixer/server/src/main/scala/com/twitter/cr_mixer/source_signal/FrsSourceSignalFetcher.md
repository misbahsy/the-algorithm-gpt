The `FrsSourceSignalFetcher` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is responsible for fetching and processing signals related to follow recommendations. It extends the `SourceSignalFetcher` trait and overrides its methods to implement the specific functionality required for fetching and processing follow recommendation signals.

The class takes in a `ReadableStore` of `FrsStore.Query` and `Seq[FrsQueryResult]` as a dependency, which is used to fetch the raw signals related to follow recommendations. It also takes in a `TimeoutConfig` and a `StatsReceiver` as dependencies, which are used for timeout configuration and tracking statistics related to the fetcher, respectively.

The `isEnabled` method is used to determine whether the fetcher is enabled for a given query. It checks the value of the `FrsParams.EnableSourceParam` parameter in the query's parameters map and returns `true` if it is set to `true`.

The `fetchAndProcess` method is used to fetch and process the raw signals related to follow recommendations. It first fetches the raw signals using the `frsStore` dependency and maps over the result to extract the user IDs of the recommended users. It then converts these user IDs into `SourceInfo` objects using the `convertSourceInfo` method and returns them wrapped in an `Option` and a `Future`.

The `convertSourceInfo` method is used to convert the user IDs of the recommended users into `SourceInfo` objects. It takes in a `SourceType` and a sequence of user IDs as parameters and maps over the user IDs to create a `SourceInfo` object for each user ID.

Overall, the `FrsSourceSignalFetcher` class is an important component of the follow recommendation algorithm in the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project. It fetches and processes signals related to follow recommendations and converts them into `SourceInfo` objects that can be used by other components of the algorithm.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a Scala implementation of a FrsSourceSignalFetcher, which is a module that fetches and processes signals from a FrsStore to generate a sequence of SourceInfo objects. It solves the problem of generating source signals for Twitter's content recommendation system.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code has dependencies on several other modules and libraries, including TimeoutConfig, ModuleNames, SourceInfo, FrsParams, GlobalParams, FrsStore, SourceFetcher, SourceType, StatsReceiver, UserId, InternalId, ReadableStore, Future, javax.inject.Singleton, javax.inject.Inject, and javax.inject.Named.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The expected input of this code is a FetcherQuery object, which contains a user ID and a set of parameters. The expected output is a Future object that resolves to an optional sequence of SourceInfo objects.
