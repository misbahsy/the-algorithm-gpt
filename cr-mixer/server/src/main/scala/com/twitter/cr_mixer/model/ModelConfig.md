The `ModelConfig` class is a configuration class for all Model Based Candidate Sources. It contains a list of model IDs that are used for different product surfaces. The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for storing and accessing model IDs used throughout the project. 

The class is implemented as an object, which means it is a singleton and can be accessed from anywhere in the codebase. It contains a list of model IDs that are used for different product surfaces. These model IDs are stored as string constants and are used to identify the different models used in the project. 

The class also contains a list of all the HnswANNSimilarityEngines model IDs. These are used to identify the models that use the HnswANNSimilarityEngines algorithm. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a centralized location for storing and accessing model IDs used throughout the project. This makes it easier to manage and update the models used in the project. 

Example usage:

```scala
val modelId = ModelConfig.OfflineFavDecayedSum
```

This code retrieves the model ID for the `OfflineFavDecayedSum` model from the `ModelConfig` object. This ID can then be used to retrieve the model from the project's storage or to pass it as a parameter to a function that uses the model.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a Configuration class for all Model Based Candidate Sources in the Twitter CR Mixer project. It provides a list of model IDs for various types of models used in the project.

2. What is the naming convention for model IDs in this project?
- The naming convention for model IDs is "Algorithm_Product_Date". If a model is used for multiple product surfaces, it should be named as "all". The name "MBCG" should not be used for any algorithm.

3. What is the significance of the `allHnswANNSimilarityEngineModelIds` list?
- The `allHnswANNSimilarityEngineModelIds` list contains the model IDs for all HnswANNSimilarityEngines used in the project. It is used to reference these models in other parts of the code.
