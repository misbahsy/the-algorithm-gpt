The `SourceGraphFetcher` trait is a specialized implementation of the `SourceFetcher` trait that is used to fetch user graph data, such as RealGraphOon and FRS. The `ResultType` of a `SourceGraphFetcher` is a `GraphSourceInfo` object that contains a `userSeedSet`. When a `userId` is passed in, the underlying store returns a single `GraphSourceInfo` object.

The `SourceGraphFetcher` trait defines a `RawDataType` type that contains a consumer's seed `UserId` and a score (weight). It also defines a `graphSourceType` field that specifies the type of graph source being fetched.

The trait provides two methods for tracking statistics on the fetched data: `trackStats` and `trackPerItemStats`. Both methods take a `FetcherQuery` object and a function that returns a `Future` of the fetched data. The `trackStats` method tracks statistics on the entire fetched data set, while `trackPerItemStats` tracks statistics on each individual item in the fetched data set.

The `convertGraphSourceInfo` method is used to convert a `Seq` of `RawDataType` objects into a `GraphSourceInfo` object. It does this by mapping each `RawDataType` object to a tuple of `(UserId, Double)` and then converting the resulting `Seq` to a `Map` that is used to populate the `seedWithScores` field of the `GraphSourceInfo` object.

Overall, the `SourceGraphFetcher` trait provides a way to fetch and process user graph data for use in the larger project. It also provides a mechanism for tracking statistics on the fetched data, which can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of the system. An example usage of this trait might be to fetch user graph data for a recommendation engine that suggests new users to follow based on their existing social connections.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?
- This code defines a trait called `SourceGraphFetcher` that extends from `SourceFetcher` and is specialized in fetching user graph data. It is likely part of a larger project that involves analyzing user data on Twitter.

2. What is the `ResultType` of a `SourceGraphFetcher` and what information does it contain?
- The `ResultType` of a `SourceGraphFetcher` is a `GraphSourceInfo` object which contains a `userSeedSet`. When a `userId` is passed in, the underlying store returns one `GraphSourceInfo`.

3. What is the purpose of the `trackStats` and `trackPerItemStats` methods?
- The `trackStats` and `trackPerItemStats` methods are used to track statistics on the fetched data. `trackStats` tracks statistics on the overall fetch operation, while `trackPerItemStats` tracks statistics on each individual item in the fetched data.
