The `CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration` class is a candidate generator that fetches similar tweets from multiple customized retrieval-based candidate sources. It is designed to return candidates from different similarity engines without blending, meaning it is not a unified similarity engine but rather a candidate generator that calls multiple singular similarity engines.

The main function of this class is `get(query: Query)`, which takes a `Query` object as input and returns a `Future[Option[Seq[Seq[TweetWithCandidateGenerationInfo]]]]`. The `Query` object contains various parameters such as `internalId`, `maxCandidateNumPerSourceKey`, `maxTweetAgeHours`, and flags to enable or disable specific similarity engines. The `get` function processes the query by fetching candidates from enabled similarity engines, such as `twhinCollabFilterSimilarityEngine`, `twhinMultiCluster`, and `diffusionBasedSimilarityEngine`. It then interleaves the candidates from different sources and returns a sequence of `TweetWithCandidateGenerationInfo` objects.

The class also provides utility functions for filtering and processing the candidates. The `tweetAgeFilter` function filters out tweets that are older than a specified duration, while the `ageFilterWithStats` function filters candidates based on their age and logs metrics. The `getTwhinCollabCandidatesWithCGInfo` and `getDiffusionBasedCandidatesWithCGInfo` functions convert the candidates fetched from the similarity engines into `TweetWithCandidateGenerationInfo` objects.

Here's an example of how this class may be used in the larger project:

```scala
val customizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration = CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration(...)
val query = CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration.Query(...)
val candidatesFuture = customizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration.get(query)
candidatesFuture.map { candidatesOption =>
  // Process the candidates
}
```

In summary, the `CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration` class is responsible for fetching and processing similar tweets from multiple customized retrieval-based candidate sources, making it a key component in the larger project for generating tweet recommendations.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration` class and how does it differ from the `TweetBasedCandidateGeneration` class?
   **Answer**: The `CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration` class is a candidate generator that fetches similar tweets from multiple customized retrieval based candidate sources. It differs from the `TweetBasedCandidateGeneration` class in that it returns candidates from different similarity engines without blending, meaning it is not a unified similarity engine but rather a candidate generator that calls multiple singular similarity engines.

2. **Question**: How does the `get` method work in the `CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration` class and what is its output?
   **Answer**: The `get` method takes a `Query` object as input and fetches similar tweet candidates from multiple similarity engines based on the query parameters. It returns a `Future[Option[Seq[Seq[TweetWithCandidateGenerationInfo]]]]`, which is a future containing an optional sequence of sequences of `TweetWithCandidateGenerationInfo` objects, representing the tweet candidates along with their candidate generation information.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `tweetAgeFilter` method and how is it used in the `CustomizedRetrievalCandidateGeneration` class?
   **Answer**: The `tweetAgeFilter` method is used to filter out tweet candidates that are older than a specified maximum age (in hours). It takes a sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects and a `maxTweetAgeHours` duration as input, and returns a sequence of `TweetWithScore` objects that are generated within the specified maximum age. This method is used within the `ageFilterWithStats` method to apply the age filter on the tweet candidates while also logging relevant metrics.
