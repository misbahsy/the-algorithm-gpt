This file contains protocol buffer message definitions for the TensorFlow Distributed Runtime API. The API provides functionality for distributed TensorFlow training and inference. The file defines message types for various methods of the API, including CreateSession, ExtendSession, RunStep, CloseSession, ListDevices, MakeCallable, RunCallable, and ReleaseCallable.

The CreateSession method is used to create a new session with an initial graph definition and configuration options. The ExtendSession method is used to add nodes to an existing session's graph. The RunStep method is used to execute a step in the session's graph, providing input tensors and specifying output tensors to fetch. The CloseSession method is used to close a session. The ListDevices method returns information about the available devices for the master. The MakeCallable method creates a callable object that can be used to execute a subgraph with specified input and output tensors. The RunCallable method executes a callable object with specified input tensors and returns output tensors. The ReleaseCallable method releases the resources associated with a callable object.

Each message type is defined with required and optional fields that correspond to the parameters of the corresponding API method. For example, the CreateSessionRequest message type has fields for the initial graph definition, configuration options, and target string. The CreateSessionResponse message type has fields for the session handle and initial graph version number.

The message types are defined using protocol buffer syntax, which allows for efficient serialization and deserialization of messages. The message types can be used in conjunction with gRPC to implement the Distributed Runtime API in various programming languages. For example, in Python, the message types can be generated using the protobuf compiler and used with the grpcio library to implement the API.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines the protocol buffer messages used for communication between a TensorFlow client and a TensorFlow master service for creating and extending sessions, running steps, resetting sessions, listing available devices, and creating and running callables.

2. What is the license for this code?
- This code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

3. What are the different types of messages defined in this code?
- This code defines messages for creating and extending sessions (CreateSessionRequest, CreateSessionResponse, ExtendSessionRequest, ExtendSessionResponse), running steps (RunStepRequest, RunStepResponse), setting up partial runs (PartialRunSetupRequest, PartialRunSetupResponse), resetting sessions (ResetRequest, ResetResponse), listing available devices (ListDevicesRequest, ListDevicesResponse), creating callables (MakeCallableRequest, MakeCallableResponse), and running callables (RunCallableRequest, RunCallableResponse).
