This code defines and registers various metrics for monitoring the performance of a machine learning model inference service. The metrics are defined using the Prometheus library and include counters, gauges, and histograms. The purpose of these metrics is to provide insight into the behavior of the service and to help identify and diagnose issues.

The `lazy_static` macro is used to define static instances of the metrics, which are then registered with a Prometheus registry. The `register_custom_metrics` function is used to register the metrics with the registry. The `register_dynamic_metrics` function can be used to register dynamic metrics, which are not defined statically.

The `metrics_handler` function is an HTTP handler that returns the current values of all registered metrics in Prometheus text format. This allows the metrics to be scraped by a Prometheus server for monitoring and alerting.

Some examples of the metrics defined in this code include:

- `NUM_REQUESTS_RECEIVED`: A counter of the number of requests received by the service.
- `RESPONSE_TIME_COLLECTOR`: A histogram of response times for requests, with buckets ranging from 0 to 1000 ms.
- `NUM_PREDICTIONS`: A counter of the number of predictions made by the model.
- `MODEL_INFERENCE_TIME_COLLECTOR`: A histogram of model inference times, with buckets ranging from 0 to 1000 ms.

Overall, this code provides a framework for monitoring the performance of a machine learning model inference service and can be used to identify and diagnose issues with the service.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines various Prometheus metrics for tracking the performance and behavior of a machine learning model inference service called "Navi".
2. What types of metrics are being tracked?
   - The metrics being tracked include counters, gauges, and histograms, and they measure things like the number of requests received, the number of predictions made, the size of batches, and the time it takes to perform inference.
3. How are the metrics registered and collected?
   - The metrics are registered using the Prometheus `Registry` and `Opts` structs, and they are collected using the `gather()` method. The `register()` method is used to add each metric to the registry, and the `Encoder` struct is used to encode the metrics as text for output. The `metrics_handler()` function is used to handle HTTP requests for the metrics.
