The code provided includes two functions: `load_batch_prediction_request_base64` and `save_to_npy`. 

The `load_batch_prediction_request_base64` function takes a file name as input and returns a vector of vectors of bytes. It opens the file, reads each line, and attempts to decode the line from base64 format. If the decoding is successful, the resulting payload is added to the vector of vectors. If there is an error decoding the line, an error message is printed to the console. Finally, the function returns the vector of vectors. This function may be used to load a batch of prediction requests in base64 format from a file and decode them for further processing.

The `save_to_npy` function takes a slice of data and a file name as input and saves the data to a file in numpy's .npy format. It creates a writer with default options, sets the shape of the data to be a one-dimensional array with length equal to the length of the input data, and writes the data to the file. This function may be used to save data in a format that can be easily loaded into numpy for further analysis.

Overall, these functions provide basic functionality for loading and saving data in formats commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. They may be used as building blocks for more complex algorithms and pipelines.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the npyz crate and how is it being used in this code?
- The smart developer might ask what the npyz crate is and how it is being used in this code. The npyz crate is being used to serialize and deserialize numpy arrays in Rust. It is being used to write data to a file in npy format in the `save_to_npy` function and to build a writer in the `load_batch_prediction_request_base64` function.

2. What is the expected format of the input file in the `load_batch_prediction_request_base64` function?
- The smart developer might ask what the expected format of the input file is in the `load_batch_prediction_request_base64` function. The input file is expected to contain base64-encoded data, with each line representing a separate payload to be decoded and added to the result vector.

3. What is the purpose of the `save_to_npy` function and how is it being used?
- The smart developer might ask what the purpose of the `save_to_npy` function is and how it is being used. The `save_to_npy` function is being used to write data to a file in npy format. It takes a slice of data that implements the `npyz::Serialize` and `AutoSerialize` traits, and a string representing the file path to write to. The function creates a writer with the specified options and writes the data to the file.
