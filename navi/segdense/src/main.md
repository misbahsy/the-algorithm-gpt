This code is a Rust program that reads a JSON schema file and loads it into memory. The program uses the `std::env` and `std::fs` modules to read command line arguments and file contents, respectively. It also uses the `segdense` crate, which provides utilities for working with dense vectors and matrices.

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It first initializes a logger using the `env_logger` crate. Then, it reads the command line arguments into a vector of strings. If there is only one argument (the name of the program), the program assumes that the schema file is located in the `json/compact.json` file. Otherwise, the program uses the first argument as the name of the schema file.

Next, the program reads the contents of the schema file into a string using the `fs::read_to_string()` function. If the file cannot be read, an error is returned. Otherwise, the program passes the string to the `util::safe_load_config()` function, which loads the schema into memory and performs some validation. If the schema is invalid, an error is returned. Otherwise, the program exits with a success status.

This code is likely part of a larger project that uses JSON schemas to validate data. The program could be used to load a schema file at runtime and validate data against it. For example, a web application could use this program to load a schema file that defines the structure of incoming JSON requests. The application could then use the schema to validate the requests and reject any that do not conform to the schema.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `segdense` crate and how is it being used in this code?
   - The smart developer might ask this question to understand the role of the `segdense` crate in the project and how it is being utilized in this specific file.
2. What is the expected format of the JSON schema file being read in this code?
   - The smart developer might ask this question to ensure that the JSON schema file being read is in the correct format and to understand any potential issues that could arise if the format is incorrect.
3. What is the purpose of the `safe_load_config` function and what kind of errors can it return?
   - The smart developer might ask this question to understand the role of the `safe_load_config` function and what kind of errors it can return, in order to handle them appropriately in the code.
