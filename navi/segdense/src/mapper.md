This code defines a feature mapping system using a HashMap data structure. The purpose of this system is to map feature IDs to their corresponding FeatureInfo objects. FeatureInfo is a struct that contains two fields: tensor_index and index_within_tensor. 

The code begins by importing the HashMap data structure from the standard library. It then defines the FeatureInfo struct with two fields: tensor_index and index_within_tensor. These fields are both integers, with tensor_index being an 8-bit signed integer and index_within_tensor being a 64-bit signed integer. 

The code then defines a static variable called NULL_INFO, which is an instance of the FeatureInfo struct with both fields set to -1. This is used as a default value for FeatureInfo objects that have not been initialized. 

Next, the code defines a FeatureMapper struct that contains a HashMap called map. This HashMap maps i64 integers (feature IDs) to FeatureInfo objects. The FeatureMapper struct also has a new() method that creates a new instance of the struct with an empty HashMap. 

The code then defines two traits: MapWriter and MapReader. MapWriter is a trait that defines a set() method that takes a feature ID and a FeatureInfo object and adds them to the HashMap. MapReader is a trait that defines a get() method that takes a feature ID and returns an Option containing a reference to the corresponding FeatureInfo object. 

Finally, the code implements the MapWriter and MapReader traits for the FeatureMapper struct. The set() method simply inserts the feature ID and FeatureInfo object into the HashMap. The get() method returns an Option containing a reference to the FeatureInfo object corresponding to the given feature ID. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to map feature IDs to their corresponding FeatureInfo objects using a HashMap. This feature mapping system could be used in a variety of machine learning or data analysis applications where it is necessary to keep track of feature information. For example, it could be used in a natural language processing system to map words to their corresponding embeddings or in a recommender system to map user preferences to their corresponding feature vectors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the FeatureMapper struct and its associated traits?
- The FeatureMapper struct is used to map feature IDs to their corresponding FeatureInfo struct. The MapWriter trait is used to set the mapping, while the MapReader trait is used to retrieve the mapping.

2. What is the significance of the NULL_INFO static variable?
- The NULL_INFO static variable represents a default FeatureInfo struct that has tensor_index and index_within_tensor fields set to -1. This is used as a default value when a feature ID is not found in the FeatureMapper's map.

3. What is the purpose of the tensor_index and index_within_tensor fields in the FeatureInfo struct?
- The tensor_index field represents the index of the tensor that the feature belongs to, while the index_within_tensor field represents the index of the feature within that tensor. Together, they uniquely identify a feature within a tensor.
